\par }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10767046\charrsid16322966 UNESCO's somewhat arbitrary definition of "book" is: 
\par \~
\par ""Non-periodical printed publication of at least 49 pages excluding covers". 
\par \~
\par The emergence of electronic publishing was supposed to change all that. Yet a bloodbath of unusual proportions has taken place in the last few months. Time Warner's iPublish and\~
MightyWords (partly owned by Barnes and Noble) were the last in a string of resounding failures which cast in doubt the business model underlying digital content. Everything seemed to have gone wrong: the dot.coms dot bombed, 
venture capital dried up, competing standards fractured an already fragile marketplace, the hardware (e-book readers) was clunky and awkward, the software unwieldy, the e-books badly written or already in the public domain. 
\par \~
\par Terrified by the inexorable p
rocess of disintermediation (the establishment of direct contact between author and readers, excluding publishers and bookstores) and by the ease with which digital content can be replicated - publishers resorted to draconian copyright protection measures
 
(euphemistically known as "digital rights management"). This further alienated the few potential readers left. The opposite model of "viral" or "buzz" marketing (by encouraging the dissemination of free copies of the promoted book) was only marginally mor
e successful. 
\par \~
\par Moreover, e-publishing's delivery platform, the Internet, has been transformed beyond recognition since March 2000. 
\par \~
\par From an open, somewhat anarchic, web of networked computers - it has evolved into a territorial, commercial, corporate extension of "brick and mortar" giants, subject to\~government regulation. It\~is less friendly towards\~
independent (small) publishers, the backbone of e-publishing. Increasingly, it is expropriated by publishing and media behemoths. It is treated as a medium for cross promotion, supply chain management, and customer relations management.\~It offers\~
only some minor synergies with\~non-cyberspace, real world, franchises and media properties. The likes of Disney and Bertelsmann\~have swung a full circle from\~considering the Internet to be the next big thing in New Media delivery - to frantic\~
efforts to contain the red ink it oozed all over their otherwise impeccable balance sheets.
\par \~
\par But were the now silent pundits right all the same? Is the future of publishing (and other media industries) inextricably intertwined with the Internet?
\par \~
\par The answer depends on whether an old habit dies hard. Internet\~surfers are used to free content. They are very reluctant to pay for information (with pr
ecious few exceptions, like the "Wall Street Journal"'s electronic edition). Moreover, the Internet, with 3 billion pages listed in the Google search engine (and another 15 billion in "invisible" databases), provides many free substitutes to every informa
t
ion product, no matter how superior. Web based media companies (such as Salon and Britannica.com) have been experimenting with payment and pricing models. But this is besides the point. Whether in the form of subscription (Britannica), pay per view (Quest
ia), pay\~to print (Fathom), sample and pay to buy the physical product\~(RealRead), or micropayments (Amazon) - the public refuses to cough up. 
\par \~
\par Moreover, the advertising-subsidized free content Web site has died together with Web advertising. Geocities - 
a community of free hosted, ad-supported, Web sites purchased by Yahoo! - is now selectively shutting down Web sites (when they exceed a certain level of traffic) to convince their owners to revert to a monthly hosting fee model. With Lycos in trouble in 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname place}}Europe{\*\xmlclose}
, Tripod may well follow suit shortly. Earlier this year, Microsoft has shut down ListBot (a host of discussion lists). Suite101 has stopped paying its editors (content authors) effective January 15th. About.com fired hundreds of category editors
. With the ugly demise of Themestream, WebSeed is the only content aggregator which tries to buck the trend by relying (partly) on advertising revenue.
\par \~
\par Paradoxically, e-publishing's main hope may lie with its ostensible adversary: the library. Unbelievably, e-publishers actually tried to limit the access\~of library patrons\~
to e-books (i.e., the lending of e-books to multiple patrons). But, libraries are not only repositories of knowledge and community centres. They are also dominant promoters of new knowl
edge technologies. They are already the largest buyers of e-books. Together with schools and other educational institutions, libraries can serve as decisive socialization agents and introduce generations of pupils, students, and readers to the possibiliti
es and riches of e-publishing. Government use of e-books (e.g., by the military) may have the same beneficial effect.
\par \~
\par As standards converge (Adobe's Portable Document Format and Microsoft's MS Reader LIT format are likely to be the winners), as hardware i
mproves and becomes ubiquitous (within multi-purpose devices or as standalone higher quality units), as content becomes more attractive (already many new titles are published in both print and electronic formats), as more versatile information taxonomies 
(like the Digital Object Identifier) are introduced, as the\~Internet becomes more gender-neutral,\~polyglot,\~and cosmopolitan\~- e-publishing is likely to recover and flourish. 
\par \~
\par This renaissance will probably be aided by the gradual decline of print magazines and by a strengthening movement for free open source scholarly publishing. The publishing of periodical content and academic\~
research (including, gradually, peer reviewed research) may be already shifting to the Web. Non-fiction and textbooks will follow.\~Alternative models of pricing are already in evidence (author pays to publish, author pays to\~
obtain peer review, publisher pays to publish, buy a physical product and gain access to enhanced online content, and so on). Web site rating agencies\~will hel
p to discriminate between the credible and the in-credible. Publishing is moving - albeit kicking and screaming - online.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966

\par Are content brokers - publishers, distributors, and record companies - a thing of the past?
\par \~
\par In one word: disintermediation
\par \~
\par The gradual removal of layers of content brokering and intermediation - mainly in manufacturing marketing - is the continuation o
f a long term trend. Consider music for instance. Streaming audio on the internet ("soft radio"), or downloadable MP3 files may render the CD obsolete - but they were preceded by radio music broadcasts. But the novelty is that the Internet provides a venu
e for the marketing of niche products and reduces the barriers to entry previously imposed by the need to invest in costly "branding" campaigns and manufacturing and distribution activities.
\par \~
\par This trend is also likely to restore the balance between artists
 and the commercial exploiters of their products. The very definition of "artist" will expand to encompass all creative people. One will seek to distinguish oneself, to "brand" oneself and to auction one's services, ideas, products, designs, experience, p
h
ysique, or biography, etc. directly to end-users and consumers. This is a return to pre-industrial times when artisans ruled the economic scene. Work stability will suffer and work mobility will increase in a landscape of shifting allegiances, head huntin
g, remote collaboration, and similar labour market trends.
\par \~
\par But distributors, publishers, and record companies are not going to vanish. They are going to metamorphose. This is because they fulfil a few functions and provide a few services whose importance is only enhanced by the "free for all" Internet culture.

\par \~
\par Content intermediaries gra
de content and separate the qualitative from the ephemeral and the atrocious. The deluge of self-published and vanity published e-books, music tracks and art works has generated few masterpieces and a lot of trash. The absence of judicious filtering has u
n
justly given a bad name to whole segments of the industry (e.g., small, or web-based publishers). Consumers - inundated, disappointed and exhausted - will pay a premium for content rating services. Though driven by crass commercial considerations, most pu
blishers and record companies do apply certain quality standards routinely and thus are positioned to provide these rating services reliably.
\par \~
\par Content brokers are relationship managers. Consider distributors: they provide instant access to centralized, con
tinuously updated, "addressbooks" of clients (stores, consumers, media, etc.). This reduces the time to market and increases efficiency. It alters revenue models very substantially. Content creators can thus concentrate on what they do best: content creat
i
on, and reduce their overhead by outsourcing the functions of distribution and relationships management. The existence of central "relationship ledgers" yields synergies which can be applied to all the clients of the distributor. The distributor provides 
a single address that content re-sellers converge on and feed off. Distributors, publishers and record companies also provide logistical support: warehousing, consolidated sales reporting and transaction auditing, and a single, periodic payment.
\par \~
\par Yet, havi
ng said all that, content intermediaries still over-charge their clients (the content creators) for their services. This is especially true in an age of just-in-time inventory and digital distribution. Network effects mean that content brokers have to inv
e
st much less in marketing, branding and advertising once a product's first mover advantage is established. Economic laws of increasing, rather than diminishing, returns mean that every additional unit sold yields a HIGHER profit - rather than a declining 
one. The pie is getting bigger.
\par \~
\par Hence, the meteoric increase in royalties publishers pay authors from sales of the electronic versions of their work (anywhere from Random House's 35% to 50% paid by smaller publishers). As this tectonic shift reverberates 
through the whole distribution chain, retail outlets are beginning to transact directly with content creators. The borders between the types of intermediaries are blurred. Barnes and Noble (the American bookstores chain) has, in effect, become a publisher
. Many publishers have virtual storefronts. Many authors sell directly to their readers, acting as publishers. The introduction of "book ATMs" - POD (Print On Demand) machines, which will print \line 
every conceivable title in minutes, on the spot, in "book kios
ks" - will give rise to a host of new intermediaries. Intermediation is not gone. It is here to stay because it is sorely needed. But it is in a state of flux. Old maxims break down. New modes of operation emerge. 
\par \line Functions are amalgamated, outsourced, dispensed with, or created from scratch. It is an exciting scene, full with opportunities.

rn concept of intellectual property. Members register their books, obtain a BCID (BookCrossing ID Number) and then give the book to someone, or simply leave it lying around for a total stranger to find. Henceforth, fate determines the chain of events. Eve
n
tual successive owners of the volume are supposed to report to BookCrossing (by e-mail) about the book's and their whereabouts, thereby generating moving plots and mapping the territory of literacy and bibliomania. This innocuous model subversively underm
i
nes the concept - legal and moral - of ownership. It also expropriates the book from the realm of passive, inert objects and transforms it into a catalyst of human interactions across time and space. In other words, it returns the book to its origins: a t

\par \~
\par }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf17\insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 Some companies are gambling on content distribution and the possession of the attendant digital infrastructure. MightyWords, for example,\~
stealthily transformed itself from a "free-for-all-everyone-welcome" e-publisher to a distribution channel of choice works (mainly by midlist authors). It now aims to feed\~
its content to content-starved web sites. In the process, it shed thousands of unfortunate authors who did not meet its (never stated) sales criteria. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 
\par \~

purchases. It is now the largest e-book store by a wide margin.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 
\par \~
\par }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf17\insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 But Amazon seemed to have got it right once more. The web's own virtual mall and\~the\~former darling of Wall Street has diversified into micropayments.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par \~
\par }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf17\insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 The Internet started as a free medium for free spirits. E-commerce was once considered a dirty word. Web surfers became used to free content. Hence the (very low) 
glass ceiling on the price of content made available through the web - and the need to charge\~customers less than 1 US dollars to a few dollars\~per transaction\~
("micro-payments"). Various service providers (such as Pay-Pal) emerged, none became sufficiently dominant and all-pervasive to constitute a standard.\~Web merchants' ability\~
to accept micropayments is crucial. E-commerce (let alone m-commerce) will never take off without it.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966

e within 30 days and Amazon charges them 15 cents per transaction plus 15(!) percent. By far the worst deal in town.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966

is the greatest asset, greater even than original content and more important than distribution channels and digital right management or asset management applications. Merchants are willing to pay for access to this ever expanding virt

Scindex's Instant Publishing Service is about empowerment. The price of scholarly, peer-reviewed journals has skyrocketed in the last few years, often way out of the limited means of libraries, universities, individual scientists and scholars. A "s
cholarly divide" has opened between the haves (academic institutions with rich endowments and well-heeled corporations) and the haves not (all the others). Paradoxically, access to authoritative and authenticated knowledge has\~
declined as the number of professional journals has proliferated. This is not to mention the long (and often crucial) delays in publishing research results and the shoddy work of many under-paid and over-worked peer reviewers.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

The Internet was suppose to change all that. Originally, a computer network for the exchange of (restricted and open) research results among scientists and academics in participating institutions - it was supposed to provide instant publishing, instant ac
c
ess and instant gratification. It has delivered only partially. Preprints of academic papers are often placed online by their eager authors and subjected to peer scrutiny. But this haphazard publishing cottage industry did nothing to dethrone the print in
cumbents and their avaricious pricing. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966

The major missing element is, of course, respectability. But there are others. No agreed upon content or knowledge classification method has emerged. Some web sites (such as Suite101) use the Dewey decimal system. O
thers invented and implemented systems of their making. Additionally, one click publishing technology (such as Webseed's or Blogger's)\~came to be identified\~strictly to non-scholarly material: personal reminiscences, correspondence, articles and news.}{

is the absence of peer review. As the system moves from beta to commercialization, Scindex intends to address this issue by introducing a system of incentives and inducements. Reviewers will be granted "credit points" to be applied against the (paid) publ

Scientists and scholars\~are getting impatient and rebellious. The confluence of these three trends spells - at the least - the creation of a web based universe of parallel\~and alternative scholarly publishing. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par Latin kidnapped the\~word "plagion"\~from ancient Greek and it ended up in English as "plagiarism". It literally means "to kid
nap" - most commonly, to misappropriate content and wrongly attribute it to oneself. It is a close kin of piracy. But while the software or content pirate does not bother to hide or alter the identity of the content's creator or the software's author - th
e plagiarist does. Plagiarism is, therefore, more pernicious than piracy.

\insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 , it was established by a group of concerned (and commercially minded) scientists from UC Berkeley. 
\par \~
\par Whereas digital rights and asset management systems are geared to prevent piracy - plagiarism.org and its commercial arm, Turnit.com, are\~the cyber equivalent of a law enforcement agency, acting after the fact to discover the cul
prits and uncover their misdeeds. This, they claim, is a first stage on the way to a plagiarism-free Internet-based academic community of both teachers and students, in which the educational potential of the Internet can be fully realized.
\par \~
\par The problem is especially severe in academia. Various surveys have discovered that a staggering 80%(!) of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}US{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} students cheat and\~that at least 30%\~
plagiarize written material. The Internet only exacerbated this problem. More than 200 cheat-sites have sprung up, with thousands of papers available on-line and tens of thousands of satisfied plagiarists the world over. Some of these hubs\~
- like cheater.com, cheatweb\~or cheathouse.com - make no bones about their offerings. Many of them are located outside the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} (in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Germany{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, or {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Asia{\*\xmlclose}) and at least one offers papers in a few languages, Hebrew included.
\par \~
\par The problem, though, is not limited to the ivory towers. E-zines plagiarize. The print media plagiari
ze. Individual journalists plagiarize, many with abandon. Even advertising agencies and financial institutions plagiarize. The amount of material out there is so overwhelming that the plagiarist develops a (fairly justified) sense of\~
immunity. The temptation\~is irresistible, the rewards big and the pressures of\~modern\~life great.
\par \~
\par Some of the plagiarists are straightforward copiers. Others substitute words, add sentences, or combine two or more sources. This raises the question: "when\~should content be con
sidered original and when - plagiarized?". Should the test for plagiarism be more stringent than the one applied by the Copyright Office? And what rights are implicitly granted by the material's\~genuine authors or publishers once\~
they place the content on the Internet? Is the Web a public domain and, if yes, to what extent? These questions are not easily answered. Consider reports generated by users from a database. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid11359516\charrsid16322966 
\par \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 Are these reports copyrighted - and if so, by whom - by the database compiler or by the us
er who defined the parameters, without which the reports in question would have never been generated? What about "fair use" of text and works of art? In the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}
{\*\xmlclose}, the backlash against digital content piracy and plagiarism has reached preposterous legal, litigious and technological nadirs. 
\par \~
\par Plagiarism.org has developed a statistics-based technology (the "Document Source Analysis") which creates a "digital fingerprint" of every document in its database. Web crawlers are then unleashed to s
cour the Internet and find documents with the same fingerprint and a colour-coded report is generated. An instructor, teacher, or professor can then use the report to prove plagiarism and cheating. 
\par \~
\par Piracy is often considered to be a form of viral marketing (even by software developers and publishers). The author's, publisher's, or software house's data are preserved intact in the cracked copy.\~Pirated copies of e-books often\~
contribute to increased sales of the print versions. Crippled versions of software or pirated copies of software without its\~manuals, updates\~and support\~
- often lead to the purchase of a licence. Not so with plagiarism. The identities of the author, editor, publisher and illustrator are deleted and replaced by the details of the plag
iarist. And while piracy is discussed freely and fought vigorously - the discussion of plagiarism is still taboo and\~actively suppressed by image-conscious and endowment-weary academic institutions and media.\~
It is an uphill struggle but plagiarism.org has taken the first resolute step.

\par The recent bloodbath among online content peddlers and digital media proselytisers can be traced to two deadly sins. The first was to assume that traffic equals sales. In other words, that a miraculous conversion will spontaneously occur among the hordes 
of visitors to a web site.\~It was taken as an article of faith that\~
a certain percentage of this mass will inevitably and nigh hypnotically reach for their bulging pocketbooks and purchase content, however packaged. Moreover, ad revenues (more reasonably) w
ere assumed to be closely correlated with "eyeballs". This myth led to an obsession with counters, page hits, impressions, unique visitors, statistics and demographics. 
\par \~
\par It failed, however, to take into account the dwindling efficacy of what Seth Godin, 
in his brilliant essay ("Unleashing the IdeaVirus"), calls "Interruption Marketing" - ads, banners, spam and fliers. It also ignored, at its peril, the ethos of free content and open source prevalent among the Internet opinion leaders, movers and shapers.
 These two neglected aspects of Internet hype and culture led to the trouncing of erstwhile promising web media companies\~while their business models were exposed as wishful thinking. 
\par \~
\par The second mistake was to exclusively cater to the needs of a highly idiosyncratic group of people ({\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Silicone{\*\xmlclose} {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Valley{\*\xmlclose}
{\*\xmlclose} geeks and nerds). The assumption that the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} (let alone the rest of the world) is {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}Silicone{\*\xmlclose} {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Valley{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} writ large proved to be calamitous to the industry. 
\par \~
\par In the 1970s and 1980s, evolutionary biologists like Richard Dawkins and Rupert Sheldrake developed models of cultural evolution. Dawkins' "meme" is a cultural element (like a behaviour or an idea) passed from one individual to another and from on
e generation to another not through biological -genetic means - but by imitation. Sheldrake added the notion of\~
contagion - "morphic resonance" - which causes behaviour patterns to suddenly emerged in whole populations. Physicists talked about sudden "phas
e transitions", the emergent results of a critical mass reached. A latter day thinker, Michael Gladwell, called it the "tipping point".
\par \~
\par Seth Godin invented the concept of an "ideavirus" and an attendant marketing terminology. In a nutshell, he says, to use his own summation: 
\par \~
\par "Marketing by interrupting people isn't cost-effective anymore. You can't afford to seek out people and send them unwanted marketing, in large groups and hope that some will send you money
. Instead the future belongs to marketers who establish a foundation and process where interested people can market to each other. Ignite consumer networks and then get out of the way and let them talk."}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 
\par \~
\par This is sound advice with a shaky conclusion. The conversion from exposure to a marketing message (even from peers within a consumer network) - to an actual\~
sale is a convoluted, multi-layered, highly complex process. It is not a "black box", better left unattended to. It is the same deadly sin all over
 again - the belief in a miraculous conversion. And it is highly US-centric. People in other parts of the world interact entirely differently.
\par \~
\par You can get them to visit and you get them to talk and you can get them to excite others. But to get them to buy - is a whole different ballgame. Dot.coms had better begin to study its rules.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid13844308\charrsid16322966

\par \line A debate is raging in e-publishing circles: should content be encrypted and protected (the Barnes and Noble o
r Digital goods model) - or should it be distributed freely and thus serve as a form of viral marketing (Seth Godin's "ideavirus")? Publishers fear that freely distributed and cost-free "cracked" e-books will cannibalize print books to oblivion. 
\par \~
\par The mor
e paranoid point at the music industry. It failed to co-opt the emerging peer-to-peer platforms (Napster) and to offer a viable digital assets management system with an equitable sharing of royalties. The results? A protracted legal battle and piracy run 
amok. "Publishers" - goes this creed - "are positioned to incorporate encryption and protection measures at the very inception of the digital publishing industry. They ought to learn the lesson." 
\par \~
\par But this view ignores a vital difference between sound and
 text. In music, what matter are the song or the musical piece. The medium (or carrier, or packing) is marginal and interchangeable. A CD, an audio cassette, or an MP3 player are all fine, as far as the consumer is concerned. The listener bases his or her
 purchasing decisions on sound quality and the faithfulness of reproduction of the listening experience (for instance, in a concert hall). This is a very narrow, rational, measurable and quantifiable criterion. 
\par \~
\par Not so with text. 
\par \~
\par Content is only one el
ement of many of equal footing underlying the decision to purchase a specific text-"carrier" (medium). Various media encapsulating IDENTICAL text will still fare differently. Hence the failure of CD-ROMs and e-learning. People tend to consume content in o
t
her formats or media, even if it is fully available to them or even owned by them in one specific medium. People prefer to pay to listen to live lectures rather than read freely available online transcripts. Libraries buy print journals even when they hav
e subscribed to the full text online versions of the very same publications. And consumers overwhelmingly prefer to purchase books in print rather than their e-versions. 
\par \~
\par This is partly a question of the slow demise of old habits. E-books have yet to deve
lop the user-friendliness, platform-independence, portability, browsability and many other attributes of this ingenious medium, the Gutenberg tome. But it also has to do with marketing psychology.\~
 Where text (or text equivalents, such as speech) is concerned, the medium is at least as important as the message. And this will hold true even when e-books catch up with their print brethren technologically. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\insrsid11359516\charrsid16322966 
\par \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 
\par \~
\par There is no doubting that finally e-books will surpass print books as a medium and offer numerous options:\~
 hyperlinks within the e-book and without it - to web content, reference works, etc., embedded instant shopping and ordering links, divergent, user-interactive, decision driven plotlines, interaction with other e-books (using Bluetooth or another wi
reless standard), collaborative authoring, gaming and community activities, automatically or periodically updated content, ,multimedia capabilities, database, Favourites and History Maintenance (records of reading habits, shopping habits, interaction with
 other readers, plot related decisions and much more), automatic and embedded audio conversion and translation capabilities, full wireless piconetworking and scatternetworking capabilities and more. 
\par \~
\par The same textual content will be available in the future in various media. Ostensibly, consumers should gravitate to the feature-rich and much cheaper e-book. But they won't - because the medium is as important as the text message. It is not enough to own
 
the same content, or to gain access to the same message. Ownership of the right medium does count. Print books offer connectivity within an historical context (tradition). E-books are cold and impersonal, alienated and detached. The printed word offers pe
r
manence. Digital text is ephemeral (as anyone whose writings perished in the recent dot.com bloodbath or Deja takeover by Google can attest). Printed volumes are a whole sensorium, a sensual experience - olfactory and tactile and visual. E-books are one d
imensional in comparison. These are differences that cannot be overcome, not even with the advent of digital "ink" on digital "paper". They will keep the print book alive and publishers' revenues flowing. 
\par \~
\par People buy printed matter not merely because of i
ts content. If this were true e-books will have won the day. Print books are a packaged experience, the substance of life. People buy the medium as often and as much as they buy the message it encapsulates. It is impossible to compete with this mistique. 
S
afe in this knowledge, publishers should let go and impose on e-books "encryption" and "protection" levels as rigorous as they do on the their print books. The latter are here to stay alongside the former. With the proper pricing and a modicum of trust, e
-books may even end up promoting the old and trusted print versions.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966

\par There is no source of reference remotely as authoritat
ive as the Encyclopaedia Britannica. There is no brand as venerable and as veteran as this mammoth labour of knowledge and ideas established in 1768. There is no better value for money. And, after a few sputters and bugs, it now comes in all shapes and si
zes, including two CD-ROM versions (standard and deluxe) and an appealing and reader-friendly web site. So, why does it always appear to be on the brink of extinction?
\par \~
\par The Britannica provides for an interesting study of the changing fortunes (and formats)
 of vendors of reference. As late as a decade ago, it was still selling in a leather-imitation bound set of 32 volumes. As print encyclopaedias went, it was a daring innovator and a pioneer of hyperlinked-like textual design. It sported a subject index, a
 lexical part and an alphabetically arranged series of in-depth essays authored by the best in every field of human erudition. 
\par \~
\par When the CD-ROM erupted on the scene, the Britannica mismanaged the transition. As late as 1997, it was still selling a sordid 
text-only compact disc which included a part of the encyclopaedia. Only in 1998, did the Britannica switch to multimedia and added tables and graphs to the CD. Video and sound were to make their appearance even later. This error in trend analysis left the
 field wide open to the likes of Encarta and Grolier. The Britannica failed to grasp the irreversible shift from cumbersome print volumes to slender and freely searchable CD-ROMs. Reference was going digital and the Britannica's sales plummeted.
\par \~
\par The Brita
nnica was also late to cash on the web revolution - but, when it did, it became a world leader overnight. Its unbeatable brand was a decisive factor. A failed experiment with an annoying subscription model gave way to unrestricted access to the full conte
n
ts of the Encyclopaedia and much more besides: specially commissioned articles, fora, an annotated internet guide, news in context, downloads and shopping. The site enjoys healthy traffic and the Britannica's CD-ROM interacts synergistically with its cont
ents (through hyperlinks).
\par \~
\par Yet, recently, the Britannica had to fire hundreds of workers (in its web division) and a return to a pay-for-content model is contemplated. What went wrong again? Internet advertising did. The Britannica's revenue model was bas
ed on monetizing eyeballs, to use a faddish refrain. When the perpetuum mobile of "advertisers pay for content and users get it free" crumbled - the Britannica found itself in familiar dire straits.
\par \~
\par Is there a lesson to be learned from this arduous and convoluted tale? Are works of reference not self-supporting regardless of the revenue model (subscription, ad-based, print, CD-ROM)? This might well be the case. 
\par \~
\par Classic works of reference - from Diderot to the Encarta - offered a series of advantages to their users:
\par \~
\par 1. Authority - Works of reference are authored by experts in their fields and peer-reviewed. This ensures both objectivity and accuracy.
\par \~
\par 2. Accessibility - Huge amounts of material were assembled under one "roof". This abolished the need to scour numerous sources of variable quality to obtain the data one needed.
\par \~
\par 3. Organization - This pile of knowledge was organized in a convenient and recognizable manner (alphabetically or by subject)
\par \~
\par Moreover, authoring an encyclopaedia was such a daunting and expensive task that only states, academic institutions, or well-funded businesses were able to produce them. At any given period there was a de
arth of reliable encyclopaedias, which exercised a monopoly on the dissemination of knowledge. Competitors were few and far between. The price of these tomes was, therefore, always exorbitant but people paid it to secure education for their children and a
 fount of knowledge at home. Hence the long gone phenomenon of "door to door encyclopaedia salesmen" and instalment plans.
\par \~
\par Yet, all these advantages were eroded to fine dust by the Internet. The web offers a plethora of highly authoritative information au
thored and released by the leading names in every field of human knowledge and endeavour. The Internet, is, in effect, an encyclopaedia - far more detailed, far more authoritative, and far more comprehensive that any encyclopaedia can ever hope to be. The
 
web is also fully accessible and fully searchable. What it lacks in organization it compensates in breadth and depth and recently emergent subject portals (directories such as Yahoo! or The Open Directory) have become the indices of the Internet. The afor
ementioned anti-competition barriers to entry are gone: web publishing is cheap and immediate. Technologies such as web communities, chat, and e-mail enable \line 
massive collaborative efforts. And, most important, the bulk of the Internet is free. Users pay only the communication costs.
\par \~
\par The long-heralded transition from free content to fee-based information may revive the fortunes of online reference vendors. But as long as the Internet - with its 2,000,000,000 (!) visible pages (and 5 times as many pages in i
ts databases) - is free, encyclopaedias have little by way of a competitive advantage.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid1845320\charrsid16322966

\par Where is the capital needed to finance content likely to come from? 
\par Again, there are two schools: 
\par According to the first, sites will be financed through advertising -\~ and so will search engines and other applications accessed by users. 
\par Certain ASPs (Application Service Providers which rent out access to application software which resides on their servers) are considering this model. 
\par The recent collapse in online advertising rates and click-through rates raised ser
ious doubts regarding the validity and viability of this model. Marketing gurus, such as Seth Godin went as far as declaring "interruption marketing" (=ads and banners) dead. 
\par The second approach is simpler and allows for the existence of non-commercial content. 
\par It proposes to collect negligible sums (cents or fractions of cents) from every user for every visit ("micro-payments"). These accumulated cents will enable the site-owners to update and to maintain them and encourage entrepreneurs to develop new c
ontent and invest in it. Certain content aggregators (especially of digital textbooks) have adopted this model (Questia, Fathom).

\par Whatever the case may be, a uniform, agreed upon system of rating as a basis for charging advertisers, is sorely needed. There is also the question of what does the advertiser pay for?\~

\par As users / consumers form a habit of using (or consuming) the software 
- it is commercialized and begins to carry a price tag. This is what happened with the advent of cable television : contents are sold for subscription or per usage (Pay Per View - PPV) fees.

Gradually, this is what will happen to most of the sites and sof

\par Sooner or later, the business sector has to mollify the God of public opinion with offerings of political and social nature. The Internet is an affluent, educated, yuppie medium. It requires literacy and numeracy, live interest in information and \line 
its various uses (scientific, commercial, other), a lot of resources (free time, money to invest in hardware, software and connect time). It empowers }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid5112819\charrsid16322966 \endash }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par In short: the Internet is an elitist medium. Publicly, this is an unhealthy posture. "Internetophobia" is already discernible. People (and politicians) talk about how unsafe the Internet is and about its possible uses for}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\insrsid5112819\charrsid16322966  }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 racial, sexist and pornographic purposes. The wider public is in a state of}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid5112819\charrsid16322966  }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 OverDrive - an e-commerce, software conversion and e-publishing applications leader - has just expanded an e-book technology centre by adding 200 e-book editors. This happened in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Montego Bay{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Jamaica{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 - one of the less privileged spots on earth. The centre now provides a vertical e-publishing service - from manuscript editing to 
conversion to Quark (for POD), Adobe, and MS Reader ebook formats. Thus, it is not confined to the classic sweatshop cum production centre so common in Less Developed Countries (LDC's). It is a full fledged operation with access to cutting edge technology
. 
\par The Jamaican OverDrive is the harbinger of things to come and the outcome of a confluence of a few trends. 
\par First, there is the insatiable appetite big publishers (such as McGraw-Hill, Random House, and Harper Collins) have developed to converting their 
hitherto inertial backlists into e-books. Gone are the days when e-books were perceived as merely a novel form of packaging. Publishers understood the cash potential this new distribution channel offers and the value added to stale print tomes in the conv
ersion process. This epiphany is especially manifest in education and textbook publishing. 
\par Then there is the maturation of industry standards, readers and audiences. Both the supply side (title lists) and the demand side (readership) have increased. Giants
 like Microsoft have successfully entered the fray with new e-book reader applications, clearer fonts, and massive marketing. Retailers - such as Barnes and Noble - opened their gates to e-books. A host of independent publishers make good use of the negli
gible-cost distribution channel that the Internet is. Competition and positioning are already fierce - a good sign. 
\par The Internet used to be an English, affluent middle-class, white collar, male phenomenon. It has long lost these attributes. The digital div
ides that opened up with the early adoption of the Net by academe and business - are narrowing. Already there are more women than men users and English is the language of less than half of all web sites. The wireless Net will grant developing countries th
e chance to catch up. 
\par Astute entrepreneurs are bound to take advantage of the business-friendly profile of the manpower and investment-hungry governments of some developing countries. It is not uncommon to find a mastery of English, a college degree in the
 sciences, readiness to work outlandish hours at a fraction of wages in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Germany{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} or the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} - all combined in one employee in these deprived countries. {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}India{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 has sprouted a whole industry based on these competitive endowments. 
\par Here is how Steve Potash, OverDrive's CEO, explains his daring move in OverDrive's press release dated {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}May 22, 2001{\*\xmlclose}: 
\par "Everyone we are partnering with in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}US{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and worldwide has been ve
ry excited and delighted by the tremendous success and quality of eBook production from OverDrive {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Jamaica{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Jamaica{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} has tremendous untapped talent in its young people. {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Jamaica{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 is the largest English-speaking nation in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Caribbean{\*\xmlclose}
 and their educational and technical programs provide us with a wealth of quality candidates for careers in electronic publishing. We could not have had this success without the support and responsiveness of the Jamaican
 government and its agencies. At every stage the agencies assisted us in opening our technology centre and staffing it with trained and competent eBook professionals. OverDrive Jamaica will be pioneering many of the advances for extending books, reference
 materials, textbooks, literature and journals into new digital channels - and will shortly become the foremost centre for eBook automation serving both US and international markets". 
\par Druanne Martin, OverDrive's Director of publishing services elaborates: 
\par ""With {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Jamaica{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Cleveland{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname 
City}}Ohio{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} sharing the same time zone (EST), we have our {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}US{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and Jamaican production teams in sync. {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Jamaica{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} provides a beautiful and warm climate, literally, for
 us to build long-term partnerships and to invite our publishing and content clients to come and visit their books in production". 
\par The Jamaican Minister of Industry, Commerce and Technology, the Hon. Phillip Paulwell reciprocates: 
\par "We are proud that OverDrive has selected {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Jamaica{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} to extend its leadership in eBook technology. OverDrive is benefiting from the investments 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Jamaica{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} has made in developing the needed infrastructure for IT companies to locate and build skilled workforces here." 
\par There is nothing new in outsourcing back office work (insurance claims processing, air ticket reservations, medical records maintenance) to third world countries, such as (the notable example) {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}India{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. Research and Development is routinely farmed out to aspiring first world countries such as {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Israel{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Ireland{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. But OverDrive's Jamaican facility is an example of something more sophisticated and more durable. Western firms are discove
ring the immense pools of skills, talent, innovation, and top notch scientific and other education often offered even by the poorest of nations. These multinationals entrust the locals now with more than keyboarding and responding to customer queries usin
g fake names. The Jamaican venture is a business partnership. In a way, it is a topsy-turvy world. Digital animation is produced in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}India{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 and consumed in the States. The low compensation of scientists attracts the technology and R&D arms of the likes of General Electric to {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Asia{\*\xmlclose} and Intel to {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Israel{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. In other words, there are budding signs of a reversing brain drain - from West to East. 
\par E-publishing is at the forefront of software engineering, e-consumerism, intellec
tual property technologies, payment systems, conversion applications, the mobile Internet, and, basically, every important trend in network and computing and digital content. Its migration to warmer and cheaper climates may be inevitable. OverDrive sounds
 happy enough. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966

\par The Internet is too rich. Even powerful and sophisticated search engines, such as Google, return a lot of trash, dead end
s, and Error 404's in response to the most well-defined query, Boolean operators and all. Directories created by human editors - such as Yahoo! or the Open Directory Project - are often overwhelmed by the amount of material out there. Like the legendary b
l
ob, the Internet is clearly out of classificatory control. Some web sites - like Suite101 - have introduced the old and tried Dewey subject classification system successfully used in non-virtual libraries for more than a century. Books - both print and el
e
ctronic - (actually, their publishers) get assigned an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) by national agencies. Periodical publications (magazines, newsletters, bulletins) sport an ISSN (International Serial Standard Number). National libraries dol
e
 out CIP's (Cataloguing in Publication numbers), which help lesser outfits to catalogue the book upon arrival. But the emergence of new book formats, independent publishing, and self publishing has strained this already creaking system to its limits. In s
hort: the whole thing is fast developing into an awful mess. 
\par Resolution is one solution. 
\par Resolution is the linking of identifiers to content. An identifier can be a word, or a phrase. RealNames implemented this approach and its proprietary sof
tware is now incorporated in most browsers. The user types a word, brand name, phrase, or code, and gets re-directed to a web site with the appropriate content. The only snag: RealNames identifiers are for sale. Thus, its identifiers are not guaranteed to
 lead to the best, only, or relevant resource. Similar systems are available in many languages. Nexet, for example, provides such a resolution service in Hebrew. 
\par The Association of American Publishers (APA) has an Enabling Technologies Committee. Fittingly
, at the Frankfurt Book Fair of 1997, it announced the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) initiative. An International DOI Foundation (IDF) was set up and invited all publishers - American and non-American alike - to apply for a unique DOI prefix. DOI is act
u
ally a private case of a larger system of "handles" developed by the CNRI (Corporation for National Research Initiatives). Their "Handle Resolver" is a browser plug-in software, which re-directs their handles to URL's or other pieces of data, or content. 
Without the Resolver, typing in the handle simply directs the user to a few proxy servers, which "understand" the handle protocols. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid1779159\charrsid16322966 
\par \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 
\par The interesting (and new) feature of the system is its ability to resolve to MULTIPLE locations (URL's, or data, or conten
t). The same identifier can resolve to a Universe of inter-related information (effectively, to a mini-library). The content thus resolved need not be limited to text. Multiple resolution works with audio, images, and even video.

Capable of providing much richer experiences then single resolution to a URL, Multiple Resolutio
n operates on the premise that content, not its location, is identified. In other words, where content and related resources reside is secondary information. Multiple Resolution enables content owners and distributors to identify their intellectual proper
ty with bound collections of related resources at a hyperlink's point of departure, instead of requiring a user to leave the page to go to a new location for further information. \line 
A content owner controls and manages all the related resources in each of the
se menus and can determine which information is accessible to each business partner within the supply chain. When an administrator changes any facet of this information, the change is simultaneous on all internal networks and the Internet. A DOI is a perm

 (categorized by book formats), information about the title and the author, digital rights management information (permissions), and more. The DOI server generates this information in "real time", "on the fly". But it is the author, or (more often) the pu

ly the content resolved to. 
\par Which brings us to e-publishing.

The DOI Foundation has unveiled the DOI-EB (EB stands for e-books) Initiative in the Book Expo America Show 2001, to, in their words:
\par "Determine requirements with respect to the application of unique identifiers to eBooks\line Develop proofs-of-concept for the use of DOIs with eBooks\line Develop technical demonstrations, possibly including a prototype eBook Registration Agency."
\par It is backed by a few major publishers, such as McGraw-Hill, Random House, Pearson, and Wiley.
\par This ostensibly modest agenda conceals a revolutionary and ambitious attempt to unambiguously identify the origin of digital content (in this case, e-books) and link a universe of information to each and every ID number. Aware of competin
g efforts underway, the DOI Foundation is actively courting the likes of "indecs" (Interoperability of Data in E-Commerce System) and OeBF (Open e-Book). Companies ,like Enpia Systems of South Korea (a DOI Registration Agency), have already implemented a 
D
OI-cum-indecs system. On November 2000, the APA's (American Publishers' Association) Open E-book Publishing Standards Initiative has recommended to use DOI as the primary identification system for e-books' metadata. The MPEG (Motion Pictures Experts Group
)
 is said to be considering DOI seriously in its efforts to come up with numbering and metadata standards for digital videos. A DOI can be expressed as a URN (Universal Resource Name - IETF's syntax for generic resources) and is compatible with OpenURL (a 
s
yntax for embedding parameters such as identifiers and metadata in links). Shortly, a "Namespace Dictionary" is to be published. It will encompass 800 metadata elements and will tackle e-books, journals, audio, and video. A working group was started to de
velop a "services definition" interface (i.e., to allow web-enabled systems, especially e-commerce and m-commerce systems, to deploy DOI).
\par The DOI, in other words, is designed to be all-inclusive and all-pervasive. Each DOI number is made of a prefix, speci
fic to a publisher, and a suffix, which could end up painlessly assimilating the ISBN and ISSN (or any other numbering and database) system.\~
\par Thus, a DOI can be assigned to every e-book based on its ISBN and to every part (chapter, section, or page) of eve
ry e-book. This flexibility could support Pay Per View models (such as Questia's or Fathom's), POD (Print On Demand), and academic "course packs", which comprise material from many textbooks, whether on digital media or downloadable. The DOI, in other wor
ds, can underlie D-CMS (Digital Content Management Systems) and Electronic Catalogue ID Management Systems.
\par Moreover, the DOI is a paradigm shift (though, conceptually, it was preceded by the likes of the UPC code and the ISO's HyTime multimedia standard). 
It blurs the borders between types of digital content. Imagine an e-novel with the video version of the novel, the sound track, still photographs, a tourist guide, an audio book, and other digital content embedded in it. Each content type and each segment
 of each content type can be identified and tagged separately and, thus, sold separately - yet all under the umbrella of the same DOI! The nightmare of DRM (digital rights management) may be finally over.\~}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\insrsid2959360\charrsid16322966 ). In other words, as opposed to the URL (Universa
l Resource Locator) - it is generated dynamically, "on the fly", by the user, and is not "hard coded" into the web page. This is because the DOI identifies content - not its location. And while the URL resolves to a single web page - the DOI resolves to a
 
lot more in the form of publisher-controlled (ONIX-XML) "metadata" in a pop-up (Javascript or other) screen. The metadata include everything from the author's name through the book's title, edition, blurbs, sample chapters, other promotional material, lin
k
s to related products, a rights and permissions profile, e-mail contacts, and active links to retailers' web pages. Thus, every book-related web page becomes a full fledged book retailing gateway. The "anchor document" (in which the DOI is embedded) remai
ns uncluttered. ONIX 2.0 may contain standard metadata fields and extensions specific to e-publishing and e-books.
\par This latter feature - the ability to link to the systems of retailers, distributors, and other types of vendors - is the "barcode" function of
 the DOI. Like barcode technology, it helps to automate the supply chain, and update the inventory, ordering, billing and invoicing, accounting, and re-ordering databases and functions. Besides tracking content use and distribution, the DOI allows to seam
lessly integrate hitherto disparate e-commerce technologies and facilitate interoperability among DRM systems.
\par The resolution itself can take place in the client's browser (using a software plug-in), in a proxy server, or in a central, dynamic server. Resol
ving from the client's PC, e-book reader, or PDA has the advantage of being able to respond to the user's specific condition (location, time of day, etc.). No plug-in is required when a proxy server HTTP is used - but then the DOI becomes just another URL
,
 embedded in the page when it is created and not resolved when the user clicks on it. The most user-friendly solution is, probably, for a central server to look up values in response to a user's prompt and serve her with cascading menus or links. Admitted
l
y, in this option, the resolution tables (what DOI links to what URL's and to what content) is not really dynamic. It changes only with every server update and is static between updates. But this is a minor inconvenience. As it is, users are likely to res
pond with some trepidation to the need to install plug-ins and to the avalanche of information their single, innocuous, mouse click generates.

\par The DOI is assigned to publishers by Registration Agencies (of which there are currently three - CrossRef and Content Directions in the States and the aforementioned Enpia Systems in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Asia{\*\xmlclose}
). It is already widely used to cross reference almost 5,000 periodicals with a database of 3,000,000 citations. The price is steep - it costs a publisher $200 to get a pref
ix and submit DOI's to the registry. But as Registration Agencies proliferate, competition is bound to slash these prices precipitously.

\par The circulation of print magazines has declined precipitously in the last 24 months. This dissolution of subscriber bases has accelerated dramatically as economic recession set in. But a diminishing wealth effect is only partly to blame. The managements o
f printed periodicals - from dailies to quarterlies - failed miserably to grasp the Internet's potential and\~
 potential threat. They were fooled by the lack of convenient and cheap e-reading devices into believing that old habits die hard. They do - but mag
azine reading is not habit forming. Readers' loyalties are fickle and shift according to content and price. The Web offers cornucopial and niche-targeted content - free of charge or very cheaply. This is hard to beat and is getting harder by the day as na
tural selection among dot.bombs spares only quality content providers.\~ 
\par Consider Ploughshares, the Literary Journal. 
\par It is a venerable, not for profit, print journal published by {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Emerson{\*\xmlclose} {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}College{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
, now marking its 30th anniversary. It
 recently inaugurated its web sibling. The project consumed three years and $125,000 (grant from the Wallace-Reader's Digest Funds). Every title Ploughshares has ever published was indexed (over 18,000 journal pages digitized). In all, the "website will o
ffer free access to over 2,750 poems and short stories from past and current issues." 
\par The more than 2000 (!) authors ever published in Ploughshares will each maintain a personal web page comprising biographical notes, press releases, new books and events a
nnouncements and links to other web sites. This is the Yahoo! formula. Content generated by the authors will thus transform Ploughshares into a leading literary portal.\line \line 
But Ploughshares did not stop at this standard features. A "bookshelf" will link to bo
ok reviews contributed online (and augmented by the magazine's own prestigious offerings). An annotated bookstore is just a step away (though Ploughshares' web site does not include one hitherto). The next best thing is a rights-management application use
d by\~ the journal's authors to grant online publishing permissions for their work to third parties.\line \line No print literary magazine can beat this one stop shop. So, how can print publications defend themselves? 
\par By being creative and by not conceding defeat is how. 
\par Consider WuliWeb's example of thinking outside the printed box. 
\par }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid7411017 \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 
It is a simple online application which enables its users to "send, save and share material from print publications". Participating magazines and newspapers print "WuliCodes" on their 
(physical) pages and WuliWeb subscribers barcode-scan, or manually enter them into their online "Content Manager" via keyboard, PDA, pager, cell phone, or fixed phone (using a PIN). The service is free (paid for by the magazine publishers and advertisers)
 and, according to WuliWeb, offers these advantages to its users: 
\par "Once you choose to use WuliWeb's free service, you will no longer have to laboriously "tear and share" print articles or ads that you want to archive or share with colleagues or friends. Yo
u will be able to store material sourced from print publications permanently in your own secure, electronic files, and you can share this material instantly with any number of people. Magazine and Newspaper Publishers will now have the ability to distribu
te their online content more widely and to offer a richer experience to their readers. Advertisers will be able to deploy dynamic and media-rich content to\line 
attract and convert customers, and will be able to communicate more completely with their customers." 
\par Links to the shared material are stored in WuliWeb's central database and users gain access to them by signing up for a (free) WuliWeb account. Thus, the user's mailbox is unencumbered by huge downloads. Moreover, WuliWeb allows for a keywords-based sear
ch of articles saved.\~ 
\par Perhaps the only serious drawback is that WuliWeb provides its users only with LINKS to content stored on publishers' web sites. It is a directory service - not a full text database. This creates dependence. Links may get broken. Wh
ole web sites vanish. Magazines and their publishers go under. All the more reason for publishers to adopt this service and make it their own.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966

It is amazing that the traditional archivists of human knowledge - the libraries - failed so spectacularly to ride the tiger of the Internet, that epit
ome and apex of knowledge creation and distribution. At first, libraries, the inertial repositories of printed matter, were overwhelmed by the rapid pace of technology and by the ephemeral and anarchic content it spawned. They were reduced to providing ac
c
ess to dull card catalogues and unimaginative collections of web links. The more daring added online exhibits and digitized collections. A typical library web site is still comprised of static representations of the library's physical assets and a few qua
si-interactive services.\~ 
\par This tendency - by both publishers and libraries - to inadequately and inappropriately pour old wine into new vessels is what caused the recent furor over e-books.\~\line \line The lending of e-books to patrons appears to be a natural extens
ion of the classical role of libraries: physical book lending. Libraries sought also to extend their archival functions to e-books. But librarians failed to grasp the essential and substantive differences between the two formats. E-books can be easily, st
e
althily, and cheaply copied, for instance. Copyright violations are a real and present danger with e-books. Moreover, e-books are not a tangible product. "Lending" an e-book - is tantamount to copying an e-book. In other words, e-books are not books at al
l. They are software products. Libraries have pioneered digital collections (as they have other information technologies throughout history) and are still the main promoters of e-publishing. But now they are at risk of becoming piracy portals.\~ 
\par Solutions a

 the number of its reading devices and terminals. Another possibility is to implement the shareware model - a trial period followed by a purchase option or an expiration, a-la Rosetta's expiring e-book.\~\line \line

 digital content, brandable pages and web based tools for each participating library to customize for their patrons. Patrons of participating libraries will then be able to browse digital content online, or download and check out the content they are most
 interested in. Content may be checked out for an extended period of time set by each library, including checking out eBooks from home." Still, it seems that B&T's approach is heavily influenced by software licencing ("one copy one use").\line \line

underlying, fundamental incompatibility between the Internet and the library. They are competitors. One vitiates the other. Free Internet access and e-book reading devices in libraries notwithstanding - the Internet, unless harnessed and integrated by lib

\par UNESCO's arbitrary and ungrounded definition of "book" is: 
\par ""Non-periodical printed publication of at least 49 pages excluding covers". 
\par But a book, above all else, is a medium. It encapsulates information (of one kind or another) and conveys it across time and space. Moreover, as opposed to common opinio
n, it is - and has always been - a rigidly formal affair. Even the latest "innovations" are nothing but ancient wine in sparkling new bottles. 
\par Consider the scrolling protocol. Our eyes and brains are limited readers-decoders. There is only that much that 
the eye can encompass and the brain interpret. Hence the need to segment data into cognitively digestible chunks. There are two forms of scrolling - lateral and vertical. The papyrus, the broadsheet newspaper, and the computer screen are three examples of
 the vertical scroll - from top to bottom or vice versa. The e-book, the microfilm, the vellum, and the print book are instances of the lateral scroll - from left to right (or from right to left, in the Semitic languages).\~ 
\par In many respects, audio books are much more revolutionary than e-books. They do not employ visual symbols (all other types of books do), or a straightforward scrolling method. E-books, on the other hand, are a throwback to the days of the papyrus.\~
 The text cannot be opened at any point 
in a series of connected pages and the content is carried only on one side of the (electronic) "leaf". Parchment, by comparison, was multi-paged, easily browseable, and printed on both sides of the leaf. It led to a revolution in publishing and to the pri
n
t book. All these advances are now being reversed by the e-book. Luckily, the e-book retains one innovation of the parchment - the hypertext. Early Jewish and Christian texts (as well as Roman legal scholarship) was written on parchment (and later printed
) and included numerous inter-textual links. The Talmud, for example, is made of a main text (the Mishna) which hyperlinks on the same page to numerous interpretations (exegesis) offered by scholars throughout generations of Jewish learning.\~\~ 
\par Another dist
inguishing feature of books is portability (or mobility). Books on papyrus, vellum, paper, or PDA - are all transportable. In other words, the replication of the book's message is achieved by passing it along and no loss is incurred thereby (i.e., there i
s no physical metamorphosis of the message). }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid9140214\charrsid16322966 
\par \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 
The book is like a perpetuum mobile. It spreads its content virally by being circulated and is not diminished or altered by it. Physically, it is eroded, of course - but it can be copied faithfully. It is permanent.\~ 
\par Not so the e-book or the CD-ROM. Both are dependent on devices (readers or drives, respectively). Both are technology-specific and format-specific. Changes in technology - both in hardware and in software - are liable to render many e-books unreada
ble. And portability is hampered by battery life, lighting conditions, or the availability of appropriate infrastructure (e.g., of electricity).\~ 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 II. The Constant Content Revolution}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966  
\par Every generation applies the same age-old principles to new "content-con
tainers". Every such transmutation yields a great surge in the creation of content and its dissemination. The incunabula (the first printed books) made knowledge accessible (sometimes in the vernacular) to scholars and laymen alike and liberated books fro
m the scriptoria and "libraries" of monasteries. The printing press technology shattered the content monopoly. In 50 years (1450-1500), the number of books in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Europe{\*\xmlclose}
 surged from a few thousand to more than 9 million! And, as McLuhan has noted, it shifted the emphasis from the oral mode of content distribution (i.e., "communication") to the visual mode. 
\par E-books are threatening to do the same. "Book ATMs" will provide Print on Demand (POD) services to faraway places. People in remote corners of the earth
 will be able to select from publishing backlists and front lists comprising millions of titles. Millions of authors are now able to realize their dream to have their work published cheaply and without editorial barriers to entry. The e-book is the Intern
e
t's prodigal son. The latter is the ideal distribution channel of the former. The monopoly of the big publishing houses on everything written - from romance to scholarly journals - is a thing of the past. In a way, it is ironic. Publishing, in its earlies
t forms, was a revolt against the writing (letters) monopoly of the priestly classes. It flourished in non-theocratic societies such as {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Rome{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, or 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}China{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} - and languished where religion reigned (such as in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Sumeria
{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Egypt{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, the Islamic world, and Medieval Europe).

With e-books, content will once more become a collaborative effort, as it has been well into the Middle Ages. Authors and audience used to interact (remember Socrates) to generate knowledge, informatio
n, and narratives. Interactive e-books, multimedia, discussion lists, and collective authorship efforts restore this great tradition. Moreover, as in the not so distant past, authors are yet again the publishers and sellers of their work. The distinctions
 
between these functions is very recent. E-books and POD partially help to restore the pre-modern state of affairs. Up until the 20th century, some books first appeared as a series of pamphlets (often published in daily papers or magazines) or were sold by
 
subscription. Serialized e-books resort to these erstwhile marketing ploys. E-books may also help restore the balance between best-sellers and midlist authors and between fiction and textbooks. E-books are best suited to cater to niche markets, hitherto n
eglected by all major publishers. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid9140214\charrsid16322966

\insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966  
\par E-books are the quintessential "literature for the millions". They are cheaper than even paperbacks. John Bell (competing with Dr. Johnson) published "The Poets of Great Britain" in 1777
-83. Each of the 109 volumes cost six shillings (compared to the usual guinea or more). The Railway Library of novels (1,300 volumes) costs 1 shilling apiece only eight decades later. The price continued to dive throughout the next century and a half. E-b
ooks and POD are likely to do unto paperbacks what these reprints did to originals. Some reprint libraries specialized in public domain works, very much like the bulk of e-book offering nowadays. 
\par The plunge in book prices, the lowering of barriers to entry
 due to new technologies and plentiful credit, the proliferation of publishers, and the cutthroat competition among booksellers was such that price regulation (cartel) had to be introduced. Net publisher prices, trade discounts, list prices were all anti-
competitive inventions of the 19th century, mainly in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Europe{\*\xmlclose}
. They were accompanied by the rise of trade associations, publishers organizations, literary agents, author contracts, royalties agreements, mass marketing, and standardized copyrights.\~ 
\par The
 sale of print books over the Internet can be conceptualized as the continuation of mail order catalogues by virtual means. But e-books are different. They are detrimental to all these cosy arrangements. Legally, an e-book may not be considered to constit
u
te a "book" at all. Existing contracts between authors and publishers may not cover e-books. The serious price competition they offer to more traditional forms of publishing may end up pushing the whole industry to re-define itself. Rights may have to be 
r
e-assigned, revenues re-distributed, contractual relationships re-thought. Moreover, e-books have hitherto been to print books what paperbacks are to hardcovers - re-formatted renditions. But more and more authors are publishing their books primarily or e
xclusively as e-books. E-books thus threaten hardcovers and paperbacks alike. They are not merely a new format. They are a new mode of publishing. 
\par Every technological innovation was bitterly resisted by Luddite printers and publishers: stereotyping, the ir
on press, the application of steam power, mechanical typecasting and typesetting, new methods of reproducing illustrations, cloth bindings, machine-made paper, ready-bound books, paperbacks, book clubs, and book tokens. Without exception, they relented an
d
 adopted the new technologies to their considerable commercial advantage. It is no surprise, therefore, that publishers were hesitant to adopt the Internet, POD, and e-publishing technologies. The surprise lies in the relative haste with which they came t
o adopt it, egged on by authors and booksellers.

\par Despite the technological breakthroughs that coalesced to form the modern printing press - printed books in the 17th and 18th centuries were derided by the
ir contemporaries as inferior to their laboriously hand-made antecedents and to the incunabula. One is reminded of the current complaints about the new media (Internet, e-books), its shoddy workmanship, shabby appearance, and the rampant piracy. }{\rtlch

\par \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 The firs
t decades following the invention of the printing press, were, as the Encyclopedia Britannica puts it "a restless, highly competitive free for all ... (with) enormous vitality and variety (often leading to) careless work".\~ 
\par There were egregious acts of piracy - for instance, the illicit copying of the Aldine Latin "pocket books", or the all-pervasive piracy in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}England{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 in the 17th century (a direct result of over-regulation and coercive copyright monopolies). Shakespeare's work was publis
hed by notorious pirates and infringers of emerging intellectual property rights. Later, the American colonies became the world's centre of industrialized and systematic book piracy. Confronted with abundant and cheap pirated foreign books, local authors 
resorted to freelancing in magazines and lecture tours in a vain effort to make ends meet. 
\par Pirates and unlicenced - and, therefore, subversive - publishers were prosecuted under a variety of monopoly and libel laws (and, later, under national security and 
obscenity laws). There was little or no difference between royal and "democratic" governments. They all acted ruthlessly to preserve their control of publishing. John Milton wrote his passionate plea against censorship, Areopagitica, in response to the 16
43 licencing ordinance passed by Parliament. The revolutionary Copyright Act of 1709 in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}England{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 established the rights of authors and publishers to reap the commercial fruits of their endeavours exclusively, though only for a prescribed period of time.

\par The battle between industrial-commercial publishers (fortified by ever more potent technologies) and the arts and craftsmanship crowd never ceased and it is raging now as fiercely as e
ver in numerous discussion lists, fora, tomes, and conferences. William Morris started the "private press" movement in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}England{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 in the 19th century to counter what he regarded as the callous commercialization of book publishing. When the 
printing press was invented, it was put to commercial use by private entrepreneurs (traders) of the day. Established "publishers" (monasteries), with a few exceptions (e.g., in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
Augsburg{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Germany{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Subiaco{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Italy
{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}) shunned it and regarded it as a major threat to culture and civilization. Their attacks on printing read like the litanies against self-publishing or corporate-controlled publishing today.\~ 
\par But, as readership expanded (women and the poor became in
creasingly literate), market forces reacted. The number of publishers multiplied relentlessly. At the beginning of the 19th century, innovative lithographic and offset processes allowed publishers in the West to add illustrations (at first, black and whit
e
 and then in color), tables, detailed maps and anatomical charts, and other graphics to their books. Battles fought between publishers-librarians over formats (book sizes) and fonts (Gothic versus Roman) were ultimately decided by consumer preferences. Mu
ltimedia was born. The e-book will, probably, undergo a similar transition from being the static digital rendition of a print edition - to being a lively, colorful, interactive and commercially enabled creature.\~ 
\par The commercial lending library and, later, 
the free library were two additional reactions to increasing demand. As early as the 18th century, publishers and booksellers expressed the fear that libraries will cannibalize their trade. Two centuries of accumulated experience demonstrate that the oppo
site has happened. Libraries have enhanced book sales and have become a major market in their own right.

\par Publishing has always been a social pursuit and depended heavily on social developments, such as the spread of literacy and the liberation of minorities (especially, of women).\~
As every new format matures, it is subjected to regulation from within and from without. E-books (and, by extension, digital content on the Web) will be no exception. Hence the recurrent and current attempts at regulation.\~ 
\par Every new variant of content packaging was labeled as "dangerous" at its inception. The Church (formerly the largest publisher of bibles and other religious and "earthly" texts and the upholder and protector of reading in 
the Dark Ages) castigated and censored the printing of "heretical" books (especially the vernacular bibles of the Reformation) and restored the Inquisition for the specific purpose of controlling book publishing. In 1559, it published the Index Librorum P
r
ohibitorum ("Index of Prohibited Books"). A few (mainly Dutch) publishers even went to the stake (a habit worth reviving, some current authors would say...). European rulers issued proclamations against "naughty printed books" (of heresy and sedition). Th
e printing of books was subject to licencing by the Privy Council in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}England{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
. The very concept of copyright arose out of the forced registration of books in the register of the English Stationer's Company (a royal instrument of influence 
and intrigue). Such obligatory registration granted the publisher the right to exclusively copy the registered book (often, a class of books) for a number of years - but politically restricted printable content, often by force. Freedom of the press and fr
ee speech are still distant dreams in many corners of the earth. The Digital\~Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),\~
the V-chip and other privacy invading, dissemination inhibiting, and censorship imposing measures perpetuate a veteran if not so venerable tradition.\~

\par The more it changes, the more it stays the same. If the history of the book teaches us anything it is that there are no limits to the ingenuity with which publishers, authors, and booksellers, re-invent old practices. Technol
ogical and marketing innovations are invariably perceived as threats - only to be adopted later as articles of faith. Publishing faces the same issues and challenges it faced five hundred years ago and responds to them in much the same way. Yet, every gen
e
ration believes its experiences to be unique and unprecedented. It is this denial of the past that casts a shadow over the future. Books have been with us since the dawn of civilization, millennia ago. In many ways, books constitute our civilization. Thei
r traits are its traits: resilience, adaptation, flexibility, self re-invention, wealth, communication. We would do well to accept that our most familiar artifacts - books - will never cease to amaze us. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par Similar and much larger treasures have perished since the dawn of the digital age in the 1920's. Very few early radio and TV programs have survived, for instance. The curre
nt "digital dark age" can be compared only to the one which followed the torching of the Library of Alexandria. The more accessible and abundant the information available to us - the more devalued and common it becomes and the less institutional and cultu
ral memory we seem to possess. In the battle between paper and screen, the former has won formidably. Newspaper archives, dating back to the 1700's are now being digitized - testifying to the endurance, resilience, and longevity of paper.
\par Enter the "Internet Libraries", or Digital Archival Repositories (DAR). These are libraries that provide free access to\~
 digital materials replicated across multiple servers ("safety in redundancy"). They contain Web pages, television programming, films, e-books, archives o
f discussion lists, etc. Such materials can help linguists trace the development of language, journalists conduct research, scholars compare notes, students learn, and teachers teach. The Internet's evolution mirrors closely the social and cultural histor

 at the end of the 20th century. If not preserved, our understanding of who we are and where we are going will be severely hampered. The clues to our future lie ensconced in our past. It is the only guarantee against repeating the mis
takes of our predecessors. Long gone Web pages cached by the likes of Google and Alexa constitute the first tier of such archival undertaking.\~

The handle is the clever numerical result of a mathematical formula whose input is the number of information bits in the original object being deposited. This allows to track and uniquely identify records ac

\par Data storage is the first phase. It is not as simple as it sounds. The proliferation of formats of digital content has made it necessary to develop a st
andard for archiving Internet objects. The size of the digitized collections must pose a serious challenge as far as timely retrieval is concerned. Interoperability issues (numerous formats and readers) probably requires software and hardware plug-ins to 
render a smooth and transparent user interface.
\par Moreover, as time passes, digital data, stored on magnetic media, tend to deteriorate. It must be copied to newer media every 10 years or so ("migration"). Advances in hardware and software applications render
 many of the digital records indecipherable (try reading your word processing files from 1981, stored on 5.25" floppies!). Special emulators of older hardware and software must be used to decode ancient data files. And, to ameliorate the impact of inevita
ble natural disasters, accidents, bankruptcies of publishers, and politically motivated destruction of data - multiple copies and redundant systems and archives must be maintained.\~
As time passes, data formatting "dictionaries" will be needed. Data preservation is hardly useful if the data cannot be searched, retrieved, extracted, and researched. And, as "The Economist" put it ("The Economist Technology Quarterly, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}September 22nd, 2001{\*\xmlclose}), without a "Rosetta Stone" of data formats, future deciphering of stored the data might prove to be an insurmountable obstacle.
\par Last, but by no means least, Internet libraries are Internet based. They themselves are as ephemeral as the historical record they aim to preserve. This tenuous cyber existence g
oes a long way towards explaining why our paperless offices consume much more paper than ever before.\~}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966

{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Israel{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. The publishing house belongs to {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Israel{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
's leading (and exceedingly wealthy) newspaper. I signed a contract which stated that I am entitled to receive 8% of the income from the sales of the book after commissions paya
ble to distributors, shops, etc. A few months later (1997), I won the coveted Prize of the Ministry of Education (for short prose). The prize money (a few thousand DMs) was snatched by the publishing house on the legal grounds that all the money generated
 by the book belongs to them because they own the copyright. 
\par In the mythology generated by capitalism to pacify the masses, the myth of intellectual property stands out. It goes like this : if the rights to intellectual property were not defined and enforc
ed, commercial entrepreneurs would not have taken on the risks associated with publishing books, recording records, and preparing multimedia products. As a result, creative people will have suffered because they will have found no way to make their works 
accessible to the public. Ultimately, it is the public which pays the price of piracy, goes the refrain. 
\par But this is factually untrue. In the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} there is a very limited group of authors who actually live by their pen. Only select musici
ans eke out a living from their noisy vocation (most of them rock stars who own their labels - George Michael had to fight Sony to do just that) and very few actors come close to deriving subsistence level income from their profession. All these can no lo
nger be thought of as mostly creative people. Forced to defend their intellectual property rights and the interests of Big Money, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Schwarzenegger and Grisham are businessmen at least as much as they are artists. 
\par Economically and rationally, we should expect that the costlier a work of art is to produce and the narrower its market - the more emphasized its intellectual property rights. 
\par Consider a publishing house. 
\par A book which costs 50,000 DM to produce with a potential audience of
 1000 purchasers (certain academic texts are like this) - would have to be priced at a a minimum of 100 DM to recoup only the direct costs. If illegally copied (thereby shrinking the potential market as some people will prefer to buy the cheaper illegal c
o
pies) - its price would have to go up prohibitively to recoup costs, thus driving out potential buyers. The story is different if a book costs 10,000 DM to produce and is priced at 20 DM a copy with a potential readership of 1,000,000 readers. Piracy (ill
egal copying) should in this case be more readily tolerated as a marginal phenomenon. 
\par This is the theory. But the facts are tellingly different. The less the cost of production (brought down by digital technologies) - the fiercer the battle against piracy.
 The bigger the market - the more pressure is applied to clamp down on samizdat entrepreneurs. 
\par Governments, from {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}China{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} to {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Macedonia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
, are introducing intellectual property laws (under pressure from rich world countries) and enforcing them belatedly. But where one factory is closed on shore (as has been the case in mainland {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}China{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}) - two sprout off shore (as is the case in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Hong Kong{\*\xmlclose} and in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Bulgaria
{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}). 
\par But this defies logic : the 
market today is global, the costs of production are lower (with the exception of the music and film industries), the marketing channels more numerous (half of the income of movie studios emanates from video cassette sales), the speedy recouping of the inv
e
stment virtually guaranteed. Moreover, piracy thrives in very poor markets in which the population would anyhow not have paid the legal price. The illegal product is inferior to the legal copy (it comes with no literature, warranties or support). So why s
hould the big manufacturers, publishing houses, record companies, software companies and fashion houses worry? 
\par The answer lurks in history. Intellectual property is a relatively new notion. In the near past, no one considered knowledge or the fruits of cre
ativity (art, design) as 'patentable', or as someone's 'property'. The artist was but a mere channel through which divine grace flowed. Texts, discoveries, inventions, works of art and music, designs - all belonged to the community and could be replicated
 
freely. True, the chosen ones, the conduits, were honoured but were rarely financially rewarded. They were commissioned to produce their works of art and were salaried, in most cases. Only with the advent of the Industrial Revolution were the embryonic pr
e
cursors of intellectual property introduced but they were still limited to industrial designs and processes, mainly as embedded in machinery. The patent was born. The more massive the market, the more sophisticated the sales and marketing techniques, the 
b
igger the financial stakes - the larger loomed the issue of intellectual property. It spread from machinery to designs, processes, books, newspapers, any printed matter, works of art and music, films (which, at their beginning were not considered art), so
ftware, software embedded in hardware, processes, business methods, and even unto genetic material. 
\par Intellectual property rights - despite their noble title - are less about the intellect and more about property. This is Big Money : the markets in intellec
tual property outweigh the total industrial production in the world. The aim is to secure a monopoly on a specific work. This is an especially grave matter in academic publishing where small- circulation magazines do not allow their content to be quoted o
r published even for non-commercial purposes. The monopolists of knowledge and intellectual products cannot allow competition anywhere in the world - because theirs is a world market. A pirate in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}Skopje{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} is in direct competition with Bill Gates. Whe
n he sells a pirated Microsoft product - he is depriving Microsoft not only of its income, but of a client (=future income), of its monopolistic status (cheap copies can be smuggled into other markets), and of its competition-deterring image (a major mono
poly preserving asset). This is a threat which Microsoft cannot tolerate. Hence its efforts to eradicate piracy - successful in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}China{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 and an utter failure in legally-relaxed {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Russia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. 
\par But what Microsoft fails to understa
nd is that the problem lies with its pricing policy - not with the pirates. When faced with a global marketplace, a company can adopt one of two policies: either to adjust the price of its products to a world average of purchasing power - or to use discre
tionary differential pricing (as pharmaceutical companies were forced to do in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Brazil{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}South Africa{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}). A Macedonian with an average monthly income of 160 USD clearly cannot afford to buy the Encyclopaedia Encarta Deluxe. In {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname 
City}}America{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, 50 USD is the income generated in 4 hours of an average job. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid9140214\charrsid16322966 
\par \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 In Macedonian terms, therefore, the Encarta is 20 times more expensive. Either the price should be lowered in the Macedonian market - or an average world pric
e should be fixed which will reflect an average global purchasing power. 
\par Something must be done about it not only from the economic point of view. Intellectual products are very price sensitive and highly elastic. Lower prices will be more than compensate
d for by a much higher sales volume. There is no other way to explain the pirate industries : evidently, at the right price a lot of people are willing to buy these products. High prices are an implicit trade-off favouring small, elite, select, rich world
 clientele. This raises a moral issue : are the children of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Macedonia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 less worthy of education and access to the latest in human knowledge and creation ? 
\par Two developments threaten the future of intellectual property rights. One is the In
ternet. Academics, fed up with the monopolistic practices of professional publications - already publish on the web in big numbers. I published a few book on the Internet and they can be freely downloaded by anyone who has a computer or a modem. The full 
t
ext of electronic magazines, trade journals, billboards, professional publications, and thousands of books is available online. Hackers even made sites available from which it is possible to download whole software and multimedia products. It is very easy
 
and cheap to publish on the Internet, the barriers to entry are virtually nil. Web pages are hosted free of charge, and authoring and publishing software tools are incorporated in most word processors and browser applications. As the Internet acquires mor
e impressive sound and video capabilities it will proceed to threaten the monopoly of the record companies, the movie studios and so on. 
\par The second development is also technological. The oft-vindicated {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Moore{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}'s law predicts the doubling of computer
 memory capacity every 18 months. But memory is only one aspect of computing power. Another is the rapid simultaneous advance on all technological fronts. Miniaturization and concurrent empowerment by software tools have made it possible for individuals t
o
 emulate much larger scale organizations successfully. A single person, sitting at home with 5000 USD worth of equipment can fully compete with the best products of the best printing houses anywhere. CD-ROMs can be written on, stamped and copied in house.
 
A complete music studio with the latest in digital technology has been condensed to the dimensions of a single chip. This will lead to personal publishing, personal music recording, and the to the digitization of plastic art. But this is only one side of 
the story. 
\par The relative advantage of the intellectual property corporation does not consist exclusively in its technological prowess. Rather it lies in its vast pool of capital, its marketing clout, market positioning, sales organization, and distribution network. 

\par Nowadays, anyone can print a visually impressive book, using the above-mentioned cheap equipment. But in an age of information glut, it is the marketing, the media campaign, the distribution, and the sales that determine the economic outcome. 
\par This advantage, however, is also being eroded. 
\par First, there is a psychological shift, a reaction to the commercialization of intellect and spirit. Creative people are repelled by what they regard as an oligarchic establishment of institutionalized, lowest c
ommon denominator art and they are fighting back. 
\par Secondly, the Internet is a huge (200 million people), truly cosmopolitan market, with its own marketing channels freely available to all. Even by default, with a minimum investment, the likelihood of bein
g seen by surprisingly large numbers of consumers is high.

\par The demise of intellectual property has lately become abundantly clear. The old intellectual property industries are fighting tooth and nail to preserve 
their monopolies (patents, trademarks, copyright) and their cost advantages in manufacturing and marketing.
\par But they are faced with three inexorable processes which are likely to render their efforts vain:

\par Print newspapers offer package deals of cheap content subsidized by advertising. In other words, the advertisers pay for content formation and generation and the reader has no choice but be exposed to commercial messages as he or she studies the content. 

\par This model - adopted earlier by radio and television - rules the internet now and will rule the wireless internet in the future. Content will be made available free of all pecuniary charges. The consumer will pay by providing his personal data (demographi
c data, consumption patterns and preferences and so on) and by being exposed to advertising. Subscription based models are bound to fail.

Thus, content creators will benefit only by sharing in the advertising cake. They will find it increasingly difficult to implement the old models of royalties paid for access or of ownership of intellectual property.

\insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966  
\par A lot of ink has been spilt regarding this important trend. The removal of layers of brokering and intermediation - mainly on the manufacturing and marketing levels - is a historic development (though the continuation of a long term trend). 
\par Consider music for instance. Streaming audio on the internet or downloadable MP3 files will render the CD obsolete. The internet also provides a venue f
or the marketing of niche products and reduces the barriers to entry previously imposed by the need to engage in costly marketing ("branding") campaigns and manufacturing activities. 
\par This trend is also likely to restore the balance between artist and the 
commercial exploiters of his product. The very definition of "artist" will expand to include all creative people. One will seek to distinguish oneself, to "brand" oneself and to auction off one's services, ideas, products, designs, experience, etc. }{

In a fragmented market with a myriad of mutually exclusive market niches, consumer preferences and marketing and sales channels - economies of scale in manufacturing and distribution are meaningless. Narrowcasting replaces broadcasting, mass cust
omization replaces mass production, a network of shifting affiliations replaces the rigid owned-branch system. The decentralized, intrapreneurship-based corporation is a late response to these trends. The mega-corporation of the future is more likely to a
ct as a collective of start-ups than as a homogeneous, uniform (and, to conspiracy theorists, sinister) juggernaut it once was. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid9140214\charrsid16322966 {\*\bkmkstart territorial}

\par The Net was supposed to dissolve anachronistic national borders and 
cultural boundaries. It was expected to vitiate distance - both physical and mental. It was hailed as the invention that will unify Mankind and harmonize (though not homogenize) civilizations, east and west.
\par Yet, this was not to be. As dot.coms bombed, the
ir more veteran and more experienced brick and mortar rivals took over the Net, transforming it in the process into a giant content delivery, marketing, supply chain management, and customer relationship management platform. This evolution all but demolis
hed the non-local nature of the early Internet. It has also brought it into the remit of existing national laws.
\par Moreover, governments throughout the world have become more assertive in exercising territorial jurisdiction over the hitherto ostensibly extrat
erritorial Net. A French court has prohibited Yahoo! from making certain content on its Web sites available to French citizens. An American court advised Yahoo! to ignore this decision. A Russian programmer was arrested by the FBI for offering a decryptio
n software for sale in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Russia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} (where it is perfectly legal). Governments from {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}
}China{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} to {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Saudi Arabia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} filter Web content regularly. Following the September 11 attacks, restrictive anti-terrorist legisla
tion the world over targeted cyberspace.
\par But the real territorialization of the Internet - the redrawing of its internal contours and the withdrawal of its libertarian foundations - is more pernicious, all-pervasive, quotidian, and surreptitiously gradual.
 This is not the outcome of legal revolutions and court-driven evolution. It is piecemeal, quiet, unnoticed, often inadvertent and unintended. It is an "afterthought" rather than a premeditated "plot". It happens e-tailer by e-tailer, one Web site after t
he other, like the spread of a virus.
\par Consider these two - by no means exhaustive - examples. 
\par Amazon and Geocities (now, Yahoo!Geocities) are two Internet establishments, two gigantic communities of users that, between them, represent a sizable chunk of all the activity on the Internet. 
\par It has long been impossible for a non-{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}US{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 publisher to sell its wares (books, for instance) through Amazon or to Amazon directly. Amazon works exclusively with US publishers and distributors. To collaborat
e with Amazon - one of the members of a duopoly as far as B2C e-commerce goes - a non-US publisher (no matter how substantial) has to work with a {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}US{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 distributor and thus forgo a large portion of its revenues (payable to the distributor as commissions). Moreover, said publisher cannot even open a ZShop (Amazon's version of mom and pop store). One has to be a {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}US{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} resident to do so. Amazon is closed to the outside world, despite its (false) global image. It sells all over the world - but it only buys American.
\par This discriminatory behaviour is partly profit-motivated. It is logistically easier and cheaper to deal only with US businesses. But Barnes and Noble works directly with foreign publishers and they preceded Amazon in the book business by decades. }{

\par \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10767046\charrsid16322966 
\par Yahoo!Geocities has lately instituted a new policy. It limits the size of downloads from the free home pages of members of its community. If the downloaded content from a given home page exceeds 3 Gb (extrapolated based on h
ourly usage) - the "offending" member's page is shut down for an hour. The member is then prompted to pay a monthly subscription fee for a Premium Service in order avoid a recurrence of this unfortunate event. This "marketing drive" is intended to compens
ate Yahoo!Geocities for a precipitous drop in online advertising revenues.
\par The "Premium" package includes "Premium Mail". But only US citizens or residents can subscribe to it. And, you guessed it right, without the Premium Mail component, one cannot comple
te the subscription process. Though not stated explicitly anywhere, the Premium services are closed to the outside world and are the exclusive reserve of Americans. One can get around this virtual ethnic cleansing by providing false data while registering
, but this is besides the point.
\par The Internet is a reflection of the outside world. As economies
 contract, unemployment soars, personal safety vanishes, the social fabric disintegrates, and consumption slumps - countries tend to isolate themselves politically, react aggressively, and protect their national economies. Protectionism, unilateralism, an
d isolationism are scourges the Internet was supposed to be immune to. Little did we know.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966

\par People are conditioned to trust written words, not to mention images. "I read it in the paper" or "As seen on TV" are worn out but still effective clich\'e9
s. The Internet combines both the written and the seen. It is both a textual and a visual (and audio) medium. Do people trust Internet content? Is the incredible Internet - credible?
\par In the "brick and mortar" world, credibility is associated with brands. A brand, in effect, guarantees the quality and specifications of a product (think McDonald's hamburgers)
, its performance (think Palm), level of service and commitment to customer care (Amazon), variety, or price (Wal-Mart). Brands are sustained and enhanced by advertising campaigns. The content or sales pitch of specific ads are often less important than t
he message conveyed by the very existence of a campaign: "This company is rich enough (read: stable, reliable, trustworthy, here to stay) to spend millions on advertising".\~ 
\par The Internet has very few brands (Yahoo!, Amazon) - and some of them are tarnished
. Some "old media" brands have entered the fray (Barnes and Noble, The Wall Street Journal, the Britannica) - hitherto without much success. The overwhelming bulk of Web content is created or disseminated by small time entrepreneurs and monomaniacs. 

\par So, how does one establish or acquire credibility in such a diffuse and anarchic medium?

The Credibility Web discovered that trust in e-commerce is also influenced by idiosyncratic factors. Certain domain names (org) are more trusted than others (com). Too many ads, broken links, typos, outdated or old content - all dim
inish trust. In the absence of proven markers and behavioral guidelines, people seem to resort to extrapolation ("if they can't maintain their own Web site ...") and stereotypes (e.g., NGO's are more trustworthy than corporations).
\par As Web sites proliferate
 (Google indexes well over 3 billion now) and Web authoring becomes a routine task - the noise to signal ratio of garbage to useful information is bound to deteriorate. Search engines already incorporate crude measures of credibility in their rankings (e.
g., the number of links from external Web sites). But, to remain useful, search engines (and Web directories) would do well to rate Web content more comprehensively and thoroughly. They should rank Web sites by\~
 authoritativeness, reliability, and objectivity, for instance. 
\par Research shows that 75% of all respondents resort to the Internet as a primary information provider. The inundation of irrelevant material caused most surfers to confine their surfing to 10 Web sites (the equivalent of "anchors" in shopp
ing malls), which they deem reliable, timely, accurate, objective, authoritative, and credible. The rest of the Internet gets the leftovers.\~
 This worrying trend can be reversed only through the emergence of independent and commercially-viable rating agenc
ies. Web sites (at least the business ones) should be willing to pay for credible rating to enhance their stickiness and attract monetizable "eyeballs". In the absence of such third party accreditation, the Internet risks both irrelevance and disrepute.}{

\par The answer is: no one knows. Many self-styled "gurus" and "pundits" - authors of voluminous tomes they sell to the gullible - pretend to know. But their "expertise" is an admixture of guesswork, superstition
s, anecdotal "evidence" and hearsay. The sad truth is that no methodical, long term, and systematic research has been attempted in the nascent field of e-publishing and, more broadly, digital content on the Web. So, no one knows to say for sure whether fr
ee content sells, when, or how.
\par There are two schools - apparently equally informed by the dearth of hard data. One is the "viral school". Its vocal proponents claim that the dissemination of free content fuels sales by creating "buzz" (word of mouth market
ing driven by influential communicators). The "intellectual property" school roughly says that free content cannibalizes paid content mainly because it conditions potential consumers to expect free information. Free content also often serves as a substitu
te (imperfect but sufficient) to paid content.
\par Experience - though patchy - confusingly seems to points both ways. Views and prejudices tend to converge around this consensus: whether free content sells or not depends on a few variables. They are:
\par (1) }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 The nature of the information.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 
 People are generally willing to pay for specific or customized information, tailored to their idiosyncratic needs, provided in a timely manner, and by authorities in the field. The more general and "featureless" the information, t
he more reluctant people are to dip into their pockets (probably because there are many free substitutes).
\par (2) }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 The nature of the audience.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 
 The more targeted the information, the more it caters to the needs of a unique, or specific group, the more often it 
has to be updated ("maintained"), the less indiscriminately applicable it is, and especially if it deals with money, health, sex, or relationships - the more valuable it is and the more people are willing to pay for it. The less computer savvy users - una
ble to find free alternatives - are more willing to pay.
\par (3) }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 Time dependent parameters.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 
 The more the content is linked to "hot" topics, "burning" issues, trends, fads, buzzwords, and "developments" - the more likely it is to sell regardless of the availability of free alternatives.
\par (4) }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 The "U" curve.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 
 People pay for content if the free information available to them is either (a) insufficient or (b) overwhelming. People will buy a book if the author's Web site provides only a few tantalizing excerpts. But they are equally likely to buy the book if its 
e
ntire full text content is available online and overwhelms them. Packaged and indexed information carries a premium over the same information in bulk. Consumer willingness to pay for content seems to decline if the amount of content provided falls between
 these two extremes. They feel sated and the need to acquire further information vanishes. Additionally, free content must really be free. People resent having to pay for free content, even if the currency is their personal data.
\par (5) }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 Frills and bonuses. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 The
re seems to be a weak, albeit positive link between willingness to pay for content and "members only" or "buyers only" frills, free add-ons, bonuses, and free maintenance. Free subscriptions, discount vouchers for additional products, volume discounts, ad
d-on, or "piggyback" products - all seem to encourage sales. Qualitative free content is often perceived by consumers to be a BONUS - hence its enhancing effect on sales.
\par (6) }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 Credibility.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966  The credibility and positive track record of both content creator and
 vendor are crucial factors. This is where testimonials and reviews come in. But their effect is particularly strong if the potential consumer finds himself in agreement with them. In other words, the motivating effect of a testimonial or a review is ampl
ified when the customer can actually browse the content and form his or her own opinion. Free content encourages a latent dialog between the potential consumer and actual consumers (through their reviews and testimonials). 
\par (7) }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 Money back warranties or guarantees. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 
These are really forms of free content. The consumer is safe in the knowledge that he can always return the already consumed content and get his money back. In other words, it is the consumer who decides whether to transform the content from free t
o paid by not exercising the money back guarantee. 
\par (8) }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 Relative pricing.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 
 Information available on the Web is assumed to be inherently inferior and consumers expect pricing to reflect this "fact". Free content is perceived to be even more shoddy. The coupl
ing of free ("cheap", "gimcrack") content with paid content serves to enhance the RELATIVE VALUE of the paid content (and the price people are willing to pay for it). It is like pairing a medium height person with a midget - the former would look taller b
y comparison. 
\par (9) }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 Price rigidity. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 
Free content reduces the price elasticity of paid content. Normally, the cheaper the content - the more it sells. But the availability of free content alters this simple function. Paid content cannot be too cheap or it wil
l come to resemble the free alternative ("shoddy", "dubious"). But free content is also a substitute (however partial and imperfect) to paid content. Thus, paid content cannot be priced too high - or people will prefer the free alternative. Free content, 
in other words, limits both the downside and the upside of the price of paid content. 
\par There are many other factors which determine the interaction of free and paid content. Culture plays an important role as do the law and technology. But as long as the fi
eld is not subject to a research agenda the best we can do is observe, collate - and guess.

\cf17\insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 The battle
 between owners of content and its users extends to all corners of the publishing world. Following a brief period of enthusing about "synergies", most media companies, content aggregators, content providers - movie and recording studios, publishers, news 
o
rganizations - came to view the digitization of content as a threat rather than an opportunity. In an effort to protect their intellectual property rights, publishing and recording corporations have fostered the radicalization of copyright law (mainly in 
t
he DMCA - the Digital Millennium Copyright Act). They have also retarded the fair use of copyrighted material and the rights and traditional privileges enjoyed by content users. This was achieved mainly by incorporating "rights management" or "asset manag
e
ment" technologies into readers of digital records (such as e-books). These technologies prevented users from copying the files they purchased, from converting them to audio, from lending them to others (as they would a print book), and from reading them 
on more than one device.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966

\par \~
\par }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf17\insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 The price of scholarly, peer-reviewed journals has skyrocketed in the last\~three decades, often way out of the limited means of libraries
, universities, individual scientists and scholars. A "scholarly divide" has opened between the haves (the negligible minority of academic institutions with rich endowments and well-heeled corporations) and the haves not (all the others). Paradoxically, d
u
e to rising costs, access to authoritative and authenticated knowledge has declined as the number of professional journals has proliferated. This is not to mention the long (and often crucial) delays in publishing research results and the shoddy work of m
any under-paid and over-worked peer reviewers.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966

The Internet was suppose to change all that. Originally, a computer network for the exchange of (restricted and open) research results among scientists and academics in participating institutions - it was sup
posed to provide instant publishing, instant access, and instant gratification. It has delivered only partially. Preprints of academic papers are often placed online by their eager authors and subjected to peer scrutiny. But this haphazard publishing cott
age industry did nothing to dethrone the print incumbents and their avaricious pricing. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966

Q: In "Revolt of the Poor", I wrote: "If the rights to intellectual property were not defined and
 enforced, commercial entrepreneurs would not have taken on the risks associated with publishing books, recording records, and preparing multimedia products. As a result, creative people will have suffered because they will have found no way to make their
 
works accessible to the public. Ultimately, it is the public which pays the price of piracy." Is there any proven connection between the enforcement (or even the existence) of intellectual property rights - and the preponderance of creativity and/or of me
dia entrepreneurship (publishing, etc.)? 
\par 
\par A:\~ I don't have the relevant expertise to answer for music, software, general literature, or even scholarly books.\~ But for scholarly journal articles (the main focus of the FOS movement), there seems to be very l
ittle or no connection between copyright and the productivity and creativity of authors.\~ I say this for two reasons.\~ First, scholarly authors tend to transfer copyright in their articles to the journals that publish them.\~
 (Most scholars don't realize that they could probably negotiate a different arrangement, but that's another issue.)\~ For most journal articles, then, copyright protects publishers, not authors.\~
 But this hasn't stopped scholars from writing journal articles.\~ Second, authors of scholarly journal articles are not paid for them, whether they transfer copyright or not.\~
 Authors consent to this practice and willingly submit their articles to journals that don't pay for submissions.\~ Scholarly authors are paid by their institutions, not by readers, which frees them from the market in deciding what to write.\~
 They are rewarded by making a contribution to knowledge and advancing their own careers, not by cash.\~ Hence, the "unauthorized copying" prohibited by copyright law doesn't deprive these authors of money, but only readers.\~
 Copyright law (at least when used in the traditional way to restrict access to paying customers) gets in the way.\~ Widespread copying with or without permission would give authors of journal articles more readers and mor
e impact, without depriving them of any revenue.\~ But copyright law generally prohibits this kind of copying.\~ Even though this limit on free distribution is contrary to their interests, it clearly hasn't deterred authors from writing more articles. 
\line \line Having said that, let me add that the FOS movement doesn't need to abolish or even reform copyright law.\~
 If authors of scholarly journal articles retain the copyright to their articles (transferring only, say, the right of first print publication, and perhaps
 some other rights), then authors can consent to widespread copying and finally let copyright advance their interests rather than those of publishers.\~
 In particular, authors could consent to put their writings on the internet without any financial, legal, or technical barriers to access.\~
 This is what the FOS movement is trying to achieve, and it can all happen within the boundaries of existing copyright law. \line \~
\par Q: Could you describe the crisis in scholarly publishing?\line \line A: The main problem is that the prices of journals (both print and online journals) have risen faster than inflation and faster than library budgets for three decades.\~
 Libraries cope by canceling subscriptions, or by taking from their book budgets to enlarge their serials (journal) budgets, or both.\~
 One result is that even researchers at the wealthiest institutions do not have access to all the journals they need for their research.\~ Or, from the other end of the author-reader relationship, authors of journal articles cannot reach all the r
eaders who would benefit from the results of their research.\~ When research is slowed and obstructed in this way, so are all the benefits of research, such as new medicines.\line \line 
Another way to put the underlying economic problem is that the huge savings that can be achieved by publishing to the internet haven't yet done anything to bring down the costs of scholarly journals.\~
 One reason is that most journals still have print editions whose costs are unaffected by the internet revolution.\~ Another reason is tha
t the online editions of most journals use expensive software to permit access to paying subscribers and block access to everyone else.\~
 The internet is only a revolutionary medium of nearly costless dissemination for those who don't manage subscription lists and don't try to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized readers.\~ \line \line 
There are other dimensions to the scholarly publishing crisis.\~ One is that journal publishers (like software publishers) are moving beyond copyright law to licensing contracts give them even more protection.\~
 Publishers don't let libraries "buy" or "own" copies of electronic journals, but only "license" them.\~ As a result, libraries aren't assured that they have long-term access rights to these journals, they have diminished r
ights to lend their copies, and their patrons have diminished fair-use rights.\~ They are getting much less and paying much more.\line \line If there were no alternative, that would be one thing.\~
 But there is an alternative to the near monopoly concentration in the scholarly publishing industry.\~ There is an alternative to harsh licensing contracts.\~
 And above all, the internet gives us an alternative method of dissemination that widens distribution and lowers cost at the same time.\~ Even if there were no crisis, the opportunity afforded by the internet would be too beautiful to ignore.\~
 Given the crisis, it's inexcusable. \line \~\line Q: What is Free Online Scholarship and how can it be reconciled with rights to intellectual property? Can the current revenue models of publishe
rs be replaced with viable alternative revenue models - and, if yes, which are they? What the risks of abuse of FOS? Is FOS an instance of a larger "free content" movement (Napster, etc.)? If so, can Free Online Content principles be applied to music, boo
ks, and film. for instance?\line \line A: Free online scholarship is scientific and scholarly literature which is made available free of charge on the internet.\~
 The FOS movement singles out this body of literature not because it is useful (because other kinds of literature are useful too), but because it has the relevant peculiarity that its authors don't expect to be paid.\~
 If authors want to make money from their works, we don't criticize or pressure them.\~ But when authors consent to do without royalties, then there's no reason not to make their writings freely available on the internet.\~
 When the literature is as useful as research articles are, then free online access is a public good\~ worth every effort to realize.\line \line Once we understand that the scope of the FOS m
ovement is limited to works that authors consent to give away, or to publish without payment, then we can understand why this movement is completely compatible with intellectual property rights.\~
 When authors write articles, they are the copyright holders.\~
 A growing number of journals will use their peer review process to vet and validate articles, and ultimately publish them, without demanding that authors give up copyright --and we hope to launch more journals with this enlightened policy.\~ If the autho
rs of peer-reviewed articles holds the copyright to them, then they have the right to decide whether to make access free or restricted.\~ If they choose to make it free and open, that is their right, not an infringement of their right.\~
 The FOS movement is about using copyright to authorize free and open access, not about piracy that creates free access without the consent of the copyright holder.\line \line 
This movement has nothing interesting in common with the movement created by Napster.\~ The all-important difference is that researchers give away their journal articles and musicians don't give away their music.\~
 We work entirely within the consent of the copyright holder.\line \~
\par Q:\~ }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf17\insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 The major missing element\~seems to be perceived\~respectability. But there are others. No
 agreed upon content or knowledge classification method has emerged. Some web sites (such as Suite101) use the Dewey decimal system. Others invented and implemented systems of their making. Additionally, one click publishing technology (such as Webseed's 
or Blogger's) came to be identified strictly with non-scholarly material: personal reminiscences, correspondence, articles, and news. Above all, no feasible alternative revenue models seem to have emerged.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

umber of free online *peer-reviewed* journals, and growing number of highly respected academics willing to serve on their editorial boards.\~ As measured by impact (citations) or informal prestige, some online journals surpass many print journals.\~
 It's true that print journals still have greater impact and prestige than online journals, but only if we average the two classes.\~ The factors that create respectability are medium-independent, and can\~ easily belong to online journals.\~
 A growing number of online journals are as respectable as any print journal. BMJ (formerly called the British Medical Journal) is eminently respectable.\~ It offers 100% of its print copy online free of charge.\~ There are other examples in every field.
\line \line My view is that the lack of an agreed upon classification method is not a problem.\~ That's a long conversation.\~ But it's not true that the need for such a classification method is widely felt.\~
 Indexing and organization are desirable, but there is free and priced software to index and organize any online content in any way that users want.\~ This software will only get better as time goes on.\line \line 
It's not true that no feasible alternative revenue models have emerged.\~ FOS doesn't depend on volunteer labor.\~ The general revenue model is to pay for outgoing articles (dissemination) rather than incoming articles (access).\~
 There are many variations on the theme, depending on who pays.\~ But it's perfectly feasible to regard the costs of dissemination as part of the cost of research, to be paid by the grant that funds the research --for example.\~
 (This is just one variation on the theme.)\~ BioMed Central is a *for-profit* provider of FOS implementing one variation on this theme.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10967902\charrsid16322966 
\par \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 \line \line In a general introduction to the FOS movement I'm writing for another journal, I'm putting it this way.\~
 The economic feasibility of FOS is no more mysterious than the economic feasibility of Public TV.\~ Donors pay the costs of dissemination so that it will be free for everyone.\~ For that matter, it's no more mysterio
us than the economics of commercial TV, which is identical except that advertisers are among the donors.\~
 There are many successful and sustainable examples in our economy in which some people pay to make a good free for everyone rather than pay only for their own private access or consumption.\line \~\line 
Q. Can you summarize for us the major developments and trends in FOS? \line \line A: Here are some trends in the FOS movement:\line \line A growing number of disciplines have free online preprint archives. Every discipline now has a g
rowing number of free online peer-reviewed journals. A growing number of universities have free online archives for faculty research papers. Journal publishers are experimenting with ways to offer more of their content online, some of it free of charge.\~
 They are also experimenting with different ways to fund the costs of the online content. More journal publishers are allowing authors to put their published papers online free of charge e.g. on their own home pages.\~
 It is increasingly common to see journal editors rebel against journal publishers that refuse to lower subscription prices or widen online access.\~
 They rebel by resigning and launching new journals on the same topics and usually gather the same subscribers and a superior "impact factor" very qu
ickly. More scholars and researchers are demanding that journals offer free online access to their contents.\~
 The Public Library of Science open letter has so far gathered more than 29,000 signatures from 175 countries. More online repositories of digital 
articles are participating in the Open Archives Initiative, and more scholars and task forces are endorsing it.\~ It is the emerging standard for making separate archives\~
"interoperable" --for example, searchable as if they were one. More serious, feasible 
solutions are emerging to the problem of long-term preservation of digital content. More journals and special initiatives are seeking ways to provide developing countries with free online access to scientific and scholarly literature. More software tools 
exist to automate the operation of online journals (hence, to keep costs low).\~ Just about all tasks can now be automated except editorial judgment (which shouldn't be, of course).\~
 More hiring and tenure committees are giving weight to peer-reviewed public
ations without regard to the medium of publication (print or electronic). More journal publishers are seeking ways to accommodate the scholarly demand for online access (though not always to accommodate the demand for free online\~
access). The serials prici
ng crisis which has long alarmed and mobilized librarians is starting to alarm and mobilize university administrators and faculty. Copyright law is changing from a balance between publishers and readers toward a severe imbalance favoring publishers.\~
 (See next question below.)\line \line The recent Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) is promising for several reasons.\~
 It brings together FOS proponents from many disciplines and nations, FOS initiatives from many fronts, and foundations with serious resources to help advance the cause.\~
 These foundations are led by George Soros' Open Society Institute, which convened the meeting that gave birth to the BOAI.
\par }\pard \ltrpar\ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\wrapdefault\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0\pararsid476195 {\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 \page \line \line One thing I like about the BOAI is its friendliness.\~
 It doesn't demand that journals or publishers join the cause or face sanctions.\~ It offers to help them make the transition if they are willing to do so.\~ But if they aren't willing, it simply says it will pursue the cause without their help.\~
 The BOAI doesn't demand any changes from publishers, markets, or legislation, and doesn't criticize anyone for not joining.\~ It articulates two strategies that scholars can pursue on their own.\~
 One is self-archiving, by which scholars deposit their papers in institutional or disciplinary archives.\~ (These archives are i
nteroperable, or they cooperate with one another, by virtue of their compliance with the standards of the Open Archives Initiative.)\~
 The second is the launch of a new generation of journals that are committed to making their contents freely accessible online. \line \line The long-term economic sustainability of free online scholarship is not a problem.\~
 We know this because creating open online access to this literature costs much less than traditional forms of dissemination and much less than the money currently spent on journal subscriptions.\~ The only problem is the transition from here to there.\~
 The BOAI is especially promising because it understands this and mobilizes the financial resources to help make the transition possible for existing journals that would 
like to change their business model, new journals that need to establish themselves, and universities that don't yet participate in self-archiving.\~
 In this sense the BOAI is not just a statement of principles or ideals, but a serious and effective plan to achieve this very important public good.\line \~\line Q. Copyright laws are being revamped the world over (but mainly in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}). What would be the impact of the likes of the DMCA on scholarship and on the economics of publishing?\line \line A. The DMCA ha
s several harmful consequences for scholarship.\~ First, it prevents some scientists who happen to specialize in encryption and data security from publishing their research.\~ Edward Felten of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Princeton{\*\xmlclose}
 has so far been unable to get a court to declare that he has a First Amendment right to publish his research on certain methods of copy protection.\~ Taken at face value, the DMCA would punish Felten for publishing his research.\~
 Until courts settle the question whether the relevant sections of the DMCA are constitutional, the free expression rights of scholars like Felten will be chilled.\~
 And of course if the question is resolved in favor of the DMCA, then the free expression rights of scholars like Felten will be repealed.\~ Second, it prevents some compu
ter scientists from publishing their research in the form of source code, the technical language of their field.\~
 While some courts have held that source code is protected as a kind of speech, other courts are giving it a low level of protection in order to give effect to DMCA prohibitions on certain kinds of software.\~
 Third, it supports strong copy-protection schemes that deprive readers of their fair-use rights.\~ For the same reason, it deprives purchasers of digital content of the right to bypass copy p
rotection in order to make personal back-up copies or to keep the content readable when they move to a new computer.\~
 For the same reason, it prevents libraries from taking necessary measures to assure the long-term access and preservation of digital literature. The DMCA is even\~
worse for software developers and consumers than it is for scholars. This week Felten dropped his appeal.\~ So currently no court is even considering his question whether scholars have a First Amendment right to publish their researc
h, or whether the anti-circumvention clause of the DMCA (which seems to prohibit Felten from publishing) is unconstitutional.
\par }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid6361696\charrsid16322966 
\par }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid476195\charrsid16322966 Note that the FOS movement has no problem with the strong protection of intellectual property, which is at the heart of the DMCA.\~ That's not the problem.\~
 The problem is the way the DMCA upsets a long-standing (and constitutionally mandated) balance between publishers and readers and gives nearly everything to publishers. \line \line Because internet content crosses national boundaries, one 
nation will often want to enforce the copyright judgments of its own courts, interpreting its own laws, in another country.\~
 Worldwide developments in parallel to the DMCA, like the still evolving Hague Convention on Jurisdiction and Foreign Judgments, are giving effect to these desires.\~
 The problem is that these efforts, like the DMCA, put intellectual property rights above free speech rights.\~ The same rules that let a nation enforce a copyright judgment beyond its own boundaries also let it enforce a ce
nsorship judgment beyond its own boundaries.\~ Until recently, the border-crossing potential of the internet was a feature; now it's a bug.\~ Until recently, it subjected less-free nations to the free speech of the most-free nations.\~
 New developments threaten to subject the most-free nations to the censorship rules of the least-free nations.\~ In the name of copyright enforcement, worldwide speech rights are sinking to the lowest standard in use anywhere.\line \line 
Another development in copyright law that harms scholarship is the extension of copyright terms, even retroactively.\~ The Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act (1998) retroactively added 20 years to existing copyrights.\~
 This harms scholarship by greatly delaying the transition of copyrighted works into the public domain.\~
 By shrinking the public domain, it shrinks the number of modern classics that volunteers can lawfully digitize and make freely available on the internet.\~ For the same reason, it tilts the balance of copyright law even further in the direction
 of publishers and against the interests of readers and researchers.\~ Those who have looked into it believe that the Bono Act was motivated to protect the Disney copyright on Mickey Mouse, which would have expired in 2003.\~
 If so, this is a grotesque inversion of values.\~ The Uruguay Round Agreements Act (1994) is even worse, and can remove works from the public domain and retroactively grant them copyrights.\~ \line \line 
In short, whatever harms the rights and interests of readers harms scholarship and research, and recent trends in copyright law increasingly favor the rights and interests of publishers over those of readers.\~
 Copyright law is increasingly hostile to fair-use rights, the first sale doctrine, limited terms, and the public domain.\~ \line \~\line Q. To summarize: 
is the Internet a boon or a bane as far as publishing and scholarly exchange are concerned? It would seem that its existence brought about the RETARDATION of users' rights - rather than the user empowerment everyone was hoping for.\line \~\line 
A. The Internet is an unprecedented boon to scholarly publishing.\~ The only problem is that we have barely begun to realize its full potential, including its potential to make scholarly literature freely available to everyone with an internet connection.
\~ We may never take full advantage of the ways it can transform scholarly research and publication.\~ That requires an endless approximation process, deep imagination, and time.\~
 But if we could just take advantage of the opportunity it affords for free online research literature, then the internet will have a greater beneficial impact on research and education than lending libraries or the Gutenberg press.

\par Michael S. Hart was a Professor of Electronic Text at {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Benedictine{\*\xmlclose} {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}University{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} ({\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Illinois{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}U.S.A.{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}) and a former Visiting Scientist at 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Carnegie{\*\xmlclose} {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Mellon{\*\xmlclose} {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}University{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 was a Fellow of the Internet Archive for the year 2000. He founded Project Gutenberg in 1971 and is currently its Executive Coordinator.
\par In more ways than one, he is the father of e-publishing and e-books. He pioneered not only the dissemination of electronic texts - but also some of the working models that underpinned the Internet until the dot.com crash two years ago. 
\par The ethos of the early Internet owes a lot to Hart. He created a mass movement of volunteers, remote-collaborating on a projec
t of free access to content. There is no better encapsulation of the gist of the Net. And PG books can be replicated at no cost - a precursor of viral and buzz marketing.
\par Project Gutenberg is, by now, an integral part of the myth and history of our network
ed world. It is a worldwide library created and maintained by a small army of dedicated volunteers who scan, proofread, and upload dozens of new e-texts every week. Most of these texts are in the public domain.
\par But a few are copyrighted - with permission to store the work granted by authors and publishers or other copyright holders. There are many imitators and copycats - but only one Project Gutenberg, in scope, perseverance, dedication, and thoroughness.

\par As copyright expires, thousands of works are added monthly to the public domain and can be freely replicated and distributed. Most of these books are out of print and saved by the Project from obscurity and ultimate oblivion. 
\par The recurrent extension of copyright terms by Congress hampers this work by rest
ricting the growth of the public domain or even by removing texts from it. It benefits very few copyright holders at the expense of universal access to literature and knowledge.
\par Hart mourns the rapidly dwindling public domain: 
\par "In the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
, no copyrights will expire from now to 2019!!! It is even much worse in many other countries, where they actually removed 20 years from the public domain. Books that had been legal to publish all of a sudden were not. Friends told me that in 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Italy{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, for example, all the great Italian operas that had entered the public domain are no longer there. . . 
\par Same goes for the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}United Kingdom{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Germany{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 increased their copyright term to more than 70 years back in the 1960's. It is a domino effect. {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Australia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 is the only country I know of that has officially stated they will not extend the copyright term by 20 years to more than 70."
\par Hart was a visionary and a pioneer. Such vocations carry a heav
y price tag in recurrent frustration and cumulative exhaustion. Hart may be tired, but he does not sound bitter. He is still a fount of brilliant ideas, thought provoking insights, exuberant optimism, and titillating predictions. 
\par Three decades of constant battle ended in partial victory - but Hart was as energetic as ever, straining at the next, seemingly implausible target. "A million books to a billion people in all corners of the globe."
\par Inevitably, he sometimes feels cornered. "They" figure in many of h
is statements - the cynical and avaricious establishment that will sacrifice anything to secure the diminishing returns of a few more copies sold. In the Project's life time, the period of copyright has been extended from an average of 30 years to an inan
e 95 years.
\par Moreover, no notice of renewal is required in order to enjoy the copyright extensions.
\par This protectionism hinders the spread of literacy, deprives the masses of much needed knowledge, discriminates against the poor, and, ultimately, undermines democracy - believes Hart.
\par Q. Project "Gutenberg" is a self-conscious name. In which ways is the Project comparable to Gutenberg's revolution?
\par A. When I chose the name, the major factor in mind was that publishing e-Books would change the map of literacy an
d education as much as did the Gutenberg Press which reduced the price of books to 1/400th their previous price tag. From the equivalent of the cost of an average family farm, books became so inexpensive that you could see a wagonload of them in the weeke
nd marketplace in small villages at prices that even these people could afford.
\par My second choice was Project Alexandria. The major difference is that the Alexandrians *collect* e-Books, while the Gutenbergers *produce* e-Books.
\par Another way our Project compares to Gutenberg's revolution is that copyright laws were created to stop both.
\par When we only had a dozen e-Books online, the price of putting one on a computer was about 1/400th the price of a paperback. But obviously with 100 gigabyte drives coming down t
o $100, the price of putting e-Books on computers has fallen so low as to be literally "too cheap to meter." Those who like to meter everything on the cash scale are incredibly upset about Project Gutenberg. 
\par Project Gutenberg is the first example of a "paradigm shift" from "Limited Distribution" to "Unlimited Distribution", now touted as "The Information Age". However, you should be aware that this is the 4th such Information Age. 
\par Each such phase has been stifled by making it illegal to use new technologies to copy texts. In 1710, the Statute of Anne copyright made it illegal for any but members of the ancient Stationers' Guild to use a Gutenberg Press. Then, in 1909, the 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}US{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} doubled the term of all copyrights to eliminate "reprint houses
" who were using the new steam and electric powered presses to compete with the old boy publishing network.
\par The third Information Age came in 1976 when the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}US{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} increased the copyright term to 75 years and eliminated the requirement to fil
e copyright renewals, to stifle changes brought on by Xerox machines. In 1998, the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}US{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 extended the copyright term yet again, to 95 years, to eliminate publication via the Internet.
\par Q. The concept of e-texts or e-books back in 1971 was novel. What made you think of this particular use for the $100 million in spare computer time you were given by the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
University{\*\xmlclose} of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Illinois{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}?
\par A. What allowed me to think of this particular use for computers so long before anyone else did is the same thing that allows every other inventor to create their inventions: being at the right place, at the right time, with the right background.
\par As Lermontov said in The Red Shoes: "Not even the greatest magician in the world can pull a rabbit out of a hat if there isn't already a rabbit in it."
\par I owe this background to my parents, and to my brother. I grew up in a house full of books and electronics, so the idea of combining the two was obvious
ly not as great a leap as it would have been for someone else. I repaired my Dad's hi-fi the first time when I was in the second grade, and was also the kid who adjusted everyone's TV and antennas when they were so new everyone was scared of them. 
\par I have always had a knack for electronics, and built and rebuilt radios and other electronics all my life, even though I never read an electronics book or manuals. . .it was just natural.
\par Let me tell you a story about how the Project started:
\par I happened to stop a
t our local IGA grocery store on the way. We were just coming up on the American Bicentennial and they put faux parchment historical documents in with the groceries. So, as I fumbled through my backpack for something to eat, I found the US Declaration of 
Independence and had a light bulb moment.
\par I thought for a while to see if I could figure out anything I could do with the computer that would be more important than typing in the Declaration of Independence, something that would still be there 100 years lat
er, but couldn't come up with anything, and so Project Gutenberg was born.
\par You have to remember that the Internet had just gone transcontinental and this was one of the very first computers on it. Somehow I had envisioned the Net in my mind very much as it would become 30 years later.
\par I envisioned sending the Declaration of Independence to everyone on the Net. . .all 100 of them. . .which would have crashed the whole thing, but luckily Fred Ranck stopped me, and we just posted a notice in what would later become comp.gen
\par I think about 6 out of the 100 users at the time downloaded it. . . .
\par Q. Between 1971 and 1993 you produced 100 e-texts. And then, in less than 9 years, an additional few thousand. What happened?
\par A. People rarely understand the power of doubling something every so often.
\par In 1991 we were doing one e-Book per month. This was totally revolutionary at the time. People kept predicting that we couldn't continue, but we were planning on doubling production every year, which we did for most years. We
 are now adding 200 e-texts a month.
\par Q. Can you give us some current download statistics?
\par A. As for stats, this is pretty much impossible since we don't directly control any but one or two of what I presume are hundreds of sites around the world that have 
our files up for download. What I can tell you is that the one site we have the most control of gives away over a million e-Books per month.
\par Q. The Internet is often castigated as an English-language, affluent people's toy. PG includes predominantly English language, Western world, texts. Do you intend to make it more multicultural and multilingual?
\par A. I encourage all languages as hard as I possibly can.
\par So far we have English, Latin, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Swedish, Danish, Welsh, Portuguese, Old Dutch, Bulgarian, Dutch/Flemish, Greek, Hebrew. We have texts in Old French, Polish, Russian, Romanian, and Farsi in progress.

\par I wonder if we should count mathematics as a language?
\par I was surprised at how many people were interested when we first uploaded Pi to a million places. . .
\par Q. Why are stand-alone images (e.g., films, photographs) and sound excluded or rare?
\par A. We have tried some, but haven't received much feedback. Still, we will continue to experiment with all formats.
\par Also, these files are total hogs for drives and bandwidth.
\par Our short movie of the lunar landing is twice as big as Shakespeare and the Bible combined in uncompressed format. It's only a couple minutes long, and low-resolution. Think how big a whole movie would be,
 even not at hi-resolution. It would take up a couple CD- ROMs. . . .
\par Q. PG now makes files available as DOC/RTF and HTML - as well as plain vanilla ASCII. Yet, plain text delivery seemed to have been a basic tenet of the Project. What made you change your mind?
\par A. We're willing to post in all kinds of file formats, but the only format everyone can read is Plain Vanilla ASCII, so we always try to include that. PG has been available on CDs for years.
\par Q. The failure of the advertising-sponsored revenue model 
forces Internet-based content generators and aggregators to charge for their wares. Will PG continue to be free - and, if so, how will it finance itself? Example: who is paying for the hosting and bandwidth now?
\par A. It's all volunteer. . . . And the number of sites continues to grow, and to reach more and more regions around the world for easier local access.
\par Actually, all the hosting, bandwidth, etc. are voluntary
, too. However, we desperately need donations to do copyright research, cataloging, to hire librarians and Library and Information Science professors, to support the Project Gutenberg spin-offs in other languages and countries, not to mention mundane thin
gs such as phone and utility bills, computers, drives, backups, etc. We need volunteers equally desperately. 
\par Volunteering is perhaps the only way for one person to work for a week or a month on a book and get it to a hundred million people. . . .
\par Q. The reaction to e-books fluctuates wildly between euphoria and gloom.
\par A. This is only the commercial point of view. . . They want to take it over or sink it to the bottom. . .There are no other commercial perspectives. Between 1500-1550, thanks to the Gutenberg 
Press, more books were printed than in all of history previous to Gutenberg. I have hopes like that for e-Books. . . .
\par Q. Some say that e-books are doomed, having miserably failed to capture the public's imagination and devotion. Others predict a future of ubiquitous, ATM-printed, e-books, replete with olfactory, tactile, audio, and 3-D effects. What is your scenario?

\par A. The main trouble with these predictions is not only that they are made solely with the commercial aspects in mind, but that they are made 
by an assortment of people from pre-e-Book generations, who have no idea that you could use the same gizmo to play MP3s as to read or listen to e-Books.
\par The younger generations have no doubt about e-Books.
\par It's only the dinosaurs that have no idea what's going on. We are still getting email stating that not one person is ever going to read books from computers!
\par Who will be the more well-read - those who can carry at most a dozen books with them, or those who have a PDA in their pocket with a hundred or more e-Books in it?
\par Who will look up more quotations in context? Who will use the dictionary more often? Who will look up geographical information more often?
\par These are all things I do with my little antique PDA and the new ones are already a dozen times more powerful.
\par I want to tell you the story of when I first realized that Project Gutenberg was going to work. It was about 10 years before we published our 2,000th E-text. We had only about a dozen e-books online. At the beginning of 1989 there were only 80,00
0 host computers in the entire Internet - though by October that year the number had doubled.
\par I was on the phone one day, with the Executive Director of Common Knowledge, a project to put the Library of Congress catalogs into public domain MARC (Machine Ac
cessible Record Catalog) records. During the conversation, there was this huge noise. She dropped the phone and ran off. She was back in a minute, and laughing her head off, she told me:
\par Her son had been playing around with her computer, and found this copy of Project Gutenberg's "{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Alice{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 in Wonderland" and had started to read it. He mentioned this at school, and a few of the kids followed him home to see it. The next day even more kids followed.  Eventually the number of kids grew so great that they were hanging off this huge oak chair.

\par Eventually this oak chair had so many kids all over it, reading "Alice in Wonderland"...that it literally separated into all its parts and kids went tumbling in all directions....At that very moment, in 1989, I realiz
ed that E-books were going to succeed, no matter what any of a number of adults thought. To the next generation, this will be how they remember {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Alice{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 in Wonderland, just as my memory of it was a golden inscribed red leather edition my family used to read from together.
\par Four years later, in 1993, there were still under 100 Project Gutenberg e-Books.
\par A neighbor dropped by to talk to me one day and in the course of the conversation mentioned he had read the Project Gutenberg Alice in Wonderland. I had
 no idea his interests even included computers. He had found a few errors. I hurried home to correct them and to put the new edition online. 
\par At first I was in happy shock just because I could improve our edition, but then it occurred to me that perhaps th
e more important aspect was that someone I knew had downloaded Alice all on his own, then read the entire book from "cover to cover" on his computer thus putting paid to the naysayers who said no one my age would read e-Books.
\par There are lots of stories like this: professors who tell me their students will not read paper textbooks, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Texas{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 preparing for all textbooks to be e-Books. . . .
\par Q. PG is a prime example of two phenomena characteristic to the early Internet: collaborative efforts and voluntee
ring. With the crass commercialization of the Net - will people continue to volunteer and collaborate - or will corporate, brick and mortar, behemoths take over?
\par A. Well, the commercialization of the Web started in 1994, and that didn't wipe us out. It too
k us 30 years to do our first 5,000 e-Books, and I'll bet you a pizza that it will only take 30 months to do our second 5,000!!! Then we write up a schedule for 1,000,000!!!!!!!
\par Q. In other words: PG is the reification of the spirit of the Internet.
\par A. Definitely. . .So was "Ask Dr. Internet", another of my personas. . .
\par Q. Should the Internet change dramatically - what will happen to PG? Will you ever consider going commercial, for instance? If not, how do you plan to adapt?
\par A. Why should we go commercial.
 . .that just invites a downfall if the money goes away. Which they would love to happen -and would probably encourage it. It's hard to kill off something that doesn't have a physical plant or a budget. . .and cannot be bought. We will adapt by doing the 
entire public domain, including graphics, music, movies, sculpture, paintings, photographs, etc. . . .
\par Q. PG makes obscure and inaccessible texts as well as seminal works - easily and globally available. Doesn't this lead to an embarrassment of riches or to
 confusion? In other words: all PG e-texts are "equal". It is a "democratic" system. There is no "text rating", historical context, peer review, quality control, censorship ...
\par A. This is because I am not a very bossy boss. . .I encourage our volunteers to choose their own favorites, not just what "I" think they should do. However, I am sure we will get all the warhorses done.
\par Q. The e-texts posted on PG are copyright free or with permission from their authors and publishers. How do you cope with the inordinately extended copyright period in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA
{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}?
\par A. I just finished up years of working on an Amicus Brief for the Supreme Court in the hope of overturning the latest copyright extensions. As for coping, you just do the best you can with the cards you are dealt.
\par Q. What are the effects of such legislation on public literacy?
\par A. The US used to say we would send aid to the entire world, in the form of food, clothing, medical supplies, as much as we could afford. But now that literacy can be disseminated at no expense, we refuse to do it by pretty much stifling the public domain
.
\par Q. PG has a mirror site in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Australia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} where copyright law is less stringent.
\par 
\par A. Actually, they are a totally separate organization, using our name with permission, just as does the Gutenberg Projekt-DE in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Germany{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}.
\par Q. Are such "backdoors" the solution? What about the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act)?
\par A. I am so a-political that you could call me anti-political. I would prefer a}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid96841\charrsid16322966  copyright of 10 years or so. . }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14568391\charrsid16322966 
\par Only the biggest of the best sellers might make 10% more after 10 years, and they don't need it.
\par Do we really want laws that support only the biggest and richest?
\par I love "The Bridges of Madison County", but I don't think 95 years, or even 75 years, or even 56 years of corporations, family and other heirs shou
ld be supported by it. It then becomes the "Duchy of Madison County" and we are stuck with generations of "Dukes of Madison County."
\par What we will end up with under these copyright laws is a "landed gentry of the information age" who just keep inheriting ...
\par Copyright should expire soon enough that the authors, if they want to keep getting paid, have to come back to work again.
\par After all, there is no other job in the world in which one piece of work can keep paying off for 95 years.
\par By the way, do you realize that Ted Turner made millions, probably hundreds of millions, from the copyright extension of just "Gone With The Wind", not counting the hundreds of other movies he owns. . .all from one vote of Congress. . . . .
\par Congress should not be allowed to write laws that create windfall profits for 1% of the population and take away a million books from all the rest.
\par Q. What does PG intend to do about the legislative asymmetry between content producers and creators - and content consumers? Lobby Congress? Testify? Protest? Organize petitions? Place "Gone with the Wind" on the Internet and wait for a show trial?
\par A. PG {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Australia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} already has done Gone With The Wind, as their 50th e-Book, that's good enough for me at the moment.
\par Eldred v. Ashcroft was originally drafted as Hart V. Reno, but the lawyers, Lessig & co, wouldn't include one word of mine in the case, so I fired them.
\par Q. Gutenberg texts are sometimes used as freebies within a commercial (Monolithic, Wallnut Creek) or semi-commercial product (such as the Public Domain Reader). Is this acceptable? Why don't you charge them a license fee?
\par A. Walnut Creek PG CD's weren't free and they sent us nice donations. The commercial outfits have to pay for a license, the non- commercial ones usually don'
t. Each case is separately decided. While we don't do any ads on our sites, we don't insist that others don't.
\par Q. Technology is often considered the antonym of "culture". TV, for instance, is berated for its vulgar, low-brow, programming. {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Hollywood{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 is often chastised for its indulgence in gratuitous violence and sex.
\par A. No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of their audience. As long as these are "commercial applications" that's what you will get. What else could you possibly expect? These are all examples of "capitalism gone awry".
\par By the way, I'm not anti-capitalism, I really am an Ayn Rand freak, figure that out. . .hee hee!
\par I am doing Project Gutenberg for the most selfish of reasons - because I want a world that has Project Gutenberg in it.
\par Q. E-books are equated with low-quality vanity publishing. Yet, PG seems to embody the conviction that technology can do wonders for the dissemination of culture, literacy, democracy, civil society and so on.
\par A. e-Books do wonders for the di
ssemination of culture, literacy, democracy, civil society and so on. You do realize that the Declaration of Independence is/was the FIRST man-made item in all of history that everyone can have, in as many copies as they want. Do you realize that a 5 giga
byte section of a hard drive can hold a million copies of that file, uncompressed?
\par Terabyte drive systems are already available for only around $2,500. Ten years from now 5T hard disk partitions will be able to hold a billion copies.
\par Q. Are you a romantic believer in the power of technology to bring progress?
\par A. Well, I'm certainly an incurable romantic, and I believe that technology can bring progress, but I don't know if they are, or have to be, related. . . .
\par Q. And do you see any dangers in e-books and freely available e-texts (e.g., hate speech)?
\par A. Once you start censoring, you are playing with Pandora's Box. Just look at what they are doing with Little Black Sambo, who wasn't even black, and with Uncle Remu
s, who was? This is awful. "Song of the South" was required viewing when I was in school and now I can't even show this generation what we were required to study when I was a kid. . .1984 really did arrive. . . .
\par Q. In some ways, you "compete" directly with other bastions of education - libraries and universities. How do you get along? What about other repositories of knowledge such as Project Bartleby? Governments?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\insrsid13395941\charrsid16322966 
\par \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14568391\charrsid16322966 
\par A. Actually, we cooperate with them, not compete with them. We make all our files availabl
e to them and encourage them to make the texts available to everyone. Some of them view this as competition, but we don't. Some prefer to control distribution. . .to be a gate that they can open and close at will. . .We prefer the doors always to be open.

\par Have you ever considered why, with the hundred millions of dollars granted to found e-Libraries at the major universities some ten years ago, and undoubtedly hundreds of millions more donated since then, why you are doing an interview with someone sitting
 at a basement, running computer hardware and software that is 10 and 20 years old?
\par If any college, or company, much less university, city, county, state or country was willing to do this, you would have never heard of me.
\par Q. What has been the personal cost? It must have been frustrating and exhausting and elating and rewarding ... In retrospect: are you happy with it? Would you have done it again?
\par A. I can't think of anything more rewarding to do as a career than Project Gutenberg. It is something that will
 reach more people than any other project in all of history. It is as powerful as The Bomb, but everyone can benefit from it. And it doesn't make a decent weapon. It doesn't cost anyone anything and it is the very first, though obviously primitive, exampl
e of The Neo-Industrial Revolution, when everyone can have everything - though they are sure to pass a law against it.
\par I said this in 1971, in the very first week of PG, that by the end of my lifetime you would be able to carry every word in the Library of 
Congress in one hand - but they will pass a law against it. I realized they would never let us have that much access to so much information. I never heard that they passed the copyright extension 5 years later. It was pretty much a secret, just as is the 
current one, unless the Supreme Court strikes it down. Only then will it make the news.
\par Congress passed that copyright law together with impeachment proceedings of President Clinton, just to make sure it never made the news.
\par As far as the cost, the happines
s, the frustration - I am a natural born workaholic and idealist, so I overcome the technical frustrations. It's the social frustrations that are the hardest to deal with, the people who want permanent copyright, even though the extensions are already bri
nging about "The Landed Gentry of the Information Age."
\par Q. Any thought about the future?
\par Precedents set by the Sonny Bono Copyright Law could well have an enormous unpredicted effect on computer applications of the future. One such application is the "print
ing" of solid three dimensional objects, often referred to as Rapid Prototyping, or RP. These printers have been with us since the 1980's and now are in a price range of the 5 megabyte hard drives on the first computer to house Project Gutenberg in 1971. 
If you count the inflation factor, they obviously are much more affordable.
\par In addition to cost reductions, these 3-D printers now can print on a variety of materials. The list of printable substances should expand over the years until we can eventually print out actual working items, rather than the models we print out today.

\par Given that very inexpensive printers today can print in millions of colors, and that color computer printers were pretty much non-existent 30 years ago, we should at least consider the
 possibility that printers 30 years from now might be able to "print" on an extremely wide variety of materials, and that someday we will be able to "print out" a car and drive it away.
\par This copyright law covers 95 years. Let's look back to 95 years and see the "copyright" to what things we may want to print out would have just now expired:
\par 1. The Wright-Brothers' airplane and blueprints.
\par {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}2. A dozen{\*\xmlclose} brands of early automobiles.
\par 3. Everything {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Edison{\*\xmlclose} invented until he was nearly 60.
\par Obviously there are many more.
\par The point here is that under current intellectual property law, it would be difficult to print out anything invented today that reached the market in two years - until 2100, a time when these items would no longer have any use.
\par When the Star Trek Replicators become a reality, will it be illegal to actually use them?
\par Will all food items be Genetically Manipulated Organisms so that it will be impossible to find natural foods that could be copied?
\par When I grew up in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Washington{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 state, there were plenty of wild blackberries, raspberries, apple trees, pear trees, plum trees, grapes. I never even considered buying any of these at a store. But today there has been a serious effort to discourage free food supplies, and not only in 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Washington{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, but also in most other states.
\par Last night at dinner, one of our volunteers remarked that he expected that by the end of his lifetime he might be eating a dinner of replicated food. I pointed out that by that time - "they" would make 
it very difficult to find any kind of food not protected against replication by intellectual property laws and that THAT was one of the major reasons for extending copyright, so that WHEN it would be possible for everyone to be well-read & well-fed, they 
will have made it illegal to do so.
\par The trend is that everything should cost something. In some places there are even machines that dispense a breath of fresh air. . .for a price.
\par Do we really want to create a civilization in which everything has a price. . .when there are machines that could copy anything?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966

\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966  Why electronic publishing? 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 A.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966  I was first introduced to electronic publishing on the Internet in the late 1980s and became intrigued by the powe
r of this revolutionary development. Then, when Mosaic released the first Web browser in 1992, the Internet finally had a visual aspect.\~
Suddenly, the vast Internet was transformed from a dimly lit warehouse for data storage and exchange, to a visible library and gallery for information.\~I was hooked.\line \line In 1994, while teaching at a university in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname 
City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Japan{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, I created what was probably one of the first (if not the first) paperless reading classes.\~I taught myself HTML and built 26 Web-based read
ing lessons for the "comparative cultures" course I taught there.\~The reading material in each lesson linked to related websites and information.\~
Instructions were included for the exercises, which usually included finding information or doing research somewhere on the Web.\~Students emailed their results to me, and I emailed feedback and grades to them.\~
Students were not required to come to class, but were required to turn in their "class work" results to me by Friday evening.\line \line Since then, I have created nu
merous Web sites, published a number of electronic & print books, and hundreds of articles.\~In the late 1990's I saw the confluence of three factors that foretold the electronic publishing and e-book revolution.\~
The first was the imminent ubiquity of the Internet. Next, was the growing need for mobile access to information, and the availability of so much data in the digital domain.\~ 
\par Finally, I could see the day when technology would catch up with my vision of a portable information tablet.\~As of summer 20
02, I am still waiting, but technological developments are rapidly nearing the time, probably somewhere around 2005, when affordable, portable, readable, wireless reading devices will reach the mass markets.\~
The company where I work, Rolltronics Corporation, is developing thin, flexible electronics technology that will enable many of these devices in the future.\line \line While living in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname 
City}}Japan{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and working at Fujitsu, Inc., I founded eBookNet and began toying with the design of a next-generation in
formation display device. In 1998, I founded eBookNet.com, which became a renowned Web site that provided news and community services for the e-book and e-publishing industry for several years.\line \line 
In 1999, NuvoMedia (the company that pioneered the current generation of electronic reading devices with its "Rocket eBook" in 1998) acquired eBookNet and hired me.\~NuvoMedia supported eBookNet until April 2001.\line \line 
A few months later, with the support of the Rolltronics Foundation, Wade Roush (former managing editor o
f eBookNet) and I founded the Electronic Publishing Resource Center (EPRC), an industry-sponsored, non-profit organization, and launched eBookWeb.org on {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}the 4th of July 2001{\*\xmlclose}.\~
\par I see myself as an e-book evangelist, seeking to inform an
d educate the world about electronic publishing. My vision is of a world where information, entertainment, and books are readily available to professionals, researchers, students, and readers everywhere.\~
So, even though I work full time for Rolltronics doing business development, I continue my daily efforts to help build the e-Book industry through eBookWeb.org.\~
 The Website now leads in providing news, information, resources, and community services to the e-media industries.\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 Q.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 
 This has been a bad year for e-publishing. Leading brands vanished, industry leaders retreated, technology gurus bemoaned yet another missed prognosis - that e-books will dethrone print books. What went wrong?\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch 
\b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 A.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966  Ever since I first realized the need for portable information devices
, my belief in the future of e-books has never been shaken. Despite the fact that e-book reality replaced hype in 2000, and 2001 brought a temporary cyclical economic downturn, I firmly believe and know that e-books and e-publishing, or more generally por
table information devices, will play a primary role in the way that people write, create, design, read, learn, access news and information, communicate, interact, travel, enjoy art and entertainment, and experience their world.\line \line 
It is just taking longer to get there than many had hoped around the turn of the century. There are still several factors that need to come together to make e-books a reality.\~The hardware is still not there.\~
We need affordable, light, thin, readable displays with battery life measured in days or weeks, not hours.\~To be truly useful and portable, the devices need to be wireless and perhaps with a backup cellular connection for remote locales.\~
Next, there needs to be much more content available for distribution to these devices. Secure but accessible infrastructure and standards need to be in place for mass-market appeal.\~
Then, adoption by libraries and educational institutions will spread the use of e-books at the grassroots level.\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 Q.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 
 Questions of device compatibility and standards have plagued the industry from its inception. Will we end up with an oligopoly of 2-3 formats and 2-3 corresponding readers, or do you have a different take on the industry's future?\line \line }{\rtlch 
\ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 A.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966  We may be destined to have several formats and platforms, each of which is used for certain applications and types of content.\~
The reason is that there are basically four major players, each with their own plan to dominate the e-Publishing market.\line \line Despite the fact that, in my opinion, Adobe's PDF is lacking as an e-Book form
at, there are hundreds of millions of documents in PDF in publishing companies, governments, corporations, and schools.\~These will not be replaced instantly, even if a unified format were agreed upon.\line \line 
Then there is Microsoft, the 800-pound gorilla, who is slowly and silently insinuating their reading platform into their software and Windows operating system.\~
The interoperability of MS Reader software with MS Office products will make it possible for many millions of documents to be converted to MS Reader format.\~ 
\par Of course, there will need to be a portable device to display all those e-documents.\~Despite the fact that many Pocket PCs have been sold, they don't seem to be a major factor in e-content sales.\~Now the timing of Microsoft's big push for the MS t
ablet PC begins to make more sense.\line \line The Gemstar format has an established base of customers and actual dedicated devices, the Rocket eBook and REB1100 and REB1200s.\~
Gemstar's format actually has a lot of popular content going for it, and their displays are much better than the average computer display.\~Therefore they are more suitable for portable reading.\line \line 
And not surprisingly, the largest sales of electronic content are going to the Palm Pilot compatible devices.\~The established base of many millions of 
"Palm OS" customers has been buying hundreds of thousands of e-books each year, and the e-content sales are growing steadily.\line \line How to unify these four goliaths?\~
The Open eBook Forum's standard is good for the formatting of the original document.\~ Microsoft and Gemstar adhere to the OeBF standard.\~But each company has its own way of converting and displaying the OeBF format in its device or software.\~
 So what is the answer?\~The only way to rectify all of these heavyweight solutions is to create a unified standard for displaying electronic content that is the same across all platforms.\~Is this possible?\~
That is a question better answered by the experts at the OeBF...\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 Q.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 
 Some analysts blame the recent bloodbath on a dearth of good content and wrong pricing. They derisively equate e-publishing with vanity publishing. Do you find these criticisms correct?\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch 
\b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 A.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966  The amount of content is growing slowly but steadily.\~ There are two major problems that contribute to the relative dearth of titles becoming available.\~One
 is that extra negotiations and agreements are necessary to publish e-books, or to price them differently from "p-books."\~
Another is that since the market still isn't there, many publishers do not have the resources, or haven't budgeted enough money to aggressively convert content.\~
And many veteran publishers still produce the final version of a book in a format that is not easy to convert for electronic publication.\line \line As far as vanity publishing goes, that is not defined by the medium.\~Of course electronic 
publishing makes it easier to distribute "vanity-published" works.\~And it is easier to become self-published.\~And there are a few vanity publishers out there, but they usually don't last long.\~
Still, most publishers and electronic publishers strive to produce top quality titles.\~ They know that this is the only long-term viable business model.\~They screen and edit the titles that they publish.\~They actively promote their authors' works.\~
In this sense, a publisher's name brand will become much more important to customers than is presently the case.\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 Q.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 
 Traditional print publishers treat e-books (the content, not the devices) as electronic facsimiles of the print editions. Can e-books offer a different reading experience? In what way are they different to print books?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

 E-books that are nothing more than electronic copies of the print version offer only portability and access as advantages.\~\~Of course e-books can be searched and annotated.\~ The vision impaired can read with large fonts.\~Students can look up
 words in a built-in dictionary.\line \line But, similar to popular movie DVDs that include many extras, e-books should really take advantage of the flexibility and capacity of the electronic medium.\~
Publishers could include the author's notes, rough sketches, background, audio or video from the author or the scene of the books. Reference works should be electronically updateable via the Internet.\~
Book club members might be able to send each other their annotations and comments. Readers might send feedback to the author and/or publisher.\~Fans might write and distribute alternate endings, or add characters or scenes.\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\af0 
\ltrch \b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 Q.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966  E-publishing is at the nexus of sea changes in copyright laws. Does e-publishing encourage piracy? Have publishers gone overboard in an effort to pres
erve their intellectual property rights? Do you foresee new models of revenues and royalties and a novel definition of intellectual property?\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 A.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966  E-publishing does not encourage piracy, but being in electronic format, it certainly becomes susceptible to the same kind of piracy that all other kinds of e-content experience.\~
A number of models, or rather experiments, are being tried with respect to the level of control of intellectual property and the associated financial model.\~So far, there has not been a clear answer as to which experiment yields the best results.\~

\par One factor is that the market is still in its infancy and therefore is in a state of flux.\~The continuum runs from strict and limited control offered by digital rights management systems, to free 
e-content (hopefully) supported by either stimulating sales of print books, or advertisements.\~In the middle are publishers who provide limited security, or those who use no security and depend on the basic honesty of most people.\~
As the market grows, we will discover which models work best in which situations for which types of content.\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 Q.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 
 E-books were supposed to bring about disintermediation and foster a direct dialog between author and readership. Have they succeeded? What is the future of content brokers, such as publishers and record companies?\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch 
\b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 A.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966  Yes, there is an enhanced dialog between author and audience.\~On eBookWeb.org, we provide space for authors to have a personal page.\~
These are some of the most popular pages on the site.\~On other Websites and through the publications themselves, authors are coming in closer digital contact with their readers through email or other forms of dialog.\~
For low volumes of messages, this is a good thing. But top-selling writers could not handle email from thousands of dedicated fans.\~
 Even in an electronic world, it is still true that as one becomes more popular, one has to become less and less accessible in order to conserve one's time.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid13395941\charrsid16322966 
\par \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 \line \line Yes, it is also much easier to become self-published electronically.\~However
, there is usually a huge difference between simply being published, and actually reaching a large audience and reaping significant sales of your title.\~The Web continues to grow exponentially, but our time and attention span remain limited.\~
These two opposing dynamics mean that we are forced to narrow our attention to a relatively few reliable content providers, representing an ever smaller proportion of the total content available.\line \line How can an author be heard above the noise?\~
Get a publisher who will promote your work.\~But before that, get an editor or publisher who will help you polish your work until it shines brightly enough to gain popularity once it secures the attention of your audience.\~
The dynamics and demands of the free market, and the reasons for having publishing companies do not disappear on the Internet.\~In fact, they may become more important as the amount of content and choices continues to grow.\line \line 
One important change that I do foresee is that small, independent niche publishers will make a resurgence due to the electronic medium.\~This is definitely a good thing for readers.\~
Independent publishers who build a reputation for unique, quality content, will develop a following of faithful customers over time.\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 Q.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966  Some marketing pundits believe in viral or buzz marketing. They advocate giving away free content to generate "buzz". They believe that sales will follow. Do you subscribe to this view?\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch 
\b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 A.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966  This relates to the question of copyright laws and which model is best for a particular situation.\~It also has to do with previous models on the Web.\~
If the goal is to gain an audience and fame, then giving it away to hopefully millions of people is a good idea.\~The popular dynamic of the Internet is to build a massive audience by giving away something of value.\~
 Then, one slowly begins to charge for some content or service, while still providing something for free, to continue to attract a large following.\line \line The results of the late 1990s indicate a mixed success, probably due in part to the origins of t
he Internet, where everything was free.\~The expectation was that if it was on the Net, it was free.\~
The beginnings of commercialism on the Net in the early 1990's were met with vehement resistance from the "old timers" who strongly opposed the commercializa
tion of their beloved network. Of course, a number of companies such as eBay, Amazon, and Yahoo, attracted and kept a large audience.\~But only a few are truly profitable today.\line \line 
If the goal is to make maximum profit from each unit of content that is downloaded, then one must charge money, or sell advertisements. Unfortunately, the revenues from advertising on the Net have fallen dramatically in the last few years.\~
So if you put a price tag on your content, how much should you charge?\~ Most independent electronic publishers charge a few dollars for their titles, anywhere from $1 each to about $5 or $7 per e-book.\~
These relatively low prices reflect the desire to attract a large pool of customers.\~They also reflect the belief common among readers that since it is electronic and not print content, the price should be lower.\~
They feel that without the cost of printing and transporting books, the publisher should set a lower price...\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 Q.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 
 As you see it, is the Internet merely another content distribution channel or
 is there more to it then this? The hype of synergy and collapsing barriers to entry has largely evaporated together with the fortunes of the likes of AOL Time Warner. Is the Internet a revolution - or barely an evolution?\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\af0 
\ltrch \b\insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966 A.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid3561012\charrsid16322966  In the beginning, the Internet was a revolution.\~Email brought the people of our Earth closer together.\~
The Net enabled telecommuting and now as much as 10% of the world works at home via computer and Internet.\~The Internet makes it possible for artists to publish their own books, music, videos and Websites.\~
Video conferencing has enabled conversations without limitations of space.\~The Internet has made vast amounts of information available to students and researchers at the click of the mouse.\~The 24/7 access and ease of ordering prod
ucts has stimulated online commerce and sales at retail stores.\line \line But it is not a cure-all.\~And, now that the Net is part of our everyday lives, it is subject to the same cycles of media hype, as well as social, emotional, and business factors.
\~Things will never be the same, and the changes have just begun.\~The present generation has never known a world without computers.\~
 When they reach working age, they will be much more inclined to use the Net for a majority of their reading and entertainment needs.\~Then, e-books will truly take hold and become ubiquitous.\~
Between now and then, we have work to do, building the foundation of this remarkable industry.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid7028782\charrsid16322966

\par Based on the recommendation of its Patent Office and following fierce lobbying by VG Wort, an association of German composers, authors and pu
blishers, Germany is poised to enforce a three years old law and impose a copyright levy of $13 plus 16 percent in value added tax per new computer sold in the country. 
\par The money will be used to reimburse copyright holders - artists, performers, recording companies, publishers and movie studios - for unauthorized copying thought to adversely weigh on sales.
\par This is the nonbinding outcome of a one year mediation effort by the Patent Office between VG Wort, Fujitsu Siemens Computers, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Germany{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
's largest computer manufacturer and other makers. VG Wort initially sought a levy of $33 per unit sold. 
\par But Fujitsu and the German Association for Information Technology, Telecommunications and New Media (Bitkom) - including Microsoft, IBM, Alcatel, Nokia, Siemens and 1300 other member firms -}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf18\insrsid7028782\charrsid16322966  }{
\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid7028782\charrsid16322966 intend to challenge even the more modest fee in court. 
\par They claim that it will add close to $80 million to the cost of purchas
ing computers without conferring real benefits on the levy's intended beneficiaries. They repeated similar assertions in a letter they have recently dispatched to the European Commission.
\par The problems of peer-to-peer file sharing, file swapping, the cracking and hacking of software, music and, lately, even e-books - are serious. {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Bundesverband Phono}{\rtlch \af0

's recording industry trade association, reported that music sales plunged for the fifth consecutive year - this time, by more than by 11 percent. 
\par According to figures offered by the, admittedly biased, group, 55 percent of the 486 million blank CDs sold in Germany last year - c. 267 million - were used for illicit purposes. For every "legal" music CD sold - there are 1.7 "illegal" ones.
\par Efforts by the industries effected are underway to extend the levy to computer peripherals and, where not yet implemented, photocopying machines. Similar charges are applied today by many European countries to other types of equipment: tape recorders
, photocopiers, video-cassettes and scanners, for instance. Blank magnetic and optical media, especially recordable CDs, are\~ - or were - taxed in more than 40 countries, including {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname 
City}}Canada{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}United States{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}.
\par Nor is {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Germany{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} alone in this attempt to ameliorate the pernicious effects of piracy by taxing the hardware used to affect it. 
\par The European Union's Directive on the Harmonisation of Certain Aspects of Copyright and Related Rights in the Informa
tion Society, passed in 2001, is strenuous, though not prescriptive. It demands that member states ensure "fair compensation" to copyright holders for copies made by means of digital equipment - but fails to specify or proscribe how. It has been incorpora
ted into local law only by {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Greece{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Denmark{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 hitherto.
\par In {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Austria{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, Literar-Mechana, the copyright fees collection agency, negotiated with hardware manufacturers and importers the introduction of a le
vy on personal computers and printers. The Swiss are pushing through an amendment to the copyright law to collect a levy on PCs sold within their territory. The Belgian, Finnish, Spanish and French authorities are still debating the issue. So do Luxemburg
 and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Norway{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. 
\par According to Wired, the Canadian Private Copying Collective, the music industry trade group, has proposed "new levies to be applied to any device that can store music, such as removable hard drives, recordable DVDs, Compact

\par Precedent is hardly encouraging. 
\par The aforementioned Canadian Collective has yet to distribute to its members even one tax dollar of the tens of millions it inexplicably hoards. In {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Greece{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
, a 2 percent levy on all manner of computer equipment provoked a hail of legal challenges, still to be sorted out in the courts. The amounts collected hardly cover the government's legal expenses hitherto. 
\par The {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}United Kingdom{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Ireland{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1

 are against the levy, claiming, correctly, that hardware is used for purposes other than pilfering intellectual property digitally. The Italians, Portuguese and Dutch haven't even considered the option. 
\par \page Hardware manufacturers are livid. In a buyers' market, their razor-thin profit margins on the commoditized goods they are peddling are bound to be erased by a copyright levy. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cs25\insrsid7028782\charrsid16322966 
The European Information and Communications Trade Association (EICTA)
 implausibly threatens to pass on such extra costs to consumers and recommends to stick to technological means of prevention, collectively known as Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems, or to novel CD copy protection measures.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\insrsid7028782\charrsid16322966 
\par Moreover, the fuzzy nature of the surcharge leaves a lot to be desired. Peter Suber, a prominent advocate of free online scholarship, analyzed the various post-levy scenarios in his FOS blog:
\par "What I can't tell is whether the copyright levy on hardware will come with universal perm
ission to copy. If so, that's a big gain for a small cost ... If the levy does not imply permission to copy, then which copying does it cover? If it covers copying without prior permission, then users will simply stop asking for permission, and convert al
l copying to pre-paid copying. If it covers copying without pre-payment, then that begs the question: what does the levy pre-pay? (It's not clear) how the plan would continue to distinguish authorized from unauthorized copying."
\par Yet, at this stage, it is difficult to see how to avoid the kind of rough justice meted out by {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Germany{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
. Even the most advanced DRM systems lack a reliable model of remunerating copyright holders. Hence the conspicuous absence of DRM in the EU's Copyright Directive. 
\par Suber raises some practical concerns, though he broadly supports a copyright levy on hardware:
\par "To make the system fair, we would need reasonably accurate measurements of the amount of copying. Otherwise we wouldn't know whether to bump up the price of a
 computer $35 or $350 or whether to give Elsevier 1% or 10%. Download counters wouldn't catch the peer-to-peer traffic. So would you put up with packet sniffers or other eavesdropping technologies to take random samples of the copy traffic, as long as you
r identity was not recorded?"
\par Even what constitutes copyrighted work is not entirely clear. The European Court of Justice heard arguments last week in a case pitting two American companies, IMS Health and NDCHealth, against each other. IMS Health vends aggr
egated German data pertaining to the sales of pharmaceuticals. 
\par NDCHealth tried to emulate an organizational element of the IMS Health database. The Court is faced with seemingly intractable questions: Can IMS Health be compelled to license its database to
 a potential competitor? Is the structure of the database - the way {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Germany{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} is divided to 1860 reporting zones - protected in any way?
\par In essence, copyright is a temporary monopoly on creative work granted to the authors, publishers and 
distributors of such products. It is intended to compensate them for their efforts and to encourage them to continue to originate in future. Yet, the disintermediation brought on by digital technologies threatens to link author and public directly, cuttin
g out traditional content brokers such as record companies or publishers. 
\par This is the crux of the battle royal. The middlemen are attempting - in vain - to sustain their dying and increasingly parasitic industries and refusing to adapt and re-invent themse
lves. Everyone else watches in amazement and dismay the consequences of this grand folly: innovation is thwarted, consumers penalized, access to works of art, literature and research constrained.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid16322966

\par These are momentous times i
n the digital content industry. Within the past 60 days, Barnes and Noble withdrew from the e-books business, peddling its electronic publishing house to iUniverse and terminating the sale of digital titles from its barnesandnoble.com Web site. It then pr
oceeded to take private its publicly listed online arm. 
\par To the consternation of many authors, Amazon, its chief Internet competitor, introduced a "search inside the book" feature with an initial database of 120,000 titles. It was preceded by eBooks.com's less comprehensive but otherwise similar search engine.

\par Project Gutenberg - the pioneering and largest depository of free, mostly "plain-vanilla" (text only) e-books - added the 10,000-th title to its unsurpassed collection. In the meantime, e-book aggregat
ors, such as blackmask.com, now proffer tens of thousands of free titles for download in up to 8 file formats. Even Microsoft has spent the last few months offering a free weekly selection of 3 commercial titles each, exclusively readable on its MS-Reader
 application.
\par Buffeted by these winds of e-commerce, vendors of online reference - textbooks, dictionaries, and encyclopedias - are eyeing the market warily and wearily. 
\par Patrick Spain is Chairman and CEO of Alacritude, publisher of eLibrary and Encyclopedi
a.com. eLibrary is a digital archive of more than 13 million documents culled from over 2000 publications. It includes newswires, newspapers, magazines, journals, transcripts, photographs, maps and books - major works of literature, art, and reference.

 ever since. Questia is a massive online library of over 400,000 books, journals, and articles organized into more than 4000 research topics. It caters mainly to students and offers co
ol features such as online annotation, page printing for free, and bibliography generator.
\par Tom Panelas is the Director of Corporate Communications of the Encyclopaedia Britannica - the Rolls Royce of reference works. It has been available online for a few 
years now - the 32 volumes, an interactive atlas, a student's version, a links directory, and a topical compilation of thousands of magazine articles and multimedia. The Britannica has alternated between revenue models: subscriptions only, then free acces

 That which used to be delivered to a limited audience of thousands (librarians and large companies) is now available to a huge audience in the tens, maybe hundreds, of millions. This affects prices, business models, and the very struct
ure of the industry.\~ Many generic reference materials (encyclopedias, dictionaries, thesauri, etc.) are available for free and will remain so for the indefinite future.\~
They serve either to market print and other electronic products or they generate advertising.\~Good models do both.\~Some very specialized titles with limited audiences may continue to be able to charge.\~But most cannot.\~
This means that people won't pay or won't pay much for "content" - but they will pay small amounts for services that help t
hem find, organize and publish answers to their questions especially when those relate to wealth (finance and career), health, and certain types of entertainment.

 There are a number of discernible trends: first, electronic access will be the primary method of accessing scholarly information within a decade or two.\~

Questia's and netLibrary's collections are very different.\~ The Questia collection was developed specifically for undergraduate research in the humanities and social sciences. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1\insrsid16322966\charrsid8732692 
A staff of academic librarians determined which books are most important and useful for undergraduate coursework in these fields.\~Digital copyrights were negotiated with the publishers or author of the titles.\~
Many publishers feared e-books and digital copies of their titles would cannibalize their hard copy print sales.\~Making them understand the benefits of placing their titles in the Questia online library was an education process.\~ }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\insrsid16322966\charrsid8732692

 The resultant book collection contains the complete text and original pagination of more than 45,000 books }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1\insrsid16322966\charrsid8732692 from the 19th through the 21st centuries.\~
Our goal is to build a collection that includes important works from all time periods and provides our users with a full range of resources just as any quality library does.\~We want to build a true res
earch collection, not just a compilation of recent publications.\~The entire Questia collection has more than 400,000 titles \endash  including 360,000 journal, magazine, and newspaper articles.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid16322966\charrsid8732692

\par }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1\insrsid16322966\charrsid8732692 In contrast, the 37,000-title netLibrary collection was developed by incorporating books that were already available in electronic formats.\~
As a result, it lacks many important retrospective titles.\~Additionally, netLibrary was developed with the view of selling individual titles.\~Consequently, although it has titles in a broader range of subjects than Questia, it was not developed as a 
\'93collection.\'94\~Questia specifically excludes titles in the natural sciences, technical and medical fields.\~We have a strong focus on \'93collection development\'94 so that we can support rigorous 
academic research in thousands of social science and humanities specific topic areas. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid16322966\charrsid8732692 
\par \~
\par A second important point of difference is the business model.\~Questia's is direct to the consumer.\~Individuals purchase subscriptions.\~We do not sell institutional site licenses to colleges or universities.\~
NetLibrary sells to institutions. Public, private, and academic libraries, or consortia thereof, buy specific titles that it vends, similar to the way they purchase print copies.\~ 
\par \~
\par Third, with Questia, there is no limit on the number of simultaneous users for any given book or article. No book is ever checked out or unavailable to a subscriber.\~
With NetLibrary, the number of users is restricted to the number of electronic copies of a book purchased by a library.\~ 
\par \~
\par The advantage of netLibrary is that it significantly reduces the costs of owning and maintaining books, i.e. the overhead associated with shelf-space such as lighting, the costs of checking books in and out manually, reshelving them, rebinding them, lost 
and misplaced copies, etc.\~\~ 
\par \~
\par Lastly, the research environment is very different.\~Questia provides a set of tools that enable a user to do better research and organize their work - to highlight, jot down notes or bookmark a page, look up items in a dicti
onary, encyclopedia, and thesaurus, and create properly formatted citations and bibliographies in MLA, APA, ASA, Chicago, and Turabian styles.\~ All these can be filed in a user\rquote 
s customizable personal workspace, which is akin to an online filing cabinet.\~Users can create multiple project folders to organize their research, \'93shelve\'94 frequently accessed books or articles, and refer back to their bookshelf at any time.

\par \~
\par NetLibrary offers four dictionaries as a reference tool but does not provide the type of customizable personal research environment that Questia does.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1\insrsid16322966\charrsid8732692  }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

Prices of electronic encyclopedias are lower than print, but the value proposition of print is different, and people who continue to buy print do so because they like it.\~

 compensates in breadth and depth and recently emergent subject portals (directories such as Google, Yahoo! or The Open Directory) have become the indices of the Internet. The aforementioned anti-competition barriers to entry are gone: web publishing is c

eap and immediate. Technologies such as web communities, chat, and e-mail enable massive collaborative efforts. And, most important, the bulk of the Internet is free. Users pay only the communication costs. The long-heralded transition from free content t
o
 fee-based information may revive the fortunes of online reference vendors. But as long as the Internet - with its 2,000,000,000 visible pages (and 5 times as many pages in its databases) - is free, encyclopedias have little by way of a competitive advant

I agree. Still, Open Directories and free powerful search engines (which, let's remember, make their money by trying to sell you goods and services relating to the keywords used in your search) only constitute 5% (or less) of what amounts to "research."\~
First you have to find it; we have made good progress here.\~Then you have to organize it; there are few good tools for this.\~Finally you have to publish it, likely using one of Microsoft's applications.\~
This entire process from search results to answers delivered in publishable form remains painful and time consuming.\~The opportunity lies in making research as easy as search.\~It seems simple, but it's very hard.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10950763

There is certainly a lot of information on the Internet and that is a wonderful thing.\~ However, there is virtually no place an individual who is not part of a major college or university can go online and find the
 full-text of books, including contemporary and recent ones.\~To say that the information that is available online is equivalent to the information stored in the Library of Congress is absurd.\~I\rquote 
m not talking only about the range of information but also about the value of the editorial process.\~
There is clearly a huge difference between someone posting something on a website and someone rigorously researching a book for five or ten years and then submitting it to peer review and the careful attention of editors.\~
Virtually none of the fruits of this serious research and editorial process is available on the Web.\~The material on the Net suffers from a chronic issue of questionable credibility and is ephemeral.\~The material published by leading publishers is rel

\insrsid16322966\charrsid8732692 It simply isn't true that the Internet is an encyclopedia.\~It's an aggregation of information by anyone who wants to put it up there.\~An encyclopedia is the product of a unified idea, a single editorial intelligen

This amounts to an impenetrable smokescreen: identities can rarely be established and evading the legal consequences of one's actions or omissions is easy. As the exposure of the confabulated professional biography of Wikipedia Arbitrator Essjay in March

nt) a member is; the more prone to flame, bully, and harass; the more inclined to form coalitions with like-minded trolls; the less of a life he or she has outside the Wikipedia, the more they are likely to end up being administrators.}{\rtlch \af0

 editing. Many entries are completely re-written (not to say vandalized) with the arrival of new kids on the Wikipedia block. Contrary to advertently-fostered impressions, the Wikipedia is not a cumulative process. Its text goes through dizzyingly rapid a

 mention the Wikimedia's full-time staff, fuelled by 2 million US dollars in public donations). These senior editors regularly interfere in the contents of articles. They do so often without any rhyme or reason and on a whim (hence the anarchy) - but edit

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
A recent (late 2006) study by Heather Hopkins from Hitwise demonstrates the existence of a pernicious feedback loop between Google, Wikipedia, MySpace, and Blogspot. Wikipedia gets 54% of its traffic from Google search results. The majority of Wikipedia v
isitors then proceed to MySpace or Blogspot, both of which use Google as their search service and serve Google-generated advertisements.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Google has changed its search algorithm in late 2005-early 2006. I have been monitoring 154 keywords on Google since 199
9. Of these, the number one (#1) search result in 128 keywords is now a Wikipedia article. More than a quarter (38 out of 128) of these "articles" are what the Wikipedia calls "stubs" (one or two sentences to be expanded by Wikipedians in the future). Bet
ween 7 and 10 of the articles that made it to the much-coveted number one spot are ... empty pages, placeholders, yet to be written!}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This is Google's policy now: Wikipedia articles regardless of their length or quality or even mere existence are placed by G
oogle's algorithm high up in the search results. Google even makes a Wikipedia search engine available to Webmasters for their Websites. The relationship between Google and Wikipedia is clearly intimate and mutually-reinforcing.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Google's new algorithm, cod
enamed Big Daddy, still calculates the popularity of Websites by counting incoming links. An incoming link is a link to a given Website placed on an unrelated page somewhere on the Web. The more numerous such links - the higher the placement in Google's s
e
arch results pages. To avoid spamming and link farms, Google now rates the quality of "good and bad Internet neighborhoods". Not all incoming links are treated equally. Some Internet properties are shunned. Links from such "bad" Websites actually contribu
te negatively to the overall score.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The top results in all 154 keywords I have been diligently monitoring since 1999 have changed dramatically since April 2006. The only common thread in all these upheavals is one: the more incoming links from MySpace a Web
site has - the higher it is placed in the search results. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 In other words: if Website A has 700 incoming links from 700 different Websites and website B has 700 incoming links, all of them from various pages on MySpace, Website B is ranked (much) higher in
 the search results. This holds true even when both Websites A and B sport the same PageRank. This holds true even if the bulk of Website A's incoming links come from "good properties" in "good Internet neighborhoods". Incoming links from MySpace trump ev
ery other category of incoming links.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 An unsettling pattern emerges:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Wikipedia, the "encyclopedia" whose "editors" are mostly unqualified teenagers and young adults is touted by Google as an authoritative source of information. In search results, it is plac
ed well ahead of sources of veritable information such as universities, government institutions, the home pages of recognized experts, the online full-text content of peer-reviewed professional and scholarly publications, real encyclopedias (such as the E
ncarta), and so on.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
MySpace whose 110 million users are predominantly prepubescent and adolescents now dictates what Websites will occupy the first search results in Google's search results pages. It is very easy to spam MySpace. It is considered by some ex
perts to be a vast storehouse of link farms masquerading as "social networks". }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Google has vested, though unofficial and unannounced and, therefore, undisclosed interests in both Wikipedia and MySpace. Wikipedia visitors end up on various properties whose 
search and ad placement technologies are Google's and Wikipedia would have shriveled into insignificance had it not been to Google's relentless promotion of its content.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 Can Teenagers Contribute to an Encyclopedia?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The truth is that teenagers cannot do the
 referencing and research that are the prerequisite to serious scholarship - unless you stretch these words to an absurd limit. Research is not about hoarding facts. It is about identifying and applying context and about possessing a synoptic view of oste
nsibly unrelated data.\line \line Moreover, teenagers can't tell hype from fact and fad from fixture. They lack the perspectives that life and learning -structured, frontal, hierarchical learning - bring with them.\line \line 
Knowledge is not another democratic institution. It is hierarchical for good reason and the hierarchy is built on merit and the merit is founded on learning.\line \line It is not surprising that the Wikipedia emerged in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} whose "culture" consists of truncated attention spans, snippets and so
undbites, shortcuts and cliff notes. The Wikipedia is a pernicious counter-cultural phenomenon. It does not elevate or celebrate knowledge. The Wikipedia degrades knowledge by commoditizing it and by removing the filters and the barriers to entry that hav
e proven so essential hitherto.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This is the fifth essay I have written about the Wikipedia. Evidently, Wikipedians, Wikipedia, and Wikimedia are vehemently opposed to free speech when it is directed against them.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Judge for yourselves:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
A group of Wikipedians apparently decided to take revenge and/or to warn me off. They have authored a defamatory and slanderous article about "Sam Vaknin" in their "encyclopedia'. To leave no room for doubt, at the bottom of this new entry about me, t
hey listed all my articles against the Wikipedia. After repeated complaints, the article was removed, though any "editor" can still write an equally-slanderous new one at any time.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Additionally, I\~received an e-mail message from Brad Patrick, the Wikimedia
's General Counsel (attorney), asking me to copy him on all future correspondence with Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, or anyone else associated with the Wikimedia Foundation and its projects. I declined his "request". He then proceeded to ask to communicate with
 my lawyer since "I raised the issue of suing his client." Couldn't be subtler.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 I was also banned from posting to the Wikipedia - my punishment for what the Wikipedia calls "sockpuppetry" (essentially, editing articles without first logging in to one's acco
unt). It is ironic, since the vast majority of Wikipedians - including the administrator who banned me - edit articles anonymously or hide behind utterly meaningless handles and screen names. There is not a shred of proof, of course, that I have edited an
y article, with or without logging in. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Finally, my name as well as references to my work were removed from a few articles (for instance, from the entries about the Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Narcissism (Psychology)). At least one of the "editors

\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i A. }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 I don't think it's crucial that everyone agree on whether Wikipedia is or is not an encyclopedia. What's impo
rtant is that people who might use it understand what it is and how it differs from the reference works they're used to. Wikipedia allows anyone to write and edit articles, regardless of their knowledge of the subjects on which they're writing, their abil
ity to write, or their commitment to truth. This policy has allowed Wikipedia to grow large very fast, but it's come at a price.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The price is that many of its articles are inaccurate, poorly written, long and bloated, or laden with bias and spin. Despite wh
at some people would like to believe about Wikipedia, that its system is self-correcting, many inaccuracies remain for long periods of time, new ones are added, and, judging from quite a few media reports, sound information posted by people knowledgeable 
o
n a subject is often undone by others who know nothing about it. This is a natural result of the way Wikipedia is put together, its willingness to let anyone write and edit and unwillingness to give precedence to people who know what they're talking about
. People who use Wikipedia should be aware of these liabilities. }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i \line \line 
Q. The Britannica used to be freely accessible until it was converted, a few years back, into a subscriber-only resource. Do you regret this decision? Perhaps if the Britannica were to provi
de a free authoritative alternative to the Wikipedia, it would still be the first stop of seekers of information online?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i A. }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 We don't regret the decision to charge a subscription fee for the premium portions of Britannica Online. Today our site has thousand
s of free articles, and those who subscribe to our premium service pay a fraction of what it cost for access to a high-quality, reliable encyclopedia only a few years ago. About a hundred million people worldwide have access to the Encyclopaedia Britannic
a online, through schools, libraries, and universities, and they don't pay for it at all.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Britannica has indeed become an alternative - not just to Wikipedia but to all of the unreliable information that courses through the public sphere these days, much of
 it on the Internet. The Web has been great for enabling publishers like us to reach many more people than we ever could before, but it's also made it possible for errors, propaganda, and urban myths to appear in the guise of factual truth. As more people
 realize that the contents of the Internet are often not what they seem to be, they've turned to sources like Britannica, which apply the same rigorous standards to our online products that we have always used in\line all of our products.}{\rtlch 
\ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i \line \line Q. "Nature" compared the Wikipedia to the Britannica and resolved that both suffer, more or less, from the same rate of errors. You hotly disputed these findings. Can you elaborate?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

The Encarta Encyclopedia - and even more so, the Encarta Reference Library Premium 2005 - is an impressive refe
rence library. It caters effectively (and, at $70, cheaply) to the educational needs of everyone in the family, from children as young as 7 or 8 years old to adults who seek concise answers to their queries. It is fun-filled, interactive, colorful, replet
e with tens of thousands of images, video clips, and audio snippets. 
\par The Encarta is extremely user-friendly, with its search bar and novel Visual Browser. It comes equipped with a dictionary, thesaurus, chart maker, searchable index of quotations, games, a
nd an Encarta Kids interface. Installation is easy. The Encarta is augmented by weekly or bi-weekly updates and the feature-rich online MSN Encarta Premium with its Homework Help offerings.
\par The Encyclopedia Britannica (established in 1768) sports Student a
nd Elementary versions of its venerable flagship product - but it is far better geared to tackle the information needs of adults and, even more so, professionals. Its 100,000 articles are long and deep, supported by impressive bibliographies, and written 
by the best scholars in their respective fields. 
\par The Britannica, too, come bundled with an atlas (less detailed than the Encarta's), dictionary, thesaurus, classic articles from previous editions, an Interactive Timeline, a Research Organizer, and a Knowle
dge Navigator (a Brain Stormer). It is as user-friendly as the Encarta. The Britannica, though, is updated only 2-4 times a year, a serious drawback, only partially compensated for by 3 months of free access to the its unequalled powerhouse online Web sit
e.
\par It seems that the Britannica and the Encarta cater to different market segments and that the Britannica provides more in-depth coverage of its topics while the Encarta is a more complete, PC-orientated reference experience. The market positioning of the 
Britannica's Elementary and Student Encyclopedias is, therefore, problematic. Encarta has an all-pervasive hold on and ubiquitous penetration of the child-to-young adult markets.
\par Both encyclopedias offer an embarrassment of riches. Users of both find the w
ealth and breadth of information daunting and data mining is fast becoming an art form. Encarta introduced the Visual (Virtual) Browser and Britannica incorporated the Brain Stormer}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf6  }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
to cope with this predicament. But few know how to deploy them effectively.
\par Encarta actively encourages fun-filled browsing and Britannica fully supports serious research. These preferences are reflected in the design of the two products. The Encarta is a riot of colors, sidebars, videos, audio clips, photos, embedded links, lit
erature, Web resources, and quizzes. It is a product of the age of mass communication, a desktop extension of television and the Internet.
\par The Britannica is a sober assemblage of first-rate texts, up to date bibliographies, and minimal multimedia. It is a desktop university library: thorough, well-researched, comprehensive, trustworthy. 
\par Indeed, the Encarta and the Britannica offer competing models for interacting with the 
Internet. Both provide content updates - the Encarta weekly or bi-weekly and the Britannica 2-4 times a year. Both offer additional and timely content and revisions on dedicated Web sites. But the Encarta conditions some of its functions - notably its res
earch tools and updates - on registration with its Plus Club. The Britannica doesn't. 
\par The Encarta incorporates numerous third-party texts and visuals (including dozens of Discovery Channel videos, hundreds of newspaper articles, and a plethora of Scientifi
c American features). The Encarta's multimedia offerings are also impressive with thousands of video and audio clips, maps, tables, and animations. The Britannica provides considerably more text - though it has noticeably enhanced it non-textual content o
ver the year (the 1994-7 editions had nothing or very little but text).
\par Both reference products would do well to integrate with new desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. A seamless experience is in the cards. Users must and will be
 able to ferret content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, and the Web - using a single, intuitive interface. 
\par The new Encarta Search Bar, which was integrated into the product this past year, enables users to search any part of the Encart
a application (encyclopedia, dictionary, thesaurus, etc) without having the application open. Definitely a step in the right direction.
\par Having used both products extensively in the last few months, I found myself entertaining some minor gripes:
\par The Encarta offers 3-D tours which gobble up computer resources and are essentially non-interactive a limited. Is it worth the investment and the risk to the stability and performance of the user's computer?
\par The editorial process is not transparent. It is not clear how both products cope with contemporary and recent developments, minority-sensitive issues, and controversial topics (such as abortion and gay rights).
\par The Encarta tries to cater to the needs of challenged users, such as the visually-impaired - but is still far from doing a good job of it. The Britannica doesn't even bother.
\par The atlas, dictionary, and thesaurus incorporated in both products are surprisingly outdated. Why not use a more current - and dynamically updated - offering? What about dictionaries fo
r specialty terms (medical or computer glossaries, for instance)? The Encarta's New English Dictionary dropped a glossary of computer terms it used to include back in 2001. All's the pity.
\par Both encyclopedias consume (not to say) hog computer resource far in excess of the official specifications. This makes them less suitable for installation on older PCs and on many laptops.\~
Despite the hype, relatively few users possess DVD drives (but those who do find, in both products, the entire encyclopedia available on one DVD).
\par But that's it. Don't think twice. Run to the closest retail outlet (or surf the relevant Web sites) and purchase both products now. Combined, these reference suites offer the best value for money around and significantly enhance you access to 
knowledge and wisdom accumulated over centuries all over the world.

The 2006 edition will include search enhancements to BrainStormer. They're under development right now, so I don't have too many det

\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i TP: }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch Most people like to do keyword searching, so we try to keep that working sharply, but we have also tried to introduce as many other way

Well, I wouldn't say we're "mainly" text based - we have added a lot of multimedia over the years, and we've wo
n some awards for our multimedia - but we will continue to offer comprehensive information for all ages. When you come down to it, the information that really matters in reference works is words. We'll continue to add multimedia as well, space permitting,

This question calls for a treatise of its own. We have advisers all over the world consisting of the top scholars and experts i
n all fields, and with their help we try to bring reason and evidence to bear on developing the best approximation of truth that is humanly possible. Yes, it's hard work, because people disagree on many things, but it can be done reasonably well if you're
 
determined. We strive to the extent possible for coverage that are universal - that is, it takes all major perspectives around the world into account and does not favor one "civilization" over another. One thing we insist on in all of our encyclopedias, r
e
gardless of language or what country they are published in, and that is that coverage of a topic be consistent everywhere. Like our eighteenth-century forebears, we believe that there is such a thing as truth and it is possible for humans to know it. Crea
t
ing an encyclopedia is one of the ways humans do that. So we don't have different "truths," plural, for different countries or markets. We don't pander to local sensitivities or myths by covering a topic one way in one country and a different way in anoth
er.

Most of the navigational features for which most people use the mouse have keyboard equivalents. We plan to do more in this area. We have concentrated in recen

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Microsoft was long derided by its critics for having failed to fully grasp the Internet revolution. It was late in developing Net technologies such
 as a proprietary search engine and in coping with security threats propagated through the Web.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Not any more. Earlier this year MSN rolled out a great search engine and now Microsoft has fundamentally revamped its reference products. By committing itself t
o this overhaul, Microsoft embraced reality: nine out of ten children (between the ages of 5 and 17) use computers ({\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 figures) - and 85% of these get their information online.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Microsoft Encarta Premium 2006 is a breathtaking resour
ce. It caters effectively (and, at $50, affordably) to the educational needs of everyone in the family, from children as young as 7 or 8 years old to adults who seek concise answers to their queries. It is fun-filled, interactive, and colorful. }{\rtlch 
\af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The 2006 E
ncarta's User Interface is far less cluttered than in previous editions. Content is arranged by topics and then by relevancy and medium. Add to this the Encarta's Visual Browser and you get only relevant data in response to your queries. The Encarta Searc
h Bar, which was integrated into the product two years ago, and is resident in the Task Pane even when Encarta is closed, enables users to search any part of the Encarta application (encyclopedia, dictionary, thesaurus, etc).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Encarta's new Web Companion
 is a (giant) step in the right direction. It obtains search results from all the major search engines without launching any additional applications (like a browser). Content from both the Encarta and the Web is presented side by side. This augmentation e
xplicitly adopts the Internet and incorporates it as an important source of reference. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 It may raise important and interesting issues of intellectual property, though. Web content copyright-holders may demand royalties from Microsoft for the use it makes of their wares in its commercial products.}{\rtlch 
\af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Encarta would do well to also integrate with new desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Users should be able to seamlessly access content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, 
and the Web - using a single, intuitive interface. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Encarta Premium includes a dictionary, thesaurus, chart maker, searchable index of quotations, games, 32 Discovery Channel videos, 25,000 photos and illustrations, 2800 sound and audio clips, hundreds
 of maps and tables, and 400 videos and animations. It incorporates numerous third-party texts and visuals (including hundreds of newspaper articles and a plethora of Scientific American features). }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Encarta is augmented by weekly or bi-weekly updates a

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
The Encarta is the most comprehensive, PC-orientated reference experience there is. No wonder it has an all-pervasive hold on and ubiquitous penetration of the child-to-young adult markets. Particularly enchanting is the Encarta Kids interface - an area r
eplete with interactive quizzes, pictures, large icons, hundreds of articles, and links to the full version of the Encarta. A veritable and colorful sandbox. Those kids are going to get addicted to the Encarta, that's for sure!}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Encarta actively encourages f
un-filled browsing. It is a riot of colors, sidebars, videos, audio clips, photos, embedded links, literature, Web resources, and quizzes. It is a product of the age of mass communication, a desktop extension of television and the Internet.}{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Inevitably, in such a mammoth undertaking, not everything is peachy. A few gripes:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Regrettably, installation is not as easy as before. The Encarta 2006 makes use of Microsoft's .Net technology. As most home computers lack it, the installer insists on adding it to the any
how bloated Windows Operating System. There is worse to come: the .Net version installed by Encarta 2006 is plagued with security holes and vulnerabilities. Users have to download service packs and patches from Windows Update if they do not wish to run th
e risk of having their computers compromised by hackers.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Fully installed, the Encarta Premium 2006 gobbles up more than 3.5 Gb. That's a lot - even in an age of ever cheaper storage. Most homesteads still sport PCs with 20-40 Gb hard disks. This makes the E
ncarta less suitable for installation on older PCs and on many laptops.\~Despite the hype, relatively few users possess DVD drives (but those who do, find the entire encyclopedia available on one DVD).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Encarta DVD 3-D tours have improved but they still hog computer resources and are essentially non-interactive. Is it worth the investment and the risk to the stability and performance of the user's computer?}{\rtlch 
\af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Encarta tries to cater to the needs of challenged users, such as the visually-impaired - but is still far from doing a good job of it. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The atlas, dictionary, and thesaurus incorporated in the Encarta are outdated. Why not use a more current - and dynamically updated - offering? What about dictionaries for specialty terms (medical or computer glossa
ries, for instance)? The Encarta's New English Dictionary dropped a glossary of computer terms it used to include back in 2001. All's the pity.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 But that's it. Encarta is a must-buy (especially if you have children). The Encarta is the best value for money 
around and significantly enhances you access to knowledge and wisdom accumulated over centuries all over the world. The amount and quality of content squeezed into a $50 package (before rebate) defies belief. I am a 44 years old adult but when I received 
my Encarta Premium 2006, I was once more a child in a land of wonders. How much is such an experience worth to you?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The previous versions of Encarta included a host of homework tools. These have now been made into a separate product called Microsoft Student. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Homework assignments are the bane of most students I know (not to mention their hard-pressed and nescient parents). This is mainly because of the tedious and mind-numbin
g chores of data mining and composition. Additionally, as knowledge multiplies every 5-10 years, few parents and teachers are able to keep up. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Enter Microsoft Student 2006 - a productivity suite which includes the Encarta Encyclopedia, assignment templates, tutorials, graphing calculator software and a Web Companion. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Similar to the Encarta, MS Student's Web Companion obtains search results from all the major search engines without launching any additional applications (like a browser). Content from both t
he Encyclopedia (the full Encarta encyclopedia is built into MS Student) and the Web is presented side by side. This augmentation explicitly adopts the Internet and incorporates it as an important source of reference - as 80% of students have already done
.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This may raise important and interesting issues of intellectual property, though. Web content copyright-holders may demand royalties from Microsoft for the use it makes of their wares in its commercial products.}{\rtlch 
\af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
MS Student would do well to also integrate with new desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Students will benefit from seamless access to content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, and the Web - using a single, int
uitive interface. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
MS Student's templates are actually clever adaptations of the popular Office suite of products - Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. They help the student produce homework plans and schedules, projects, book reports, presentations, research repo
rts, charts, and analyses of problems in math, physics, and chemistry. Detailed step-by-step tutorials, Quick Starters, and pop-up toolbars (menus) guide the student along the way in a friendly, non-intrusive manner.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The graphing calculator is a wonder. It
 has both 2-D and 3-D capabilities and makes use of the full screen. Aided by an extensive Equations Library, it does everything except cook: trigonometry, calculus, math, charting, geometry, physics, and\~ chemistry. And everything in full color!}{
\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 And if th
is is not enough, the lucky owner is entitled to one year of Online Math Homework Help: step by step instructions and hints for solving math problems (including algebra and geometry). The program addresses most math textbooks and more are added all the ti
me.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
For the student keen on the liberal arts and the humanities, Student 2006 provides detailed Book Summaries of dozens of classic works. Besides plot synopses, the student gets acquainted with the author's life, themes and characters in the tomes, and ide
as for book reports. This is buttressed by a Book of Quotations and the entire corpus of the Encarta Encyclopedia, dictionary, and thesaurus.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This is the first release of a great contribution to learning. Inevitably, it has a few flaws and glitches.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Start 
with the price. As productivity suites go, it is reasonably priced had its target population been adult professional users. But, at $100, it is beyond the reach of most poor students and parents - its most immediate market niches. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Installation is not easy
. MS Student 2006 makes use of Microsoft's .Net technology. As most home computers lack it, the installer insists on adding it to the anyhow bloated Windows Operating System. There is worse to come: the .Net version installed by Encarta 2006 is plagued wi
th security holes and vulnerabilities. Users have to download service packs and patches from Windows Update if they do not wish to run the risk of having their computers compromised by hackers.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Fully installed, Microsoft Student 2006 gobbles up more than 4 
Gb. That's a lot - even in an age of ever cheaper storage. Most homesteads still sport PCs with 20-40 Gb hard disks. This makes the Encarta less suitable for installation on older PCs and on many laptops.\~
Despite the hype, relatively few users possess DVD drives (but those who do, find the entire encyclopedia available on one DVD).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Finally, there is the question of personal creativity and originality. Luckily, MS Student does not spoon-feed its users. It does not substitute for thinking or for study. On the
 contrary, by providing structured stimuli, it encourages the student to express his or her ideas. It does not do the homework assignments for the student - it merely helps rid them of time-consuming and machine-like functions. And it opens up to both stu
dent and family the wonderful twin universes of knowledge: the Encarta and the Web.

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Inevitably, in such a mammoth undertaking, not everything is peachy. A few gripes:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

 I said, installation is not as easy as before. The Encarta 2007 makes use of Microsoft's .Net technology. As most home computers lack it, the installer insists on adding it to the anyhow bloated Windows Operating System. There is worse to come: the .Net 
version installed by Encarta 2007 is plagued with security holes and vulnerabilities. Users have to download service packs and patches from Windows Update if they do not wish to run the risk of having their computers compromised by hackers.}{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
Fully installed on the hard disk, the Encarta Premium 2007 gobbles up less than its predecessors but still a whopping 3 Gb. That's a lot - even in an age of ever cheaper storage. Most homesteads still sport PCs with 20-40 Gb hard disks. This makes the Enc
arta less suitable for installation on older PCs and on many laptops.\~}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Encarta DVD 3-D tours have improved but they still hog computer resources and are essentially non-interactive. Is it worth the investment and the risk to the stability and performance of the user's computer?}{\rtlch 
\af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Encarta tries to cater to the needs of challenged users, such as the visually-impaired - but it is far from doing a good or full job of it. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The dictionary has been greatly improved in this edition. Actually, the Encarta 2007 
comes equipped with five foreign language dictionaries and verb conjugating applications. Still, the atlas, English language dictionary, and thesaurus incorporated in the Encarta are somewhat outdated. Why not use a more current - and dynamically updated 
- offering? What about dictionaries for specialty terms (medical or computer glossaries, for instance)? The Encarta's New English Dictionary dropped a glossary of computer terms it used to include back in 2001. All's the pity.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 But that's it. Encarta is a mu
st-buy (especially if you have children). The Encarta is the best value for money around and significantly enhances you access to knowledge and wisdom accumulated over centuries all over the world. The amount and quality of content squeezed into a $50 pac
kage (before rebate) defies belief. I am a 45 years old adult but when I received my Encarta Premium 2007, I was once more a child in a land of wonders. How much is such an experience worth to you?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\ltrch \b\i\fs27 Microsoft Student 2007}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
The previous versions of Encarta included a host of homework tools. Last year, these have been made into a separate product called Microsoft Student. It has now been gainfully repackaged and very much enhanced. Among the new or revamped features
: free online access to MSN Encarta Premium, Step-by-Step Math Solutions calculator, Step-by-Step Math Textbook Solutions, Triangle Solver, Equations Library, tutorials, and foreign language help. MS Student comes replete with the entire Encarta Premium e
ncyclopedia!}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
Homework assignments are the bane of most students I know (not to mention their hard-pressed and nescient parents). This is mainly because of the tedious and mind-numbing chores of data mining and composition. Additionally, as knowledge multipl
ies every 5-10 years, few parents and teachers are able to keep up. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Enter Microsoft Student 2007 - a productivity suite which, as we mentioned, includes the Encarta Encyclopedia, English and foreign language dictionaries, thesaurus, quotations library, as
signment templates, tutorials, graphing calculator software and a Web Companion. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Similar to the Encarta, MS Student's Web Companion obtains search results from all the major search engines without launching any additional applications (like a browser). Co
ntent from both the Encyclopedia and the Web is presented side by side. This augmentation explicitly adopts the Internet and incorporates it as an important source of reference - as 80% of students have already done.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 I am not sure how Microsoft solved the 
weighty and interesting issues of intellectual property that the Web Companion raises, though. Copyright-holders of Web content may feel that they have the right to be compensated by Microsoft for the use it makes of their wares in its commercial products
.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
MS Student would do well to also integrate with new desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Students will benefit from seamless access to content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, and the Web - using a single, int
uitive interface. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
MS Student's templates are actually clever adaptations of the popular Office suite of products - Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. They help the student produce homework plans and schedules, projects, book reports, presentations, research rep
orts, charts, and analyses of problems in math, physics, and chemistry. Detailed step-by-step tutorials, Quick Starters, and pop-up toolbars (menus) guide the student along the way in a friendly, non-intrusive manner.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The graphing calculator is a wonder. I
t has both 2-D and 3-D capabilities and makes use of the full screen. Aided by an extensive Equations Library, it does everything except cook: trigonometry, calculus, math, charting, geometry, physics, and\~ chemistry. And everything in full color!}{
\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 For the 
student keen on the liberal arts and the humanities, Student 2007 provides detailed Book Summaries of almost 1000 classic works. Besides plot synopses, the student gets acquainted with the author's life, themes and characters in the tomes, and ideas for b
ook reports.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 MS Student 2007 is a great contribution to learning. Inevitably, it has a few flaws and glitches.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Start with the price. As productivity suites go, it is reasonably priced had its target population been adult professional users. But, at $70-100,
 it is beyond the reach of most poor students and parents - its most immediate market niches.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 MS Student 2007 makes use of Microsoft's .Net technology. As most home computers lack it, the installer insists on adding it to the anyhow bloated Windows Operati
ng System. There is worse to come: the .Net version installed by MS Student 2007 is plagued with security holes and vulnerabilities. Users have to download service packs and patches from Windows Update if they do not wish to run the risk of having their c
omputers compromised by hackers.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
Fully installed on the hard disk, MS Student 2007 gobbles up less than its predecessors but still a whopping 4 Gb. That's a lot - even in an age of ever cheaper storage. Most homesteads still sport PCs with 20-40 Gb hard dis
ks. This makes MS Student less suitable for installation on older PCs and on many laptops.\~}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Finally, there is the question of personal creativity and originality. Luckily, MS Student does not spoon-feed its users. It does not substitute for thinking or for
 study. On the contrary, by providing structured stimuli, it encourages the student to express his or her ideas. It does not do the homework assignments for the student - it merely helps rid them of time-consuming and machine-like functions. And it opens 
up to both student and family the wonderful twin universes of knowledge: the Encarta and the Web.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Last October, Project Gutenberg (PG) - the Web's first and largest online library of free electronic books - released a long-awaited DVD containing close to 10,000 
of its titles. Since then, another 1000 texts were added to its burgeoning archives. The Project spawned numerous other Web sites. Some of them - such as Blackmask - offer free downloads and sell their own DVD with mostly Project Gutenberg eBooks in multi
ple formats. Others provide free browsers and library applications specific to PG's content.
\par The man behind the Project - and, thus, the inventor of the ebook in 1971 - is Michael Hart. 
\par Always available to preach the gospel of free content and its benefits, he responded to UPI's questions, joined by Greg Newby, Chief Executive of the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Q. In October 2003, you set a new target for Project Gutenberg of one million free ebooks by the year 2015. Are there so many books in the public domain? And what then?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Michael: }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 
Archimedes said, "give me a lever long enough, and I will move the world." Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.org) is just such a lever, enabling a single person to create something of immense value that is made a
vailable to millions of people. If we have reached a mere 1.5% of the world's population, we have already given away a trillion eBooks.\line \line 
Project Gutenberg is a grass roots operation, never having had real funding or grants. For 30 years people said that we won't be around next year. When we started to get close to 10,000 eBooks, they finally stopped.\line \line 
There are lots of pretend eBook operations, but none of them produce all of their eBooks themselves, or have 10,000 of their own eBooks that can be read by virtually any text reader and word processor\line \line 
The next big step, after we have reached a million eBooks, will be to translate each of them into as many as 100 languages, thus making them available to an even larger audience.\line \line Regarding the number of titles i
n the public domain, during the 20th Century, there were many years in which over 50,000 books were published and the rate has been increasing throughout. Certainly there were a million titles published before 1923 that we can get our hands on, not to men
tion non-book items such as newspapers, magazines, brochures and advertisements, court records and other government documents, unpublished manuscripts and diaries, music, film, photographs, audio, and other art forms.\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 
\ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Greg:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604  My calculation, based on the US 
Library of Congress' copyright renewal records, is that there are about 1 million books published from 1923 - 1964 that are demonstrably in the public domain.\~ We are seeking to "discover" these items.\~
 The copyrights of only 10% of all published items are ever renewed.\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 
Q. Libraries on CD-ROMs are at least a decade old. Why did Project Gutenberg wait until now to issue its own DVD?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Michael: }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Because there was always someone out there willing to do it for us. Because CD burners and DVD burners finally got so
 cost effective that we could afford to give away this kind of media. Because today you can't buy a computer off the shelf without a DVD drive. Until now, physical media could not compete on a cost effective basis with Internet downloads.
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Greg: }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 We have some volunteers willing to create CD and DVD images and we now distribute them.\~
But we hope to find many other channels to distribute our content for free or for a small fee.\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Q. Why don't simple scans or raw OCR (optical character recognition) output qualify
 as ebooks? What is the technological future of ebooks - is it Machine Translation and, if yes, why?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Michael: }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 
Book scanning is outsourced half way across the world and the results are shoddy and often cannot be used as input for OCR programs, to create a text file, for instance.
\par In contrast, once a true eBook is created, it has more value than a paper copy, because it can be copied ad infinitum, sent all over the world, even to a billion readers, and can be the basis for hundreds of new paper and eBook edit
ions, all at virtually no cost.\line \line Moreover, people are not interested in scans. Some Project Gutenberg sites each hand out 10 million eBooks per year - impossible with scanned images or full text eBooks due to their bandwidth-consuming oversize. 
\line \line The "scan
ners" want to be the only source for "their" books, even when those books are in the public domain - and are willing to claim copyright on the public domain works of Project Gutenberg in the process. They deny themselves true access to the public.\line 
\line Our Unl
imited Distribution Model calls for everyone to have a library of 10,000 eBooks, stored on a single DVD that costs only $1. People find this appealing. There are perhaps 10,000 volunteers to create our kind of ebooks - against only a few hundred people, a
ll paid, working to create libraries of scans.\line \line 
Additionally, the huge scan files hold just a single book, are not searchable, cannot be copied, indexed, or cited by off the shelf applications, typos can't be corrected, and are not truly portable due to their size. 
\par }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604 \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 
Project Gutenberg eBooks can be read in any manner the reader chooses - favorite fonts, margination, number of lines per page can all be modified. The reader becomes his or her own publisher. People with disabilities can use a speech engine to r
ead the texts aloud. The visually challenged can change the font size. This is impossible to do with scans.\line \line 
With CD burners available for under $15, and DVD burners for $100, with blank media so cheap - the cost of individual books becomes literally "too cheap to meter." And that is the whole point of the Project Gutenberg eBook library.
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Greg: }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 
EBooks are editable and suitable for creating derivative works. They are not intended to be a depiction of a printed artifact, but a direct means of experiencing the
 author's writing. Today's best OCR still makes (on average) several errors per page of text, and requires human intervention to handle things like page headings and footnotes.
\par We plan to make PG's ebooks easily transformable among different digital formats - XML, HTML, PDF, Braille, audiobooks, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}TeX{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
, RTF and others. Features - such as fonts, or background colors - will be selectable.\~Machine translation (MT) will be another of these "formats", but it is currently technologically premature and immature. 
\par In cooperation with partner organizations in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Europe{\*\xmlclose} and elsewhere, we hope to help to develop better MT software. We are supporting a project in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Europe{\*\xmlclose}
 to augment MT with human translation, much as today's OCR must be helped by human proofreaders to achieve a low error rate.\line }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 \line 
Q. How would you suggest to balance the need to protect the intellectual property rights of authors and the need to disseminate knowledge?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Michael: }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), in cahoots with c
ommercial interests, leave no quarter for anyone, and seem to want permanent copyright.\line \line How do you achieve balance with someone who wants it all?\line \line 
Originally, copyright came about because the Stationers' Guild wanted to entrench their monopoly on the written word after it was shattered by the Gutenberg Press. Similarly, in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname 
City}}United States{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, every copyright extension has had the same purpose, to destroy the effectiveness of a new publishing technology.\line \line The 1909 Copyright Act destroyed t
he reprint houses made possible by the new steam and electric presses. The 1976 Copyright Act was enacted merely to stifle the effect of the Xerox machine. The 1998 Copyright Act was a response to the effects of the Internet. When it is difficult to make 
copies, it is legal because only the rich can do it. As soon as it becomes easy enough for the masses to have copies it is made illegal!\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Greg: }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Publishers and media houses are adept at appropriating the intellectual property rights of authors for their own profits.\~
They are insensitive to the social contract of copyright that should result in the release of items to the public domain after a reasonable period. Life of the author + 70 years is not a reasonable period, neither is 95 or 120 years after the crea
tion of the copyrighted work.\line \line Only a fraction of the items currently under copyright are actually available, from anyone at any price.\~
The only benefit accrues to media producers, who restrict the quantity of available prior materials so that their new material is more likely to be purchased.\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 
Q. The commercial ebook industry is going through a bloodbath. Cracked versions of the newest books are available online. Do you believe that ebooks, by nature, should be free - or is there a place for commercial digital content?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Greg: }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 I favor the development of a commercial eBook industry.\~
 Project Gutenberg should be seen as a benefit to that industry, not an adversary. Similarly, I see commercial eBooks as being able to benefit Project Gutenberg, simply by getting more people to read eBooks.\line \line 
The industry is a victim of its own incompetence.\~ They did not suffer from a lack of publicity or advertising, but from a lack of usability, standard formats, and sufficient content.\~They also adopted a crippling cost model th
at artificially keeps the price of a new hardcover at $20 or so, and a crippling industry model that necessitates enormous overhead to get their ever-decreasing catalog of items, printed on dead trees, delivered to shopping malls.\line \line 
Fear of illicit copying (music and video) seems to dominate their thinking.\~ At the same time, the leading organizations (the Author's Guild, the MPAA and the RIAA) are seeking to reduce the realm of fair use.\~
Had these organizations embraced fair use, and introduced reasonable products at reasonable prices, they would not have needed to worry so much about piracy.\~ \line \line 
The failure of the eBook is the failure of the industries behind it, not the failure of the idea or lack of a market.\~ I think it will take new thinkers, and new companies, to garner success.\~
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 Michael: }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10498604\charrsid10498604 
Most of the bloodbath I have seen was among the commercial hardware eBook industry, people who wanted to control the reading habits of their customers, who did not want them to read anything that was not paid for and de
livered by same commercial interests. When upgrades turn into downgrades to WIPOut access to public domain eBooks that used to be accessible before - that is a "Bad Thing."\~ \line \line 
The beauty, the purpose, of eBooks is to re-create the Gutenberg Press. Books whose replication and dissemination all over the world cost nothing, that require no deforestation, warehousing and shipping, that do not end up in the landfills of the world.
\line \line The purpose of eBooks is to create a library anyone can carry, weighing under one
 ounce per ten thousand volumes on standard writable DVDs, or one ounce per 25,000 books on double sided or double leveled DVDs. One kilo of these newer DVDs can hold 1,000,000 eBooks!\line \line 
And I plan to have just such double sided DVDs to hand out for the holidays two years from now. . . .}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}? Do you feel vindicated - or unjustly ignored?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i A. }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Actually both, and quite thoroughly in both cases.\line \line 
Each time an organization claims to have invented eBooks or eLibraries, I feel both vindicated and ignored, not that either one of these is new.\line \line However, vindication, for me, comes from the bottom up, not the top down.\line \line 
Project Gutenberg is the perfect example of a "grass roots" opposite of "The Trickle-Down Theories" that run the world today. We are truly, "Of the people, by the people, for the people."\line \line We are truly a "Trickle-}{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 
\ltrch \b\i\fs27 UP}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 " project, which has been virtually ignored simply because of those who follow the first rule of reporting: }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 "Follow The Money" can never follow Project Gutenberg, since we've never had any money whatsoever.\line \line However, if we }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 DID}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
 get just a penny for every one of the trillion plus eBooks we have given away, based on reaching just 1% of the population, we would have enough to buy out Donald Trump, and the press would beat our doors down to give us coverage.\line \line 
Still, it is }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 MUCH}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27  more important to show that Project Gutenberg }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 has}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
 changed the world. . .without money. . .without being co-opted by the Big Boys, simply by continuing to do this job for 35 years.\line \line Today you can get over 50,000 titles from the Project Gutenberg sites, with no hassle, no money, no cookies, ma
ny even with no Internet. (via SneakerNet - This is when you put on your sneakers to run across the street with a CD-ROM or DVD.\line \line 
Our target audience is the person on the street, not the ivory tower scholars, who all want to take over how our books should look, and not the corporations, who will only want to take over in the same way they took over music downloads only}{\rtlch 
\ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27  AFTER}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27  they proved to be successful.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Most business plans target the 1% of the population that is most geared towards their product, and this 
is why they consider a "million seller" to be a great success, while Project Gutenberg targets 100 million as a reasonable success.\line \line 
Most business plans are elitist by their very nature, as they target an extremely small portion of the population. Project 
Gutenberg was a new business plan, targeting virtually everyone and it has proven to be the most successful plan of how to use the Internet.\line \line Google?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Google made lots of predictions and promises: "Today is the day the world changes,"\line \line But as of now, Google
 hadn't really even gotten started, with only 3 downloadable eBooks we could find. However, in response to Yahoo's Open Content Alliance, Google had to finally start releasing books, over 300 days into their project.\line \line I would have }{\rtlch 
\ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 LOVED}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27  to see Google put u
p 10,000 eBooks per week in the 10 months since their zillion dollar media blitz last December 14th (2004). They would be now approaching their 500,000th eBook, and Project Gutenberg would be working on ways to distribute them even more widely, do more pr

{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}July 4th, 1971{\*\xmlclose}, when I first invented eBooks and thought about the repercussions:\line \line 
"You will be able to hold the Library of Congress in one hand, but I am sure they will stop us from being able to do that."\line (Said at The Materials Research Lab, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}University

\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i 2. How do you feel about e-book piracy? Is it partly a reaction to overly onerous copyright laws? Does PG work with intellectual property lawyers? }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i A. }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 I used to mention in my 
emails that there were thousands of "Pirates' Coves" online, but not one of them did eBooks, and that we would know when eBooks had finally "made it" when such things came into existence, just as the sales of the first million selling book, Uncle Tom's Ca
bin, were largely due to pirated editions. Anyone who says the publishers'\line history doesn't include piracy, just isn't looking. Pirated editions of Uncle Tom did the same for the publishing industry\line as Napster did for the music download industry.
}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 As for the 
book industry, the news media is constantly filled with stories about how a gallon of gas that was $.25 in 1955 has gone up 10 times over, but the price of paperbacks that were $.25 in 1955 is now $10, not $2.50, about 40 times as much, yet this is never 
m
entioned. I can only remark here that readers of these books have been victims of price increases four times as much as drivers. Yet, you never once have seen a news story about the high prices book stores are charging as compared to gas stations, have yo
u?\line \line So, some piracy indeed has to do with the price of books spiraling out of control and out of the reach of many readers.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The real question is: "Who is the victim of piracy here?"\line \line Is it the publishers, who have spent a billion dollars to make you think s
o - or the public, who is paying 4 times as much for paperback books as for gas, when they were the same price when paperbacks first came out?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, some piracy has to do with translations that aren't available to the public, and some of it thrives in places where no legitimate copies are available at all. I have been to locations in 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Asia{\*\xmlclose} and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Europe{\*\xmlclose} where the publishers simply don't care to sell - no matter how hard one looked - and then they complain that someone is making copies.
\line \line In the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}US{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 is it legal for libraries to make copies for patrons when there is no copy readily available, either due to being hard to get or because the price is too high. I presume this might also be the case in other countries.\line \line 
I think you will find this in Section 108 of the US Copyright Law.\line \line Obviously when materials are not readily available, people might be expected to take things into their own hands as the law above obviously provides for.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 As far as our "legal eagles" go, each Project Gutenberg has guidelines to stay within their local copyright. The really hard copyright research is handed over to our legal experts.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i 3. Do you think that Project Gutenberg - the largest online repository of public domain and copyrighted books - threatens the publishing industry's and media conglomerates' vested interests?\~
 PG is now distributed on DVD as well. Can this be construed as an incursion into traditional publishers' turf? Is disintermediation on the cards - the blurring of lines between author, publisher, and reader?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 A. The publishers view any competition as an incursion on their turf, particularly the expiration of any copyrights, whether the books were still in print or not.\line \line The publishers want to be the }{\rtlch 
\ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 ONLY}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27  source of information, and to make it available on a "pay per" basis, so the greatest effect of these copyright extensions is not to have }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 
MORE}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27  books in bookstores, but }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 FEWER}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 , as that new copyright law prevents us from having public domain editions from the millions of bo
oks covered by the new copyright terms.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 If people knew the copyright laws were being manipulated each time a new technology comes along that }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 COULD}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
 actually bring the public domain to the masses, then they probably would say or do something about it. But co
pyright laws are enacted quietly and behind smokescreens. The US Copyright Act of 1998 was passed in the same 24 hours as President Clinton was impeached, and behind closed doors - I tried to testify - with a voice vote only so there would be no voting re
cord. Thus, a common person would never have heard about it. }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 Even I}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 , who was trying to go testify, didn't learn about it for three weeks after the fact.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Every time a new technology was invented that would stop the publishers' monopoly, 
copyright laws were enacted to stifle it. After all, the first copyright was simply reactionary political maneuvering by The Stationers' Guild to get their monopoly over the written word back, and the same reactionary politics caused the US Copyright Acts
 to counteract steam printing presses, electric printing presses, the Xerox machine, and now the Internet.\line \line US Copyright Acts were enacted:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 1831 to stop the first high speed steam printing press of 1830 and because the first 28 year copyrights from the 1790 Copyright Act were starting to expire. Heaven forbid a copyright should expire!}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 1909 to stop electric presses from reprinting public domain works, etc.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 1976 to stop public domain from flowing through xeroxes}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\ltrch \b\i\fs27 BE}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27  any more obvious, except that the media won't say anything to us about copyright, so how could we know. . .it's not taught.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
We have been threatened with a number of lawsuits, mostly by lawyers who seem to know very little about copyright. After we explained what we are doing, under which laws, it turns out they were just "blowing smoke" at us, trying to make us honor rights th
ey don't have, with any legal explanation of what law[s] would give them rights over the material in question.\line \line 
We're thinking of starting the OED, Oxford English Dictionary, and we expect more smoke from them, since they reacted this way at our initial ann
ouncement of this years ago, and threatened us when we posted "The Oxford Book Of English Verse," but they went away after getting me called on the carpet by a local University of Illinois Chancellor who happened to be Tom Cruise's uncle, and so worth the
 visit. By the way, this fellow was so Luddite he said he would quit the day he had to use e-mail.\line \line We don't have any affiliation with the UI, but {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Oxford{\*\xmlclose}
{\*\xmlclose} was going to use all the muscle they could muster, we'll see what they do when we do our first OED posting.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
Regarding the DVD, anything that is free can be said to threaten that which is not free, just as anything that is not free can be said to threaten that which is free. If you study the history of copyright, this will become quite obvious.}{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 As f
or disintermediation, it has been there all along. If you have computers you can be a publisher, an author, a reader. . .with a potential audience larger than any paper medium. Recently this has been exemplified by the first million selling music download
 
by Gwen Stefani. . .. Just think what is going to happen when we have our first million selling music download that isn't run through a major music label! Think it can't happen? Just watch, and remember what happened after Dido's initial CD flopped with n
o
 push from her label: it became a multimillion seller after it was sampled in that famous music video. Not to mention that Lisa Loeb had a million seller on CD without ever being signed to a label. The day is coming when artists, musicians, authors, and o
ther artists will be free from the contracts of the publishing industry that give them $50,000 out of each million dollars in sales. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 I would have to say the most important thing I learned in the past 35 years of thinking about eBooks is that the underlying\line philosophy since time immemorial is:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 "It is better if }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 I}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27  have it, and }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 YOU}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27  do }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The philosophy of Unlimited Distribution.\line \line This is perhaps the largest paradigm shift possible in world thought, shifting from the ideal that all things can be\line had onl
y in limited supply ("supply side economics") to a new ideal that things can be produced such that everyone can have\line all they want.\line \line 
With eBooks, everyone can have all they want without any effort to limit what other people can have. Before eBooks this was only possible with the air supply.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i 6. What should be the role of government in all this?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 We have had governments for ages that have }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 SAID}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
 they would be delighted to feed, clothe, house, and educate the world, if it were not so expensive.\line \line Yet for 35 years no government has taken the steps to provide an electronic public library for the people. Add to this the\line 
number of academic institutions, cities, states, and nations, as well as charities, and you begin to realize that eBooks in\line some sense are being ignored by thousands of institutions who }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 SAY}{\rtlch 
\af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27  their interest lies in providing for the masses.\line \line We have been capable of bringing every word ever written to a wider audience than ever before for years, but the truth is a\line 
movement to deny access to this information has been underway for even longer in the form of continuous copyright extensions.\line \line 
The prime example, obviously the one I name my own work after when I started Project Gutenberg, is The Gutenberg Press. Before Gutenberg the average book cost as much as the average family farm, 
and thus was out of the question for the average person on the street, much less for the even more persons who lived in places that didn't have any paved streets. Books were virtually inaccessible before The Gutenberg Press, other than to the elite of wea
lth, education, and religion.\line \line Not only were books inaccessible to the person on the street, but even if they could manage to get a book the vast majority\line 
couldn't even come close to reading it. This provided a great wall insulating Haves from Haves-not. The Haves could read, the Haves-not could not read, and the advantage to the Haves is incalculable.\line \line 
If you look at the attitudes toward Unlimited Distribution of eBooks you will find that the primary motivation here is wall\line preservation: preserving Haves and Haves-not as classes in a time when billions could have every word ever written.\line 
\line There have been well over a billion computers made. There have been one billion cell phones added since the beginning of last year, and a another billion, or more, may be m
ade before the end of next year, and each is going to be capable to serve an eBook reader. And this does not include millions of PDAs, iPods, etc., much less millions of game consoles that can be used for eBooks.\line \line 
The truth is that there have been enough eBook capable devices made that everyone who can read could have one and still some would be left over.\line \line

for new laws to make all publication, other than their own, a violation of the law.\line \line They did this in two very powerful ways:\line \line 1. Everyone else's printing presses were declared illegal.\line \line 
2. A "copyright" patent was granted The Stationers, to "own" the only license for publication of all words ever written.\line \line The first few attempts at such laws were met with such hatred that they were never enforced, and finally were withdrawn. 
\line However, after over 150 years of trying to convince dozens of courtiers and monarchs, and failing, "The Stationers Company" was finally granted 
a royal patent, and became the only legal operators of the dreaded Gutenberg Press that had ruined such monopoly powers they had had since the dawn of time}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

 about global information sharing, but they are really a collection of insiders doing insider things, and they are not really interested in
 getting eBooks to the common person , but rather mostly to those who are well-read and being well-educated already. In this sense, I agree with those who say there is still a great deal of Digital Divide.\line \line

\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 A. }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
I know what everyone knows from being exposed to the news media and to lawsuits filed by publishers: the phenomenon is widespread and most of the millions of exchanged files are music tracks and films (though book rip-offs are not unknown as well).\line 
\line }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 Q. Why do you think people are taking part in these electronic transactions? Does the cost of purchasing the media come into play? }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 A. }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 It's a complex canvass of motivations, I guess. Many media produc
ts (especially in developing and poor countries) are overpriced in terms of the local purchasing power. Illegally downloading them is often an act of protest or defiance against what disgruntled consumers perceive as excessive profiteering. It may also be
 the only realistic way to gain ownership of coveted content. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The fact that everything - from text to images - is digital makes replication facile and enticing. Illegal downloading also probably confers an aura of daring and mystique on the "pirates" invol
ved (whose life may otherwise be a lot drearier and mundane).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Additionally, these products resemble public goods in that they are nonrivalrous (the cost of extending the service or providing the good to another person is (close to) zero) and largely nonexcludable.}{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
Most products are rivalrous (scarce) - zero sum games. Having been consumed, they are gone and are not available to others. Public goods, in contrast, are accessible to growing numbers of people without any additional marginal cost. This wide disp
ersion of benefits renders them unsuitable for private entrepreneurship. It is impossible to recapture the full returns they engender. As Samuelson observed, they are extreme forms of positive externalities (spillover effects).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Moreover, it is impossible to exclude anyone from enjoying the benefits of a public good, or from defraying its costs (positive and negative externalities). Neither can anyone willingly exclude himself from their remit.}{
\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Needless to emphasize that media products are not public goods a
t all! They only superficially resemble public goods. Still, the fact that many books, music, and some films are, indeed, in the public domain further exacerbates the consumer's confusion. "Why can I (legally) download certain books and music tracks free 
of charge - but not others?" - wonders the baffled surfer, who is rarely versed in the intricacies of copyright laws.\line \line }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 
Q. Do you think this leads to a feeling of disrespect toward the various pieces of media by the person that steals it so frequently? (If I download music all the time, will I lose interest in it?) \line }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 \line }{\rtlch 
\ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 A. }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
I am not sure that the word "respect" is relevant here. People don't respect or disrespect music - they enjoy it, like it, or dislike it. But frequent illegal downloading of media products is,
 probably, the outcome of disrespect towards content intermediaries such as publishers, producers, and retail outlets. I don't know for sure because there is no research to guide us in this matter, but I would imagine that these people (wrongly) perceive 
content intermediaries as parasitic and avaricious.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 Q. Downloading is still a widespread act today. The threats of lawsuits and legal action against downloaders hasn't stopped the problem. What, in your opinion, needs to be done to stop this behavior? }{\rtlch 
\af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 \line \line }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 A. }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
Law enforcement activities and lawsuits are already having an effect. But you cannot prosecute thousands of people on a regular basis without suffering a commensurate drop in popularity and a tarnished image. People do not perceive these acts as self-defe
nse but as David vs. Goliath bullying. Sooner or later, the efficacy of such measures is bound to decline.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

A. I cannot but speculate. There is a dearth of data at this early stage. I would imagine that illegal downloaders are hoarders. They are into owning things rather than int
o using or consuming them. They are into building libraries and collections. They are young and intelligent, but not affluent. They are irreverent, rebellious, and non-conformist. They may be loners who network socially only online. Some of them love cult
ure and its artifacts but they need not be particularly computer-savvy.\~ }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par LexiBot, in the words of its inventors, is...
\par \~
\par "...the first and only search technology capable of identifying, retrieving, qualifying, classifying and organizing "deep" and "surface" content from the World Wide Web.\~
 The LexiBot allows searchers to dive deep and explore hidden data from multiple sources simultaneously using directed queries. Businesses, researchers and consumers now have access to the most
 valuable and hard-to-find information on the Web and can retrieve it with pinpoint accuracy."

It places dozens of queries, in dozens of threads simultaneously and spiders the results (rather as a "first generation" search engine would do). This could p
rove very useful with massive databases such as the human genome, weather patterns, simulations of nuclear explosions, thematic, multi-featured databases, intelligent agents (e.g., shopping bots) and third generation search engines. It could also have imp
lications on the wireless internet (for instance, in analysing and generating location-specific advertising) and on e-commerce (which amounts to the dynamic serving of web documents).
\par \~
\par This transition from the static to the dynamic, from the given to the g
enerated, from the one-dimensionally linked to the multi-dimensionally hyperlinked, from the deterministic content to the contingent, heuristically-created and uncertain content - is the real revolution and the future of the web. Search engines have lost 
t
heir efficacy as gateways. Portals have taken over but most people now use internal links (within the same web site) to get from one place to another. This is where the deep web comes in. Databases are about internal links. Hitherto they existed in splend
id isolation, universes closed but to the most persistent and knowledgeable. This may be about to change. The flood of quality relevant information this will unleash will dramatically dwarf anything that preceded it.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par The hype over ubiquitous (or pervasive) computing (computers everywhere) has masked a potentially more momentous development. It is the convergence of computing devices inter
faces with web (or other) content. Years ago - after Bill Gates overcame his misplaced\~
scepticism - Microsoft introduced their "internet-ready" applications. Its word processing software ("Word"), other Office applications, and the Windows operating system
 handle both "local" documents (resident on the user's computer) and web pages smoothly and seamlessly. The transition between the desktop or laptop interfaces and the web is today effortlessly transparent.
\par \~
\par The introduction of e-book readers and MP3 play
ers has blurred the anachronistic distinction between hardware and software. Common speech reflects this fact. When we say "e-book", we mean both the device and the content we access on it. As technologies such as digital ink and printable integrated circ
uits mature - hardware and software will have completed their inevitable merger.
\par \~
\par This erasure of boundaries has led to the emergence of knowledge management solutions and personal and shared workspaces. The LOCATION of a document (one's own computer, a colleague's PDA, or a web page) has become irrelevant. The NATURE of the document (
e
-mail message, text file, video snippet, soundbite) is equally unimportant. The SOURCE of the document (its extension, which tells us on which software it was created and can be read) is increasingly meaningless. Universal languages (such as Java) allow d
evices and applications to talk to each other. What matters are accessibility and logical and user-friendly work-flows.
\par \~
\par Enter Enfish. In its own words, it provides:
\par \~
\par "...Personalized portal solution linking personal and corporate knowledge with relevant 
information from the Internet, ...live-in desktop environment providing co-branding and customization opportunities on and offline, a unique, private communication channel to users that can be used also for eBusiness solutions, ...Knowledge Management sol
ution that requires no user set-up or configuration."
\par \~
\par The principle is simple enough - but the experience is liberating (try their online flash demo). Suddenly, instead of juggling dozens of windows, a single interface provides the tortured user (that's I
) with access to all his applications: e-mail, contacts, documents, the company's intranet or network, the web and OPC's (other people's computers, other networks, other intranets). There is only a single screen and it is dynamically and automatically upd
ated to respond to the changing information needs of the user.
\par \~
\par "The power underlying Enfish Onespace is its patented DEX 'engine.' This technology creates a master, cross-referenced index of the contents of a user's email, documents and Internet information. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid10967902\charrsid16322966 

\par \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 
The Enfish engine then uses this master index as a basis to understand what is relevant to a user, and to provide them with appropriate information. In this manner Enfish Onespace 'personalizes' the Internet for each user, automatically connecting re
levant information and services from the Internet with the user's desktop information.
\par \line As an example, by clicking on a person or company, Enfish Onespace automatically assembles a page that brings together related emails, documents, contact information, a
ppointments, news and relevant news headlines from the Internet. This is accomplished without the user working to find and organize this information. By having everything in one place and in context, our users are more informed and better prepared to perf
orm tasks such as handling a phone call or preparing for a business meeting. This results in ... benefits in productivity and efficiency."
\par \~
\par It is, indeed, addictive. The inevitable advent of transparent computing (smart houses, smart cards, smart clothes, 
smart appliances, wireless Internet) - coupled with the single GUI (Graphic User Interface) approach can spell revolution in our habits. Information will be available to us anywhere, through an identical screen, communicated instantly and accurately from 
d
evice to device, from one appliance to another and from one location to the next as we move. The underlying software and hardware will become as arcane and mysterious as are the ASCII and ASSEMBLY languages to the average computer user today. It will be a
 real partnership of biological and artificial intelligence on the move.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid8208409\charrsid16322966

\insrsid14553058\charrsid16322966 The Internet started off as a purely America
n phenomenon and seemed to perpetuate the fast-emerging dominance of the English language. A negligible minority of web sites were in other languages. Software applications were chauvinistically ill-prepared (and still are) to deal with anything but Engli

\par All this started to change rapidly about two years ago. Early this year, the number of American users of the Net was surpassed by t

{\*\xmlclose} - is likely to strengthen this unmistakable trend. By 2005, certain an
alysts expect non-English speakers to make up to 70% of all netizens. This fragmentation of an hitherto unprecedentedly homogeneous market - presents both opportunities and costs. It is much more expensive to market in ten languages than it is in one. Eve

 that the Internet is bound to become. 
\par Enter WorldWalla. A while back I used their multi-lingual e-mail application. It converted text I typed on a virtual keyboard to images (of characters
). My addressees received the message in any language I selected. It was more than cool. It was liberating. Along the same vein, WorldWalla's software allows application and content developers to work in 66 languages. In their own words: 
\par "WordWalla allows
 device manufacturers and application developers to meet this challenge by developing products that support any language. This simplifies testing and configuration management, accelerates time to market, lowers unit costs and allows companies to quickly a

rds, front-end processors, and a contextual processor and text layout engine for left to right and right to left language formatting. They have versions tailored to the specifications of mobile devices. 
\par The secret is in generating and processing images (bitmaps), compressing them and transmitting them. In a way, WordWalla generates a FACSIMILE message (the kind we receive on our fax machines) every time text is exchanged. It is transparent to both sender

 defence agency - but it quickly evolved into a network of computers at the service of a community. Academics around the world used 
it to communicate, compare results, compute, interact and flame each other. The ethos of the community as content-creator, source of information, fount of emotional sustenance, peer group, and social substitute is well embedded in the very fabric of the N
e
t. Millions of members in free, advertising or subscription financed, mega-sites such as Geocities, AOL, Yahoo and Tripod generate more bits and bytes than the rest of the Internet combined. This traffic emanates from discussion groups, announcement (mail
ing) lists, newsgroups, and content sites (such as Suite101 and Webseed). Even the occasional visitor can find priceless gems of knowledge and opinion in the mound of trash and frivolity that these parts of the web have become. 
\par The emergence of search engi
nes and directories which cater only to this (sizeable) market segment was to be expected. By far the most comprehensive (and, thus, less discriminating) was Deja. It spidered and took in the exploding newsgroups (Usenet) scene with its tens of thousands 
of daily messages. When it was taken over by Google, its archives contained more than 500 million messages, cross-indexed\~ every which way and pertaining to every possible (and many impossible) a topic. 
\par Google is by far the most popular search engine yet, 
having surpassed the more veteran Northern Lights, Fast, and Alta Vista. Its mind defying database (more than 1.3 billion web pages), its caching technology (making it, in effect, one of the biggest libraries on earth) and its site ranking (by popularity 
a
nd links-over) have rendered it unbeatable. Yet, its efforts to integrate the treasure trove that is Deja and adapt it to the Google search interface have hitherto been spectacularly unsuccessful (though it finally made it two and a half months after the 
purchase). So much so, that it gave birth to a protest movement. 
\par Bickering and bad tempered flaming (often bordering on the deranged, the racial, or the stalking) are the more repulsive aspects of the Usenet groups. But at the heart of the debate this time
 is no ordinary sadistic venting. The issue is: who owns content generated by the public at large on computers funded by tax dollars? Can a commercial enterprise own and monopolize the fruits of the collective effort of millions of individuals from all ov
e
r the world? Or should such intellectual property remain in the public domain, perhaps maintained by public institutions (such as the Library of Congress)? Should open source movements gain access to Deja's source code in order to launch Deja II? And who 
o
wns the copyright to all these messages (theoretically, the authors)? Google, as Deja before it, is offering compilations of this content, the copyright to which it does not and cannot own. The very legal concept of intellectual property is at the crux of
 this virtual conflict. 
\par Google was, thus, compelled to offer free access to the CONTENT of the Deja archives to alternative (non-Google) archiving systems. But it remains mum on the search programming code and the user interface. Already one such open sour
ce group (called Dela News) is coalescing, although it is not clear who will bear the costs of the gigantic storage and processing such a project would require. Dela wants to have a physical copy of the archive deposited in trust with a dot org. 
\par This rais
es a host of no less fascinating subjects. The Deja Usenet search technology, programming code, and systems are inextricable and almost indistinguishable from the Usenet archive itself. Without these elements - structural as well as dynamic - there will b
e
 no archive and no way to extract meaningful information from the chaotic bedlam that is the Usenet environment. In this case, the information lies in the ordering and classification of raw data and not in the content itself. This is why the open source p
roponents demand that Google share both content and the tools to access it. Google's hasty and improvised unplugging of Deja in February only served to aggravate the die-hard fans of erstwhile Deja. 
\par The Usenet is not only the refuge of pedophiles and neo-N
azis. It includes thousands of academically rigorous and research inclined discussion groups which morph with intellectual trends and fashionable subjects. More than twenty years of wisdom and erudition are buried in servers all over the world. Scholars o
f
ten visit Usenet in their pursuit of complementary knowledge or expert advice. The Usenet is also the documentation of Western intellectual history in the last three decades. In it invaluable. Google's decision to abandon the internal links between Deja m
essages means the disintegration of the hyperlinked fabric of this resource - unless Google comes up with an alternative (and expensive) solution. 
\par Google is offering a better, faster, more multi-layered and multi-faceted access to the entire archive. But i
ts brush with the more abrasive side of the open source movement brought to the surface long suppressed issues. This may be the single most important contribution of this otherwise not so opportune transaction. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par At first sight, it appears to be a static, cluttered diagram with multicoloured, overlapping squares. Really, it is an extremely powerfulway of presenting the dynamics of the emerging e-publishing industry. R2 Con
sulting has constructed these eBook Industry Maps to "reflect the evolving business models among publishers, conversion houses, digital distribution companies, eBook vendors, online retailers, libraries, library vendors, authors, and many others.\~
 These ma
ps are 3-dimensionaloffering viewers both a high-level orientation to the eBook landscape and an in-depth look at multiple eBook models and the partnerships that have formed within each one." Pass your mouse over any of the squares and a virtual floodgate
 opens - a universe of interconnected and hyperlinked names, a detailed atlas of who does what to whom. 
\par eBookMap.net is one example of a relatively novel approach to databases and web indexing. The metaphor of cyber-space comes alive in spatial, two and th
ree dimensional map-like representations of the world of knowledge in Cybergeography's online "Atlas". Instead of endless, static and bi-chromatic lists of links - Cybergeography catalogues visual,recombinant vistas with a stunning palette, internal dynam
ics and an intuitively conveyed sense of inter-relatedness. Hyperlinks are incorporated in the topography and topology of these almost-neural maps. 
\par "These maps of Cyberspaces - cybermaps - help us visualise and comprehend the new digital landscapes beyond 
our computer screen, in the wires of the global communications networks and vast online information resources. The cybermaps, like maps of the real-world, help us navigate the new information landscapes, as well being objects of aesthetic interest. They h
a
ve been created by 'cyber-explorers' of many different disciplines, and from all corners of the world. Some of the maps ... in the Atlas of Cyberspaces ... appear familiar, using the cartographicconventions of real-world maps, however, many of the maps ar
e much more abstract representations of electronic spaces, using new metrics and grids." 
\par Navigating these maps is like navigating an inner, familiar, territory. 
\par They come in all shapes and modes: flow charts, quasi-geographical maps, 3-d simulator-like terrains and many others. The "web Stalker" is an experimental web browser which is equipped with mapping functions. The range of applicability is mind boggling.

\par Maps help write fiction, trace a user's clickpath (replete with clickable web sites), capture Usenet and chat interactions (threads), plot search results (though Alta Vista discontinued its mapping s
ervice and Yahoo!3D is no more), bookmark web destinations, and navigate through complex sites. 
\par Different metaphors are used as interface. Web sites are represented as plots of land, stars (whose brightness corresponds to the web site's popularity ranking
), amino-acids in DNA-like constellations,topographical maps of the ocean depths, buildings in an urban landscape, or other objects in a pastoral setting. Virtual Reality (VR) maps allow information to be simultaneously browsed by teams of collaborators, 
s
ometimes represented as avatars in a fully immersive environment. In many applications, the user is expected to fly amongst the data items in virtual landscapes. With the advent of sophisticated GUI's (Graphic UserInterfaces) and VRML (Virtual Reality Mar
kup Language) - these maps may well show us the way to a more colourful and user-friendly future. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid8208409\charrsid16322966

The history of technology is the history of interfaces - their successes and failures. The
 GUI (the Graphic User Interface) - which replaced cumbersome and unwieldy text-based interfaces (DOS) - became an integral part of the astounding success of the PC. 
\par Yet, all computer interfaces hitherto share the same growth-stunting problems. They are:
\par (a) Non-transparency - the workings of the hardware and software (the "plumbing") show through
\par (b) Non-ubiquity - the interface is connected to a specific machine and, thus, is non-transportable
\par (c) Lack of friendliness (i.e., the interfaces require specific knowledge and specific sequences of specific commands).
\par Even the most "user-friendly" interface is way too complicated for the typical user. The average PC is hundreds of times more complicated than your average TV. Even the VCR - far less complex than 
the PC - is a challenge. How many people use the full range of a VCR's options?\line \line The ultimate interface, in my view, should be: 
\par (a) Self-assembling - it should reconstruct itself, from time to time, fluidly
\par (b) Self-recursive - it should be able to observe and analyze its own behavior
\par (c) Learning-capable - it should learn from its experience
\par (d) Self-modifying - it should modify itself according to its accumulated experience
\par (e) History-recording 
\par It must possess a "picture of the world" (a-la artificial intelligence) - preferably including itself, the user, and their cumulative interactions. 
\par It must regard all other "intelligent" machines in its "world"\~ (the user being only one of them) as its "clients". 
\par It must, therefore, be able to communicate with them in a natural language. 
\par Its universe must be seamless (e.g., the physical or even system location of files or hardware or software or applets or servers or communication lines or information and so on - will be irrelevant). 
\par It will probably be peer-orientated (no hierarchy). 
\par I call it "the intuitive universal interface".
\par The new media technologies were designed by engineers and programmers - not by marketing people and users. The interface of the future 
will reflect the needs, wishes, limitations, and skills of users. This is a revolutionary shift and a natural outcome of the takeover of the Internet by governments and bottom line orientated corporations. The interface of the future will seek to enhance 
usage and enrich the user's experience - not to win technological beauty contest. It is a welcome transition - and long overdue.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid8737484\charrsid16322966

lleled by a similar trend in print advertising - had more serious and irreversible implications. Most content dot.coms were based on ad-driven revenue models. Online advertising was supposed to amortize start-up and operational costs and lead to profitabi
lity even as it subsidized free access to costly content. 
\par A similar revenue model has been successfully propping up print periodicals for at least two centuries. But, as opposed to their online counterparts, print products have a few streams of income, not least among them paid subscriptions. 
\par Moreover, print media kept their costs down in good times and bad. Dot.coms devoured their investors' money in a self-destructive and avaricious bacchanalia. 
\par But why did online advertising collapse in the first place? Was it ineffective?
\par Advertising is a multi-faceted and psychologically complex phenomenon. It imparts information to potential consumers, users, suppliers, investors, the community, or other stakeholders in the firm. It motivates each of these to do his 
bit: consumers to consume, investors to invest and so on. 
\par But this is not the main function of the advertising dollar. Modern economic signal theory has cast advertising in a new and surprising - though by no means counterintuitive - light. 
\par According to 
this theory, the role of advertising is to signal to the marketplace the advertiser's resilience, longevity, wealth, clout, and dominance. By splurging money of advertising, the advertiser actually informs us - the "eyeballs" - that it is here to stay, su
fficiently affluent to finance its ads, stable, reliable, and dominant. 
\par "If firm X invested a million bucks in advertising - it must be worth more than a million bucks" - goes the signal. "If it invested so much money in promoting its products, it is not a
 fly-by-night". "If it can throw money at an ad campaign, it is stable and resilient".
\par This signal is missing in online advertising. It drowns in noise. The online noise to signal ratio was unacceptable to advertisers - so they stopped advertising. When th
e noise to signal ratio tops a certain level - ads cease to be effective. The readers or spectators become inured to the messages - both explicit and implicit. They tune off. 
\par The noise in online advertising stems from two sources.
\par A critical element in th
e signal is lost if the ad is not paid for. Only paid advertising conveys information about the purported health and prospects of the advertiser. Yet, the Internet is flooded with free advertising: free classifieds, free banner ads, ad exchanges. The paid
 ads drown in this ocean of free ads. There is often no way of telling a paid ad from a free one - without reading the fine print.
\par Moreover, Internet users are a "captive audience". It is easy to flip ad-besieged channels on TV, or turn the ad-laden leaf of
 a newspaper. It is close to impossible to avoid an ad on the Net. Banner ads are an integral part of the page. Pop-up ads pop up. Embedded ads are embedded. One needs to install special applications to avoid the harassment. 
\par This leads to desensitization 
and a revolt of the user. Users resent the intrusion, are incensed by the coercive tactics of advertisers, nerve wrecked by protracted download times, and unnerved by the content of many of the ads. This is not an environment conducive to clinching deals 
or converting to sales.
\par There is also the issue of credibility. The bulk of online advertising emanates from dot.coms. Even prior to the recent stock exchange meltdown, these were not considered paragons of rectitude and truth in advertising. People learned
 to distrust most of what they read in Internet ads. Scorched by scams, false promises, faulty products, shoddy or non-existent customer care, broken links, or all of the above - users learned to ignore Web advertising and relegate it to their mental dust
 bins.

 resident K. C. "Khan" Smith owes the internet service provider EarthLink $24 million. According to the CNN, last August he was slapped with a lawsuit accusing him of violating federal and state Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) sta
tutes, the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984, the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 and numerous other state laws. On July 19 - having failed to appear in court - the judge ruled against him. Mr. Smith is a spammer.
\par Brightmail
, a vendor of e-mail filters and anti-spam applications warned that close to 5 million spam "attacks" or "bursts" occurred last month and that spam has mushroomed 450 percent since June last year. PC World concurs. Between one seventh and one half of all 
e
-mail messages are spam - unsolicited and intrusive commercial ads, mostly concerned with sex, scams, get rich quick schemes, financial services and products, and health articles of dubious provenance. The messages are sent from spoofed or fake e-mail add
resses. Some spammers hack into unsecured servers - mainly in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}China{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Korea
{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} - to relay their missives anonymously.
\par Spam is an industry. Mass e-mailers maintain lists of e-mail addresses, often "harvested" by spamware 
bots - specialized computer applications - from Web sites. These lists are rented out or sold to marketers who use bulk mail services. They come cheap - c. $100 for 10 million addresses. Bulk mailers provide servers and bandwidth, charging c. $300 per mil
lion messages sent. 
\par As spam recipients become more inured, ISP's less tolerant, and both more litigious - spammers multiply their efforts in order to maintain the same response rate. Spam works. It is not universally unwanted - which makes it tricky to out
law. It elicits between 0.1 and 1 percent in positive follow ups, depending on the message. Many messages now include HTML, JavaScript, and ActiveX coding and thus resemble viruses. 
\par Jupiter Media Matrix predicted last year that the number of spam messages
 annually received by a typical Internet user is bound to double to 1400 and spending on legitimate e-mail marketing will reach $9.4 billion by 2006 - compared to $1 billion in 2001. Forrester Research pegs the number at $4.8 billion next year. 
\par More than 
2.3 billion spam messages are sent daily. eMarketer puts the figures a lot lower at 76 billion messages this year. By 2006, daily spam output will soar to c. 15 billion missives, says Radicati Group. Jupiter projects a more modest 268 billion annual messa
ges by 2005. An average communication costs the spammer 0.00032 cents. 
\par PC World quotes the European Union as pegging the bandwidth costs of spam worldwide at $8-10 billion annually. Other damages include server crashes, time spent purging unwanted messages
, lower productivity, aggravation, and increased cost of Internet access.
\par Inevitably, the spam industry gave rise to an anti-spam industry. According to a Radicati Group report titled "Anti-virus, anti-spam, and content filtering market trends 2002-2006", 
anti-spam revenues are projected to exceed $88 million this year - and more than double by 2006. List blockers, report and complaint generators, advocacy groups, registers of known spammers, and spam filters all proliferate. The Wall Street Journal report
ed in its June 25 issue about a resurgence of anti-spam startups financed by eager venture capital.
\par ISP's are bent on preventing abuse - reported by victims - by expunging the accounts of spammers. But the latter simply switch ISP's or sign on with free ser
vices like Hotmail and Yahoo! Barriers to entry are getting lower by the day as the costs of hardware, software, and communications plummet.
\par The use of e-mail and broadband connections by the general population is spreading. Hundreds of thousands of techno
logically-savvy operators have joined the market in the last two years, as the dotcom bubble burst. Still, Steve Linford of the UK-based Spamhaus.org insists that most spam emanates from c. 80 large operators.
\par Now, according to Jupiter Media, ISP's and por
tals are poised to begin to charge advertisers in a tier-based system, replete with premium services. Writing back in 1998, Bill Gates described a solution also espoused by Esther Dyson, chair of the Electronic Frontier Foundation:
\par "As I first described in my book "}{\rtlch \ai\af0 \ltrch \i\insrsid1454662\charrsid16322966 The Road Ahead" }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid1454662\charrsid16322966 
in 1995, I expect that eventually you'll be paid to read unsolicited e-mail. You'll tell your e-mail program to discard all unsolicited messages that don't offer an amount of money that you'll choose. If you open a paid message an
d discover it's from a long-lost friend or somebody else who has a legitimate reason to contact you, you'll be able to cancel the payment. Otherwise, you'll be paid for your time."
\par Subscribers may not be appreciative of the joint ventures between gatekeepe
rs and inbox clutterers. Moreover, dominant ISP's, such as AT&T and PSINet have recurrently been accused of knowingly collaborating with spammers. ISP's rely on the data traffic that spam generates for their revenues in an ever-harsher business environmen
t. 
\par The Financial Times and others described how WorldCom refuses to ban the sale of spamware over its network, claiming that it does not regulate content. When "pink" (the color of canned spam) contracts came to light, the implicated ISP's blame the whole 
affair on rogue employees. 
\par PC World begs to differ:
\par "Ronnie Scelson, a self-described spammer who signed such a contract with PSInet, (says) that backbone providers are more than happy to do business with bulk e-mailers. 'I've signed up with the biggest 5
0 carriers two or three times,' says Scelson ... The Louisiana-based spammer claims to send 84 million commercial e-mail messages a day over his three 45-megabit-per-second DS3 circuits. "If you were getting $40,000 a month for each circuit," Scelson asks
, "would you want to shut me down?"}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid15165458\charrsid16322966

\par The line between permission-based or "opt-in" e-mail marketing and spam is getting thinner by the day. Some list resellers guarantee the consensual nature of their wares. According to the Direct Marketing Association's 
guidelines, quoted by PC World, not responding to an unsolicited e-mail amounts to "opting-in" - a marketing strategy known as "opting out". Most experts, though, strongly urge spam victims not to respond to spammers, lest their e-mail address is confirme
d.
\par But spam is crossing technological boundaries. {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Japan{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 has just legislated against wireless SMS spam targeted at hapless mobile phone users. Four states in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 as well as the European parliament are following suit. Expensive and slow connections make this kind of spam particularly resented. Still, according to {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Britain{\*\xmlclose}
{\*\xmlclose}'s Mobile Channel, a mobile advertising company quoted by "The Economist", SMS advertising - a novelty - attracts a 10-20 percent response rate - compared to direct mail's 1-3 percent.
\par Net identification systems - like Microsoft's Passport and the one proposed by Liberty Alliance - will make it even easier for marketers to target prospects. 
\par The reaction to spam can be described only a
s mass hysteria. Reporting someone as a spammer - even when he is not - has become a favorite pastime of vengeful, self-appointed, vigilante "cyber-cops". Perfectly legitimate, opt-in, email marketing businesses often find themselves in one or more black 
lists - their reputation and business ruined. 
\par In January, CMGI-owned Yesmail was awarded a temporary restraining order against MAPS - Mail Abuse Prevention System - forbidding it to place the reputable e-mail marketer on its Real-time Blackhole list. The case was settled out of court. 
\par Harris Interactive, a large online opinion polling company, sued not only MAPS, but ISP's who blocked its email messages when it found itself included in MAPS' Blackhole. Their CEO accused one of their competitors for the all
egations that led to Harris' inclusion in the list.
\par Coupled with other pernicious phenomena, such as viruses, the very foundation of the Internet as a fun, relatively safe, mode of communication and data acquisition is at stake. 
\par Spammers, it emerges, have
 their own organizations. NOIC - the National Organization of Internet Commerce threatened to post to its Web site the e-mail addresses of millions of AOL members. AOL has aggressive anti-spamming policies. "AOL is blocking bulk email because it wants the
 advertising revenues for itself (by selling pop-up ads)" the president of NOIC, Damien Melle, complained to CNET.
\par Spam is a classic "free rider" problem. For any given individual, the cost of blocking a spammer far outweighs the benefits. It is cheaper and
 easier to hit the "delete" key. Individuals, therefore, prefer to let others do the job and enjoy the outcome - the public good of a spam-free Internet. They cannot be left out of the benefits of such an aftermath - public goods are, by definition, "non-
excludable". Nor is a public good diminished by a growing number of "non-rival" users.
\par Such a situation resembles a market failure and requires government intervention through legislation and enforcement. The FTC - the US Federal Trade Commission - has take
n legal action against more than 100 spammers for promoting scams and fraudulent goods and services. 
\par "Project Mailbox" is an anti-spam collaboration between American law enforcement agencies and the private sector. Non government organizations have entere
d the fray, as have lobbying groups, such as CAUCE - the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-mail.
\par But Congress is curiously reluctant to enact stringent laws against spam. Reasons cited are free speech, limits on state powers to regulate commerce, 
avoiding unfair restrictions on trade, and the interests of small business. The courts equivocate as well. In some cases - e.g., {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Missouri{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 vs. American Blast Fax - {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}US{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} courts found "that the provision prohibiting the sending of unsolicited advertisements is unconstitutional". 
\par According to Spamlaws.com,\~ the 107th Congress discussed these laws but never enacted them: 
\par Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail Act of 2001 (H.R. 95), Wirel
ess Telephone Spam Protection Act (H.R. 113), Anti-Spamming Act of 2001 (H.R. 718), Anti-Spamming Act of 2001 (H.R. 1017), Who Is E-Mailing Our Kids Act (H.R. 1846), Protect Children From E-Mail Smut Act of 2001 (H.R.\~
 2472), Netizens Protection Act of 2001 (H.R. 3146), "CAN SPAM" Act of 2001 (S. 630).
\par Anti-spam laws fared no better in the 106th Congress. Some of the states have picked up the slack. Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Mi
nnesota, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.
\par The situation is no better across the pond. The European parliament decided last year to all
ow each member country to enact its own spam laws, thus avoiding a continent-wide directive and directly confronting the communications ministers of the union. Paradoxically, it also decided, three months ago, to restrict SMS spam. Confusion clearly reign

This dramatically changed how business was conducted, but was limited to those areas where voice could make a difference.\~ 
\par \~
\par Similarly, now that most business operations and knowledge work are conducted in the digital domain via computers, and because we now have a global data communications network (the Interne
t) which does not restrict the type of data shared (voice, documents, real-time collaboration, videoconferencing, video-on-demand, print-on-demand, and even the creation of physical 3D prototype elements at a distance from insubstantial CAD files), busine
ss is changing yet again.\line \line Knowledge workers can now work where they wish to, rather than be subject to the old restrictions of physical proximity, which can change the concept of cities and suburbs.\~
 Virtual teams can spring up and dissipate as needed without regard to geography or time zones.\~
 Indeed, as bandwidth continues to increase in availability and plummet in cost, entire industries, such as the "call center," are finding a global marketplace that could not have existed before.\~ 
\par \~
\par Example: U.S. firms whose "800 numbers" are actually answered by American-sounding representatives who are working in India, and U.S. firms who are outsourcing "back office" operations to other countries with well-educated but lower-paid workforces.\line 
\line Indiv
iduals can now afford Internet data connections that just a few years ago were the expensive province of large corporations (e.g., cable modem and DSL service). As these technologies improve, and as fiber is eventually extended "to the curb," many industr
ies, some not yet invented, will find ways to profitably consume this new resource.\~ We always find innovative ways to consume available resources.\line \~
\par D) "Combinational Sciences."\~ More than any one or two individual technologies, I believe that the combinat
ion and resulting synergy of multiple technologies will have the most dramatic and far-reaching effects on our societies. For example, completing the human genome could not have taken place at all, much less years earlier than expected, without 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Moore{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}'s Law of computing.\~ 
\par \~
\par And now the second stage of what will be a biological and medical revolution, "Proteomics", will be further driven by advances in computing.\~ But in a synergistic way, computing may actually be driven by advances in biology whic
h are making it possible, as scientists learn more about DNA and other organic molecules, to use them as the basis for certain types of computing!\line \line Other examples of "combination sciences" that synergistically build on one another include:

\par \~
\par - Materials science and computing. For instance: carbon nanotubes, in some ways the results of our abilities to work at the molecular level due to computing research, are far stronger than steel and may lead to new materials with exceptional qualities.}{

\par - Medicine, biology, and materials science. For example, the use of transgenic goats to produce specialized "building materials" such as large quantities of spider silk in their milk, as is being done by Nexia Biotechnologies.\line \~
\par - "Molecular Manufacturing."\~ As offshoo
ts of much of the above research, scientists are learning how to coerce molecules to automatically form the structures they need, rather than by having to painstakingly push or prod these tiny building blocks into the correct places.\~ \line \line 
The bottom line is that the real power of the next decades will be in the combination and synergy of previously separate fields.\~
 And this will impact not only industries, but the education process as well, as it becomes apparent that people with broad, "cross-field" knowledge will be the ones to recognize the new synergistic opportunities and benefit from them.

Twenty years ago, at the time of the bir

he building blocks that people innovate with can be far more complex than those in the past. You can create a more interesting innovation out of an integrated circuit that contains 42-million transistors today - a Pentium 4 - than you could out of a few s

City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Texas{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} wants to collect a royalty every time someone
 compresses an image using the JPEG algorithm. It urges third parties to negotiate with it separate licensing agreements. It bases its claim on a 17 year old patent it acquired in 1997 when VTel, from which Forgent was spun-off, purchased the San-Jose bas
ed Compression Labs. 
\par The patent pertains to a crucial element in the popular compression method. The JPEG committee of ISO - the International Standards Organization - threatens to withdraw the standard altogether. This would impact thousands of software a
nd hardware products.
\par This is only the latest in a serious of spats. Unisys has spent the better part of the last 15 years trying to enforce a patent it owns for a compression technique used in two other popular imaging standards, GIF and TIFF. BT Group su
ed Prodigy, a unit of SBC Communications, in a {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}US{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 federal court, for infringement of its patent of the hypertext link, or hyperlink - a ubiquitous and critical element of the Web. Dell Computer has agreed with the FTC to refrain from enf
orcing a graphics patent having failed to disclose it to the standards committee in its deliberations of the VL-bus graphics standard.
\par "Wired" reported yesterday that the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Munich Upper Court{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} declared "deep linking" - posting links to specific p
ages within a Web site - in violation the European Union "Database Directive". The directive copyrights the "selection and arrangement" of a database - even if the content itself is not owned by the database creator. It explicitly prohibits hyperlinking t
o the database contents as "unfair extraction". If upheld, this would cripple most search engines. Similar rulings - based on national laws - were handed down in other countries, the latest being {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}Denmark{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. 
\par Amazon sued Barnes and Noble - a
nd has since settled out of court in March - for emulating its patented "one click purchasing" business process. A Web browser command to purchase an item generates a "cookie" - a text file replete with the buyer's essential details which is then lodged i
n Amazon's server. This allows the transaction to be completed without a further confirmation step.
\par \page 
\par A clever trick, no doubt. But even Jeff Bezos, Amazon's legendary founder, expressed doubts regarding the wisdom of the US Patent Office in granting his co
mpany the patent. In an open letter to Amazon's customers, he called for a rethinking of the whole system of protection of intellectual property in the Internet age.
\par In a recently published discourse of innovation and property rights, titled "The Free-Market Innovation Machine", William Baumol of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Princeton{\*\xmlclose} {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}University{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} claims that only capitalism guarantees growth through a steady flow of innovation. According to popular lore, capitalism makes sure that innovators are rewarded for their
 time and skills since property rights are enshrined in enforceable contracts. 
\par Reality is different, as Baumol himself notes. Innovators tend to maximize their returns by sharing their technology and licensing it to more efficient and profitable manufactu
rers. This rational division of labor is hampered by the increasingly more stringent and expansive intellectual property laws that afflict many rich countries nowadays. These statutes tend to protect the interests of middlemen - manufacturers, distributor
s, marketers - rather than the claims of inventors and innovators. 
\par Moreover, the very nature of "intellectual property" is in flux. Business processes and methods, plants, genetic material, strains of animals, minor changes to existing technologies - are a
ll patentable. Trademarks and copyright now cover contents, brand names, and modes of expression and presentation. Nothing is safe from these encroaching juridical initiatives. Intellectual property rights have been transformed into a myriad pernicious mo
nopolies which threaten to stifle innovation and competition.
\par Intellectual property - patents, content libraries, copyrighted material, trademarks, rights of all kinds - are sometimes the sole assets - and the only hope for survival - of cash-strapped and o
therwise dysfunctional or bankrupt firms. Both managers and court-appointed receivers strive to monetize these properties and patent-portfolios by either selling them or enforcing the rights against infringing third parties. 
\par Fighting a patent battle in co
urt is prohibitively expensive and the outcome uncertain. Potential defendants succumb to extortionate demands rather than endure the Kafkaesque process. The costs are passed on to the consumer. Sony, for instance already paid Forgent an undisclosed amoun
t in May. According to Forgent's 10-Q form, filed on {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}June 17, 2002{\*\xmlclose}, yet another, unidentified "prestigious international" company, parted with $15 million in April. 
\par In commentaries written in 1999-2000 by Harvard law professor, Lawrence Lessig, for "The Industry Standard", he observed:
\par "There is growing skepticism among academics about whether such state-imposed monopolies help a rapidly evolving market such as the Internet. What is "novel," "nonobvious" or "useful" is hard enough to 
know in a relatively stable field. In a transforming market, it's nearly impossible..."
\par The very concept of intellectual property is being radically transformed by the onslaught of new technologies.
\par The myth of intellectual property postulates that entrepr
eneurs assume the risks associated with publishing books, recording records, and inventing only because - and where - the rights to intellectual property are well defined and enforced. In the absence of such rights, creative people are unlikely to make th
eir works accessible to the public. Ultimately, it is the public which pays the price of piracy and other violations of intellectual property rights, goes the refrain. 
\par This is untrue. In the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} only few authors actually live by their pe
n. Even fewer musicians, not to mention actors, eke out subsistence level income from their craft.\~
 Those who do can no longer be considered merely creative people. Madonna, Michael Jackson, Schwarzenegger and Grisham are businessmen at least as much as they are artists. 
\par Intellectual property is a relatively new notion. In the near past, no one considered knowledge or the fruits of creativity (artwork, designs) as 'patentable', or as someone's 'property'. The artist was but a mere channel through which div
ine grace flowed. Texts, discoveries, inventions, works of art and music, designs - all belonged to the community and could be replicated freely. True, the chosen ones, the conduits, were revered. But they were rarely financially rewarded. 
\par Well into the 1
9th century, artists and innovators were commissioned - and salaried - to produce their works of art and contrivances. The advent of the Industrial Revolution - and the imagery of the romantic lone inventor toiling on his brainchild in a basement or, late
r, a garage -\~ gave rise to the patent. The more massive the markets became, the more sophisticated the sales and marketing techniques, the bigger the financial stakes - the larger loomed the issue of intellectual property. 
\par Intellectual property rights are
 less about the intellect and more about property. In every single year of the last decade, the global turnover in intellectual property has outweighed the total industrial production of the world. These markets being global, the monopolists of intellectu
al products fight unfair competition globally. A pirate in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Skopje{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 is in direct rivalry with Bill Gates, depriving Microsoft of present and future revenue, challenging its monopolistic status as well as jeopardizing its competition-deterring image. 
\par The Open Source Movement weakens the classic model of property rights by presenting an alternative, viable, vibrant, model which does not involve over-pricing and anti-competitive predatory practices. The current model of property rights encourages monopo
listic behavior, non-collaborative, exclusionary innovation (as opposed, for instance, to Linux), and litigiousness. The Open Source movement exposes the myths underlying current property rights philosophy and is thus subversive.
\par But the inane expansion of
 intellectual property rights may merely be a final spasm, threatened by the ubiquity of the Internet as they are. Free scholarly online publications nibble at the heels of their pricey and anticompetitive offline counterparts. Electronic publishing poses
 
a threat - however distant - to print publishing. Napster-like peer to peer networks undermine the foundations of the music and film industries. Open source software is encroaching on the turf of proprietary applications. It is very easy and cheap to publ
ish and distribute content on the Internet, the barriers to entry are virtually nil. 
\par As processors grow speedier, storage larger, applications multi-featured, broadband access all-pervasive, and the Internet goes wireless - individuals are increasingly abl
e to emulate much larger scale organizations successfully. A single person, working from home, with less than $2000 worth of equipment - can publish a Webzine, author software, write music, shoot digital films, design products, or communicate with million
s and his work will be indistinguishable from the offerings of the most endowed corporations and institutions. 
\par Obviously, no individual can yet match the capital assets, the marketing clout, the market positioning, the global branding, the sales organizati
on, and the distribution network of the likes of Sony, or Microsoft. In an age of information glut, it is still the marketing, the media campaign, the distribution, and the sales that determine the economic outcome. 
\par This advantage, however, is also being eroded, albeit glacially. 
\par The Internet is essentially a free marketing and - in the case of digital goods - distribution channel. It directly reaches 200 million people all over the world. Even with a minimum invest
ment, the likelihood of being seen by surprisingly large numbers of consumers is high. Various business models are emerging or reasserting themselves - from ad sponsored content to packaged open source software. 
\par Many creative people - artists, authors, in
novators - are repelled by the commercialization of their intellect and muse. They seek - and find - alternatives to the behemoths of manufacturing, marketing and distribution that today control the bulk of intellectual property. Many of them go freelance
. Indie music labels, independent cinema, print on demand publishing - are omens of things to come.
\par This inexorably leads to disintermediation - the removal of middlemen between producer or creator and consumer. The Internet enables niche marketing and rest
ores the balance between the creative genius and the commercial exploiters of his product. This is a return to pre-industrial times when artisans ruled the economic scene. 
\par Work mobility increases in this landscape of shifting allegiances, head hunting, re
mote collaboration, contract and agency work, and similar labour market trends. Intellectual property is likely to become as atomized as labor and to revert to its true owners - the inspired folks. They, in turn, will negotiate licensing deals directly wi
th their end users and customers. 
\par Capital, design, engineering, and labor intensive goods - computer chips, cruise missiles, and passenger cars - will still necessitate the coordination of a massive workforce in multiple locations. But even here, in the ol
d industrial landscape, the intellectual contribution to the collective effort will likely be outsourced to roving freelancers who will maintain an ownership stake in their designs or inventions.
\par This intimate relationship between creative person and consu
mer is the way it has always been. We may yet look back on the 20th century and note with amazement the transient and aberrant phase of intermediation - the Sony's, Microsoft's, and Forgent's of this world.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

Q. How did you come to write the book and why now? This isn't exactly the heyday of IT!}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966

 I've been in the IT profession for a little over 21 years. During this time I've seen a huge number of stellar IT individual contributors promoted into IT management roles where they began a steady descent in performance and confidence that brought pa
in to themselves, their teams, and their company. When I looked around for books that addressed these IT management challenges, I found that none of them dealt with the possibility that the role might be the wrong one for the individual (e.g., not their t
alent). 
\par \~
\par I think that it is important to make sure that the individual has the proper talent, desire and willingness to be an IT manager in a specific role before we leap to training and other development interventions. Also, many of the books dedicated t
o IT management seem to focus on "project-management" skills or "Tayloristic" productivity measurement approaches. Project management and reading metrics are important, but are not the only skills needed to be an effective manager.
\par \~
\par One of my personal mot
ivations for engaging in this project with Jim was to provide IT professionals as well as Human Resource and Performance Consultants working with IT professionals with a tool that would do two things. First, enable the IT professional considering a role i
n management to determine if this is the right career move and, if it is, to provide them with a basic foundation of key IT management skills.
\par \~

quite successful self-help books, delivered countless seminars, and worked with individuals and groups to help them identify the blockages to their growth and create strategies to move toward their goals. My main contribution to this book is in helping pe
ople identify their personal goals and values and applying them to their careers.
\par \~
\par \page If a person is working out of alignment with his high driving values, no amount of promotion or money will satisfy him or her. Such people are continually unhappy, unfulfil
led and less than stellar performers. In "Manage IT" we have provided a series of exercises to assist people to identify their own goals and values and then determine if they are in alignment with the specific management position being considered. We've a
lso provided the IT manager with coaching tools and strategies that they can use to elicit peak performance and results from their teams.

\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 Q. Why is there a gap between corporate management and IT management? What went wrong, what are the historical roots of this misunderstanding?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 
\par \~
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 Joe:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966  IT people that grew up writing programs or keeping computers and networks running have typically not been exposed to company s
trategy and objectives early in their careers. On the other hand, their "cousins" in marketing, sales and operations - often promoted to become corporate - were either directly part of the "core business action" or at least close enough to witness it. 

\par \~
\par A
 lot of effort is going into closing this gap, by pioneering innovators such as Dr. Howard Rubin, executive vice president and board member of META Group. One model developed by Dr. Rubin, the IT Investment Portfolio Model, creates what he calls a "univer
sal translator" between the language of IT and Corporate Management. 
\par \~
\par In essence, Dr. Rubin teaches IT executives to look at their IT dollars as part of an investment fund and to regard themselves as fund and portfolio managers whose goal is to allocate i
nvestments in a manner that supports their company's overall business strategy. The model is an excellent tool that enables the IT function to link and drive technology investment decisions to conform to the company's business strategy. We make extensive 
use of this model in one chapter of the book.

Q. A growing school of economists study the "Solow Paradox". It seems that the introduction of IT has little effect of workplace productivity. From your experience, in what ways does IT change the workplace and render it more productive?}{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch \insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966

 Assessing the impact of IT on productivity solely on the basis of statistical models that focus on the aggregate of numerical indicators reminds me of a story I once heard about a weatherman who denied the presence of a 
storm he saw out his window because his instruments indicated clear skies with a light breeze. 
\par \~
\par The impact of technology in driving up individual and team productivity can be seen in any office today where hundreds of people share information in a presen
tation delivered online, without leaving their desks. Unfortunately unless these individual and team productivity improvements are focused on specific areas that enhance the aggregate economic productivity of the company, they do not show up on the statis
tical charts.
\par \~
\par To have a greater impact on these macroeconomic statistics, IT investments need to be better aligned with company business goals. If a company is in a business where measured productivity is highly dependent on a well automated point of sale
 strategy, but it is investing a large portion of its IT dollars in providing computer maintenance services, the impact of IT dollar investments on the company's productivity will be low. 
\par \~
\par On the other hand, if said company were to shift its investments 
from the maintenance process to improving the point-of-sale automation tools, the impact on overall company productivity would be greater. Unfortunately, according to studies by the likes of the META Group, the number of organizations where IT is well-ali
gned with business objectives - and thus highly impacts productivity - is still relatively low.
\par \~
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 Jim: }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 
One of the things we've done in "Manage IT" is to give the new or aspiring IT manager tools they can use to better understand their role within the corpor
ation and how they fit into the "big picture." Seeing this "big picture" enables managers to focus-lead their teams performance in a manner that contributes to corporate productivity.
\par \~
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 Q. Should IT functions be outsourced - or is an in-house department the best - and cost-effective - solution?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 
\par \~
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 Joe: }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 
The best solution is a hybrid approach. Keep only those things that are key to the enterprise's competitive differentiation and outsource everything else.
\par \~
\par For example, if a company's strategy is heavily pred
icated on its success as a provider of a unique mobile commerce solution, they should be looking at mobile commerce development as a strategic differentiator and should internally own this function. They may use consultants to work on various aspects as n
eeded, but for the most part they would want to own the development of this process which is going to yield them a strategic advantage. 
\par \~
\par On the other hand, basic commodity services such as the help desk, maintenance & repair, and general network administr
ation are not strategic differentiators. These functions are simply needed to run the business, just like telephone repair and paying insurance. 
\par \~
\par Furthermore, these functions can be performed more cheaply and more qualitatively by suppliers that leverage their investments across millions of transactions versus the thousands generated by even the largest enterprises. If an enterprise is seeking cost
-savings or to free up funds and reallocate them to more strategic projects that will positively impact productivity, outsourcing all commodity, non-core services is the best solution. 
\par \~
\par While outsourcing may scare many IT people, the fact is that being an
 IT person in a company that outsources certain IT functions presents a number of great career opportunities for IT people. In our book we actually have a chapter where we outline how IT people can turn outsourcing into a positive.
\par .
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 Jim:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966  One of our goals 
in the book is to help new managers become more innovative in their approach, so that instead of standing in the way of strategic corporate changes they learn how to harness these and create win-win situations.
\par \~
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 \page Q. IT personnel are widely perceived to be highly mobile, forever head-hunted, types with little corporate loyalty. Is this true? Should firms invest in training such cadre?}{\rtlch 
\af0 \ltrch \insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 
\par \~
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 Joe:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966  I don't think companies can even attract good IT people if they cease to invest in training, so that's not an option.
 The issue is not lack of loyalty of IT professionals as much as lack of career opportunities offered by enterprises-employers in many IT professional roles.
\par \~
\par Companies will have to develop opportunities for growth in areas that are key to their business 
strategy. IT positions in these areas should have a growth path. Companies generally do not have a career path for non-key areas. For example: unless the company is in the computer maintenance field, where a repair technician can move up the ladder and be
come say a manager and from there a director of repair services, a computer repair technician would not generally have much of a career path. 
\par \~
\par IT people who have positions in companies where opportunities for personal growth are limited are more receptive
 to headhunters and/or seeking the next career opportunity elsewhere. But the same could be said of any highly skilled professional facing an artificial career ceiling.
\par \~
\par The question is how can a company make sure that it is hiring and investing in IT pro
fessionals who stick around long enough for the company to reap some rewards? If a firm offers no career growth opportunity for a given position, then it should be outsourced and the company should avoid the headache and expense of hiring and investments 
that result in benefits that they never reap.
\par \~
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 Jim:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 
 We devote an entire chapter to "getting to know your people." In it we offer several ways in which managers can learn best ways to motivate their people and keep them actively involved in the company's ov
erall objectives. We offer suggestions for developing staff members, which in turn, reduce turnover. Companies which invest in training and coaching experience higher productivity and lower turnover than those who do not.
\par \~
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 Q. Should IT managers also be IT experts - or are general management skills sufficient? Can you provide us with a profile of the "ideal" IT manager?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 
\par \~
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 Joe:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966  I don't think there is a single "ideal" IT Manager profile. "Ideal" really depends on what the specific manager manages (e.g., a sof
tware development team, a help desk, etcetera) and the role the company expects the manager to play. The best way is to:
\par \~
\par * Identify the outcomes expected from the role
\par * Determine what the person needs to do to reach those outcomes
\par * Determine the talent, desire and willingness profile of the person required to perform the duties required by the role
\par \~
\par The {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Gallup{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} studies reveal that highly effective managers are great organizers of people and resources. They remove obstacles and thus increase tea
m productivity and they know how to recognize, make the best use of, and develop their people's talents.
\par \~
\par \page IT managers need to have a mixture of IT and general management skills. That does
 not mean that the IT manager has to be an expert (although some employers may expect and want this), but rather that he needs to understand the "technical context" of the work performed by the team in order to provide them with the support and direction 
they expect.
\par \~
\par As IT continues to become inter-woven into the fabric of every business, the decisions concerning the allocation of IT investments and the quality of IT management as well as the ability of IT management to secure and maintain strong alignmen
t with the objectives of the enterprise are becoming even more critical to business success. Companies that fail to fine-tune this area will find themselves in an increasingly difficult competitive position relative to their better-aligned competitors.

\par \~
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 Jim: }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid7343195\charrsid16322966 
Agreed. The future belongs to those companies which understand that their true asset is their human capital and which invest in their employees. Study after study have confirmed that every "smart" dollar invested in employees results in increased perfo
rmance, higher morale, less turnover and absenteeism and an overall increase in the growth of the company.
\par By integrating all aspects of the business, including IT, companies become well positioned for growth into the twenty first century.

\af0 \ltrch \insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 These metaphors prove to be very useful (even business-wise). They permit us to define the commercial opportunities embedded in the Internet. 
\par Yet, they fail to assist us in predicting its future in its transformation into a medium. 
\par How does an invention become a medium? What happens to it when it does become one? What is the thin line separating the initial functioning of the invention from its transformation into
 a new medium? In other words: when can we tell that some technological advance gave birth to a new medium? 
\par This work also deals with the image of the Internet once transformed into a medium. 
\par The Internet has the most unusual attributes in the history of media. 
\par It has no central structure or organization. It is hardware and software independent. It (almost) cannot be subjected to legislation or to regulation. Consider the example of downloading music from the internet - is it tantamount to an act of reco
rding music (a violation of copyright laws)? This has been the crux of the legal battle between Diamond Multimedia (the manufacturers of the Rio MP3 device), MP3.com and Napster and the recording industry in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}America{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. 
\par The Internet's data
 transfer channels are not linear - they are random. Most of its "broadcast" cannot be "received" at all. It allows for the narrowest of narrowcasting through the use of e-mail mailing lists, discussion groups, message boards, private radio stations, and 
chats. And this is but a small portion of an impressive list of oddities. These idiosyncrasies will also shape the nature of the Internet as a medium. Growing out of bizarre roots - it is bound to yield strange fruit as a medium. 
\par So what business opportunities does the Internet represent?

\par How many Internet users are there? How many of them have access to the Web (World Wide Web - WWW) and use it? There are no unequivocal statistics. Those who presume to give the answers (including the ISOC - the Internet SOCiety) - rely on very partial and
 biased resources. Others just bluff. 
\par Yet, everyone seems to agree that there are, at least, 100 million active participants in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}North America{\*\xmlclose} (the Nielsen and Commerce-Net reports). 
\par The future is, inevitably, even more vague than the present. Authori
tative consultancy firms predict 66 million active users in 10 years time. IBM envisages 700 million users. MCI is more modest with 300 million. At the end of 1999 there were 130 million registered (though not necessarily active) users.

\par The average user of the Internet is young (30), with an academic background and high income. The percentage of the educated and the well-to-do among the users of the Web is three times as high as their proportion in the pop
ulation. This is fast changing only because their children are joining them (6 million already had access to the Internet at the end of 1996 - and were joined by another 24 million by the end of the decade). This may change only due to presidential initia
tives to bridge the "digital divide" (from Al Gore's in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} to Mahatir Mohammed's in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1

{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
). These efforts will spread the benefits of this all-powerful tool among the less privileged. A bit less than 50% of all users are men but they are responsible for 60% of the activity in the net (as measured by traffic). 
\par Women seem to limit themselves to electronic mail (e-mail) and to electronic shopping of goods and services, though this is changing fast. Men prefer information, either due to career requirements or because knowledge is power. 
\par Most of the users are of the "experiencer" vari
ety. They are leaders of social change and innovative. This breed inhabits universities, fashionable neighbourhoods and trendy vocations. This is why some wonder if the Internet is not just another fad, albeit an incredibly resilient and promising one. 

\par Mo
st users have home access to the Internet - yet, they still prefer to access it from work, at their employer's expense, though this preference is slight and being eroded. Most users are, therefore, exploitative in nature. Still, we must not forget that th
ere are 37 million households of the self-employed and this possibly distorts the statistical picture somewhat.

\par Most computer owners still possess a 28,800 bps modem. This is much like driving a bicycle on a Ge
rman Autobahn. The 56,600 bps is gradually replacing its slower predecessor (48% of computers with modems) - but even this is hardly sufficient. To begin to enjoy video and audio (especially the former) - data transfer rates need to be 50 times faster. 

\par Half the households in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} have at least 2 telephones and one of them is usually dedicated to data processing (faxes or fax-modems). 
\par The ISDN could constitute the mid-term solution. This data transfer network is fairly speedy and covers 70% of the territory of the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
. It is growing by 100% annually and its sales topped 10 billion USD in 1995/6. 
\par Unfortunately, it is quite clear that ISDN is not THE answer. It is too slow, too user-unfriendly, has a bad interface wit
h other network types, it requires special hardware. There is no point in investing in temporary solutions when the right solution is staring the Internet in the face, though it is not implemented due to political circumstances. 
\par A cable modem is 80 times 
speedier than the ISDN and 700 times faster than a 14,400 bps modem. However, it does have problems in accommodating a two-way data transfer. There is also need to connect the fibre optic infrastructure which characterizes cable companies to the old coppe
r
 coaxial infrastructure which characterizes telephony. Cable users engage specially customized LANs (Ethernet) and the hardware is expensive (though equipment prices are forecast to collapse as demand increases). Cable companies simply did not invest in d
e
veloping the technology. The law (prior to the 1996 Communications Act) forbade them to do anything that was not one way transfer of video via cables. Now, with the more liberal regulative environment, it is a mere question of time until the technology is
 found. 
\par Actually, most consumers single out bad customer relations as their biggest problem with the cable companies - rather than technology. 
\par Experiments conducted with cable modems led to a doubling of usage time (from an average of 24 to 47 hours per m
onth per user) which was wholly attributable to the increased speed. This comes close to a cultural revolution in the allocation of leisure time. Numerically speaking: 7 million households in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} are fitted with a two-way data transfer cable modems. This is a small number and it is anyone's guess if it constitutes a critical mass. Sales of such modems amount to 1.3 billion USD annually. 
\par 50% of all cable subscribers also have a PC at home. To me it seems that the merging of the two technologies is inevitable. 
\par Other technological solutions - such as DSL, ADSL, and the more promising satellite broadband - are being developed and implemented, albeit slowly and inefficiently. Coverage is sporadic and frustrating waiting periods are measured in months.

\par Most Internet users (82%) work with the Windows operating system. About 11% own a Macintosh (much stronger graphically and more user-friendly). Only 7% continue to work on UNIX based systems (which, historically, fathe
red the Internet) - and this number is fast declining. A strong entrant is the free source LINUX operating system. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid4785983\charrsid16322966

\par Virtually all users surf through a browsing software. A fast dwindling minority (26%) use Netscape's products (mainly Navigator and Commun
icator) and the majority use Microsoft's Explorer (more than 60% of the market). Browsers are now free products and can be downloaded from the Internet. As late as 1997, it was predicted by major Internet consultancy firms that browser sales will top $4 b
illion by the year 2000. Such misguided predictions ignored the basic ethos of the Internet: free products, free content, free access.
\par Browsers are in for a great transformation. Most of them are likely to have 3-D, advanced audio, telephony / voice / video
 mail (v-mail), instant messaging, e-mail, and video conferencing capabilities integrated into the same browsing session. They will become self-customizing, intelligent, Internet interfaces. They will memorize the history of usage and user preferences and
 adapt themselves accordingly. They will allow content-specificity: unidentifiable smart agents will scour the Internet, make recommendations, compare prices, order goods and services and customize contents in line with self-adjusting user profiles. 

\par Two important technological developments must be considered: 
\par PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) - the ultimate personal (and office) communicators, easy to carry, they provide Internet (access) Everywhere, independent of suppliers and providers and of physical 
infrastructure (in an aeroplane, in the field, in a cinema). 
\par The second trend: wireless data transfer and wireless e-mail, whether through pagers, cellular phones, or through more sophisticated apparatus and hybrids such as smart phones. Geotech\rquote s product
s are an excellent example: e-mail, faxes, telephone calls and a connection to the Internet and to other, public and corporate, or proprietary, databases - all provided by the same gadget. This is the embodiment of the electronic, physically detached, off
ice. Wearable computing should be considered a part of this "ubiquitous or pervasive computing" wave.

\par "Parasitic" intermediaries occupy each stage in the Internet's food chain. 
\par Access to the Internet is still provided by "dumb pipes" - the Internet Service Providers (ISP) 
\par Content is still the preserve of content suppliers and so on. 
\par Some of these intermediaries are doomed to gradually fade or to suffer a substantial diminishing of their share of the market. Even "walled gardens" of content (such as AOL) are at risk.
\par By way of comparison, even today, ISPs have four times as many subscribers (worldwide) as AOL. Admittedly, this adversely affects the quality of the Internet - the i
nfrastructure maintained by the phone companies is slow and often succumbs to bottlenecks. The unequivocal intention of the telephony giants to become major players in the Internet market should also be taken into account. The phone companies will, thus, 
p
lay a dual role: they will provide access to their infrastructure to their competitors (sometimes, within a real or actual monopoly) - and they will compete with their clients. The same can be said about the cable companies. Controlling the last mile to t
h
e user's abode is the next big business of the Internet. Companies such as AOL are disadvantaged by these trends. It is imperative for AOL to obtain equal access to the cable company's backbone and infrastructure if it wants to survive. Hence its merger w
ith Time Warner. 
\par No wonder that many of the ISPs judge this intrusion on their turf by the phone and cable companies to constitute unfair competition. Yet, one should not forget that the barriers to entry are very low in the ISP market. It takes a minimal 
investment to become an ISP. 200 modems (which cost 200 USD each) are enough to satisfy the needs of 2000 average users who generate an income of 500,000 USD per annum to the ISP. Routers are equally as cheap nowadays. This is a nice return on the ISP

\par The Web houses the equivalent of 100 billion pages. Search Engine applications are used to locate specific information in this impressive, constantly proliferating library. They will be replaced, in the near future, by
 "Knowledge Structures" - gigantic encyclopaedias, whose text will contain references (hyperlinks) to other, relevant, sites. The far future will witness the emergence of the "Intelligent Archives" and the "Personal Newspapers" (read further for detailed 
e
xplanations). Some software applications will summarize content, others will index and automatically reference and hyperlink texts (virtual bibliographies). An average user will have an on-going interest in 500 sites. Special software will be needed to ma
n
age address books ("bookmarks", "favourites") and contents ("Intelligent Addressbooks"). The phenomenon of search engines dedicated to search a number of search engines simultaneously will grow ("Hyper- or meta- engines"). Meta-engines will work in the ba
c
kground and download hyperlinks and advertising (the latter is essential to secure the financial interest of site developers and owners). Statistical software which tracks ("how long was what done"), monitors ("what did they do while in the site") and cou
nts ("how many") visitors to sites already exists. Some of these applications have back-office facilities (accounting, follow-up, collections, even tele-marketing). They all provide time trails and some allow for auditing. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par This is but a small fragment of
 the rapidly developing net-scape: people and enterprises who make a living off the Internet craze rather than off the Internet itself. Everyone knows that there is more money in lecturing about how to make money on the Internet - than in the Internet its
e
lf. This maxim still holds true despite the 32 billion US dollars in E-commerce in 1998. Business to Consumer (B2C) sales grow less vigorously than Business to Business (B2B) sales and are likely to suffer another blow with the advent of Peer to Peer (P2P
) computer networks. The latter allow PCs to act as servers and thus enable the swapping of computer files asmong connected users (with or without a central directory).

\par This is the underprivileged sector of the Internet. They all lose mo
ney (even e-tailers which offer basic, standardized goods - books, CDs - with the exception, until September 11, of sites connected to tourism). No one thanks them for content produced with the investment of a lot of effort and a lot of money. A really qu
a
litative, fully commerce enabled site costs up to 5,000,000 USD, excluding site maintenance and customer and visitor services. Content providers are constantly criticized for lack of creativity or for too much creativity. More and more is asked of them. T
hey are exploited by intermediaries, hitchhikers and other parasites. This is all an off-shoot of the ethos of the Internet as a free content area. 
\par More than 100 million men and women constantly access the Web - but this number stands to grow (the median p
rediction: 300 million). Yet, while the Web is used by 35% of those with access to the Internet - e-mail is used by more than 60%. E-mail is by far the most common function ("killer app") and specialized applications (Eudora, Internet Mail, Microsoft Exch
ange) - free or ad sponsored - keep it accessible to all and user-friendly. 
\par Most of the users like to surf (browse, visit sites) the net without reason or goal in mind. This makes it difficult to apply traditional marketing techniques. 
\par What is the meaning of "targeted audiences" or "market shares" in this context? 
\par If a surfer visits sites which deal with aberrant sex and nuclear physics in the same session - what to make of it? 
\par The public and legislative backlash against the gathering of surfers' data by Internet ad agencies and other web sites - has led to growing ignorance regarding the profile of Internet users, their demography, habits, preferences and dislikes. 
\par People like the very act of surfing. They want to be entertained, then they use the Internet as a working tool, mostly in the service of their employer, who, usually foots the bill. Users love free downloads (mainly software). 
\par "Free" is a key word on the Internet: it used to belong to the US Government and to a bunch of universities. Users li
ke information, with emphasis on news and data about new products. But they do not like to shop on the net - yet. Only 38% of all surfers made a purchase during 1998. 
\par 67% of them adore virtual sex. 50% of the sites most often visited are porn sites (this 
is reminiscent of the early days of the Video Cassette Recorder - VCR). People dedicate the same amount of time to watching video cassettes or television as they do to surfing the net. The Internet seems to cannibalize television. 
\par Sex is followed by music
, sports, health, television, computers, cinema, politics, pets and cooking sites. People are drawn to interactive games. The Internet will shortly enable people to gamble, if not hampered by legislation. 10 billion USD in gambling money are predicted to 
pass through the net. This makes sense: nothing like a computer to provide immediate (monetary and psychological) rewards. 
\par Commerce on the net is another favourite. The Internet is a perfect medium for the sale of software and other digital products (e-books). The problem of data security is on its way to being solved with the SET (or other) world standard. 
\par As early as 1995, the Internet had more than 100 virtual shopping malls visited by 2.5 million shoppers (and probably double this number in 1996). 
\par The predictions for 1999 were between 1-5 billion USD of net shopping (plus 2 billion USD through on-line information providers, such as CompuServe and AOL) - proved woefully inaccurate. The actual number in 1998 was 7 times the prediction for 1999. 

\par It is also widely believed that circa 20% of the family budget will pass through the Internet as e-money and this amounts to 150 billion USD. 
\par The Internet will become a giant inter-bank clearing system and varied ATM type banking and investment services will be provided through it. Basically, everything can be done through the Internet: looking for a job, for instance. 
\par Yet, the Internet will never replace human interaction. People are likely to prefer personal banking, window shopping and the social experience of the shopping mall to Internet banking and e-commerce, or m-commerce. 
\par Some sites already sport classified ads. This is not a bad way to defray expenses, though most classified ads are free (it is the advertising they attract that matters). 
\par Another developing trend is website-rating and critique. It will be treated the way today\rquote s printed editions are. It will have a limited influence on the consumption decisions of some users. Browsers already sport buttons labelled "What\rquote 
s New" and "What's 
Hot". Most Search Engines recommend specific sites. Users are cautious. Studies discovered that no user, no matter how heavy, has consistently re-visited more than 200 sites, a minuscule number. The 10 most popular web sites (Yahoo!, MSN, etc.) attracted 
more than 50% of all Internet traffic. Site recommendation services often produce random - at times, wrong - selections for their user. There are also concerns regarding privacy issues. The backlah against Amazon's "readers' circles" is an example. }{

\par Again, there are two schools: 
\par One says that sites will be financed through advertising - and so will search engines and other applications accessed by users. 
\par Certain ASPs (Application Service Providers which rent out access to application software which resides on their servers) are considering this model. 
\par The second version is simpler and allows for the existence of non-commercial content. 
\par It proposes to collect negligible sums (cents or fractions of cents) from every user for every visit ("micro-payments") or a subscription fee. These accumulated cents or subscription fees will enable the owners of old sites t
o update and to maintain them and encourage entrepreneurs to develop new ones. Certain content aggregators (especially of digital textbooks) have adopted this model (Questia, Fathom). 
\par The adherents of the first school pointed at the 5 million USD invested in advertising during 1995 and to the 60 million or so invested during 1996. 
\par Its opponents point exactly at the same numbers: ridiculously small when contrasted with more conventional advertising modes. The potential of advertising on the net is limited 
to 1.5 billion USD annually in 1998, thundered the pessimists (many thought that even half that would be very nice). The actual figure was double the prediction but still woefully small and inadequate to support the Internet's content development. 
\par Compare these figures to the sale of Internet software ($4 billion), Internet hardware ($3 billion), Internet access provision ($4.2 billion) in 1995. 
\par Hembrecht and Quist estimated that Internet related industries scooped up 23.2 billion USD annually (A report released in mid-1996). 
\par And what follows advertising is hardly more enocuraging.
\par The consumer interacts and the product is delivered to him. This - the delivery phase - is a slow and enervating epilogue to the exciting affair of ordering through the net at 
the speed of light. Too many consumers still complain that they do not receive what they ordered, or that delivery is late and products defective. 
\par The solution may lie in the integration of advertising and content. Pointcast, for instance, integrated advertising into its news broadcasts, continuously streamed to the user\rquote 
s screen, even when inactive (they provided a downloadable active screen saver and ticker in a "push technology"). Downloading of digital music, video and text (e-books) will lead to immed
iate gratification of the consumer and will increase the efficacy of advertising. 
\par Whatever the case may be, a uniform, agreed upon system of rating as a basis for charging advertisers, is sorely needed. There is also the question of what does the advertiser pay for? 
\par Many advertisers (Procter and Gamble, for instance) refuse to pay according to the number of hits or impressions (=entries, visits to a site). They agree to pay only according to the number of the times that their advertisement was hit (page views).

\par This different basis for calculation is likely to upset all revenue scenarios. 
\par Very few sites of important, respectable newspapers are on a subscription basis. Dow Jones (Wall Street Journal) and The Economist, to mention but two.

\par The Internet is an assortment of billions of pages containing information. Some of them are visible and others are generated from hidden databases by users' requests ("Invisible Internet"). 
\par The Internet displays no discernible order, classificatio
n, or categorization. As opposed to "classical" libraries, no one has invented a cataloguing standard (remember Dewey?). This is so needed that it is amazing that it has not been invented yet. Some sites indeed apply the Dewey Decimal Syatem (Suite101). O
thers default to a directory structure (Open Directory, Yahoo!, Look Smart and others). 
\par Had such a standard existed (an agreed upon numerical cataloguing method) - each site would have self-classified. Sites would have an interest to do so to increase thei
r penetration rates and their visibility. This, naturally, would have eliminated the need for today's clunky, incomplete and (highly) inefficient search engines. 
\par A site whose number starts with 900 will be immediately identified as dealing with history an
d multiple classification will be encouraged to allow finer cross-sections to emerge. An example of such an emerging technology of "self classification" and "self-publication" (though limited to scholarly resources) is the "Academic Resource Channel" by S
cindex. 
\par Users will not be required to remember reams of numbers. Future browsers will be akin to catalogues, very much like the applications used in modern day libraries. Compare this utopia to the current dystopy. Users struggle with reams of irrelevant m
aterial to finally reach a partial and disappointing destination. At the same time, there likely are web sites which exactly match the poor user's needs. Yet, what currently determines the chances of a happy encounter between user and content - are the wh
ims of the specific search engine used and things like meta-tags, headlines, a fee paid, or the right opening sentences. 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 2. Screen versus Page}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 
\par The computer screen, because of physical limitations (size, the fact that it has to be scrolled) fails to effecti
vely compete with the printed page. The latter is still the most ingenious medium yet invented for the storage and release of textual information. Granted: a computer screen is better at highlighting discrete units of information. So, this draws the batll
e lines: structures (printed pages) versus units (screen), the continuous and easily reversible versus the discrete. 
\par The solution is an efficient way to translate computer screens to printed matter. It is hard to believe, but no such thing exists. Computer
 screens are still hostile to off-line printing. In other words: if a user copies information from the Internet to his Word Processor (or vice versa, for that matter) - he ends up with a fragmented, garbage-filled and non-aesthetic document. 
\par Very few site developers try to do something about it - even fewer succeed. 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 3. The Internet and the CD-ROM}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 
\par One of the biggest mistakes of content suppliers is that they do not mix contents or have a "static-dynamic interaction". 
\par The Internet can now easily interact with other media (especially with audio CDs and with CD-ROMs) - even as the user surfs. 
\par Examples abound: 
\par A shopping catalogue can be distributed on a CD-ROM by mail. The Internet Site will allow the user to order a product previously selected from the cat
alogue, while off-line. The catalogue could also be updated through the site (as is done with CD-ROM encyclopedias). 
\par The advantages of the CD-ROM are clear: very fast access time (dozens of times faster than the access to a site using a dial up connection) and a data storage capacity tens of times bigger than the average website. 
\par Another example: a CD-ROM can be distributed, containing hundreds of advertisements. The consumer will select the ad that he wants to see and will connect to the Internet to view a relevant video. 
\par He could then also have an interactive chat (or a conference) with a salesperson, receive information about the company, about the ad, about the advertising agency which created the ad - and so on. 
\par CD-ROM based encyclopedias (such as the Britannica, Encarta, Grolier) already contain hyperlinks which carry the user to sites selected by an Editorial Board. 
\par But CD-ROMs are probably a doomed medium. This industry chose to emphasize the wrong things. Storage capacity increased exponentially
 and, within a year, desktops with 80 Gb hard disks will be common. Moreover, the Network Computer - the stripped down version of the personal computer - will put at the disposal of the average user terabytes in storage capacity and the processing power o
f
 a supercomputer. What separates computer users from this utopia is the communication bandwidth. With the introduction of radio, statellite, ADSL broadband services, cable modems and compression methods - video (on demand), audio and data will be availabl
e speedily and plentifully. 
\par The CD-ROM, on the other hand, is not mobile. It requires installation and the utilization of sophisticated hardware and software. This is no user friendly push technology. It is nerd-oriented. As a result, CD-ROMs are not an im
mediate medium. There is a long time lapse between the moment they are purchased and the moment the first data become accessible to the user. Compare this to a book or a magazine. Data in these oldest of media is instantly available to the user and allows
 for easy and accurate "back" and "forward" functions. 
\par Perhaps the biggest mistake of CD-ROM manufacturers has been their inability to offer an integrated hardware and software package. CD-ROMs are not compact. A Walkman is a compact hardware-cum-software 
package. It is easily transportable, it is thin, it contains numerous, user-friendly, sophisticated functions, it provides immediate access to data. So does the discman or the MP3-man. This cannot be said of the CD-ROM. By tying its future to the obsolete
 concept of stand-alone, expensive, inefficient and technologically unreliable personal computers - CD-ROMs have sentenced themselves to oblivion (with the possible exception of reference material).

\par These already exist. A visit to the on-line Encyclopaedia Britannica exemplifies some of the tremendous, mind boggling possibilities: 
\par Each entry is hyperlinked to sites on the Internet which deal with the same subject matter. The sites are carefully screened (though more detailed 
descriptions of each site should be available - they could be prepared either by the staff of the encyclopaedia or by the site owner). Links are available to data in various forms, including audio and video. Everything can be copied to the hard disk or to
 CD-ROMs. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid4785983\charrsid16322966

\par This is a new conception of a knowledge centre - not just an assortment of material. It is modular, can be added on and subtracted from. It can be linked to a voice Q&A centre. Queries by subscribers can be answered by e-mail, by fax, posted on
 the site, hard copies can be sent by post. This "Trivial Pursuit" service could be very popular - there is considerable appetite for "Just in Time Information". The Library of Congress - together with a few other libraries - is in the process of making j
ust such a service available to the public (CDRS - Collaborative Digital Reference Service).

\par Hard to believe, but very few sites encourage their guests to express an opinion about the site, its contents and its aesthetics. This indic
ates an ossified mode of thinking about the most dynamic mass medium ever created, the only interactive mass medium yet. Each site must absolutely contain feedback and rating questionnaires. It has the side benefit of creating a database of the visitors t
o the site. 
\par Moreover, each site can easily become a "knowledge centre". 
\par Let us consider a site dedicated to advertising and marketing: 
\par It can contain feedback questionnaires (what do you think about the site, suggestions for improvement, mailto and leave message facilities, etc.) 
\par It can contain rating questionnaires (rate these ads, these TV or radio shows, these advertising campaigns). 
\par It can allocate
 some space to clients to create their home pages in (these home pages could lead to their sites, to other sites, to other sections of the host site - and, in any case, will serve as a display of the creative talent of the site owners). This will give the
 site owners a picture of the distribution of the areas of interest of the visitors to the site. 
\par The site can include statistical, tracking and counter software. 
\par Such a site can refer to hundreds of useful shareware applications (which deal with different
 aspects of advertising and marketing, for instance). Developers of applications will be able to use the site to promote their products. Other practical applications could also be referred to from - or reside on - the site (browsers, games, search engines
). 
\par And all this can be organized in a portal structure (for instance, by adopting the open software of the Open Directory Project).

\par The Internet is the world's largest "publisher", by far. It "publishes" FAQs (Frequent
 Answers and Questions regarding almost every technical matter in the world), e-zines (electronic versions of magazines, not a very profitable pursuit), the electronic versions of dailies (together with on-line news and information services), reference an
d other e-books, monographs, articles and minutes of discussions ("threads"), among other types of material. 
\par Publishing an e-zine has a few advantages: it promotes the sales of the printed edition, it helps to sign on subscribers and it leads to the sale o
f advertising space. The electronic archive function (see next section) saves the need to file back issues, the space required to do so and the irritating search for data items. 
\par The future trend is a combined subscription: electronic (mainly for the archival value and the ability to hyperlink to additional information) and printed (easier to browse current issue). 
\par The electronic daily presents other advantages: 
\par It allows for immediate feedback and for flowing, almost real-time, communication between writ
ers and readers. The electronic version, therefore, acquires a gyroscopic function: a navigation instrument, always indicating deviations from the "right" course. The content can be instantly updated and immediacy has its premium (remember the Lewinsky af
fair?). 
\par Strangely, this (conventional) field was the first to develop a "virtual reality" facet. There are virtual "magazine stalls". They look exactly like the real thing and the user can buy a paper using his mouse. 
\par Specialty hand held devices already a
llow for downloading and storage of vast quantities of data (up to 4000 print pages). The user gains access to libraries containing hundreds of texts, adapted to be downloaded, stored and read by the specific device. Again, a convergence of standards is t
o be expected in this field as well (the final contenders will probably be Adobe's PDF against Microsoft's MS-Reader). }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid4785983\charrsid16322966

Drawing a comparison from the development of a human baby - the human race has just commenced to develop its neural system. 
\par The Internet fulfils all the functions of the Nervous System in the body and is, both functionally and structurally,
 pretty similar. It is decentralized, redundant (each part can serve as functional backup in case of malfunction). It hosts information which is accessible in a few ways, it contains a memory function, it is multimodal (multimedia - textual, visual, audio
 and animation).

\par To carry the metaphor of "a collective brain" further, we would expect the processing of information to take place in the Internet, rather than inside the end-user\rquote 
s hardware (the same way that information is processed in the brain, not in the eyes). Desktops will receive the results and comm
unicate with the Net to receive additional clarifications and instructions and to convey information gathered from their environment (mostly, from the user). 
\par This is part fo the philosophy of the JAVA programming language. It deals with applets - small bits of software - and links different computer platforms by means of software. 
\par Put differently: 
\par Future servers will contain not only information (as they do today) - bu
t also software applications. The user of an application will not be forced to buy it. He will not be driven into hardware-related expenditures to accommodate the ever growing size of applications. He will not find himself wasting his scarce memory and co
m
puting resources on passive storage. Instead, he will use a browser to call a central computer. This computer will contain the needed software, broken to its elements (=applets, small applications). Anytime the user wishes to use one of the functions of t
h
e application, he will siphon it off the central computer. When finished - he will "return" it. Processing speeds and response times will be such that the user will not feel at all that it is not with his own software that he is working (the question of o
w
nership will be very blurred in such a world). This technology is available and it provoked a heated debated about the future shape of the computing industry as a whole (desktops - really power packs - or network computers, a little more than dumb termina

\par LANs (Local Area Networks) are no longer a rarity in corporate offices. WANs (wide Area Networks) are used to connect geographically dispersed organs of the same legal entity (branches of a bank, daughter companies, a sales force). Many LANs
 are wireless. 
\par The intranet / extranet and wireless LANs will be the winners. They will gradually eliminate both fixed line LANs and WANs. The Internet offers equal, platform-independent, location-independent and time of day - independent access to all th
e members of an organization.Sophisticated firewall security application protects the privacy and confidentiality of the intranet from all but the most determined and savvy hackers. 
\par The Intranet is an inter-organizational communication network, constructed on the platform of the Internet and which enjoys all its advantages. The extranet is open to clients and suppliers as well. 
\par The company's server can be accessed by anyone authorized, from anywhere, at any time (with local - rather than international - c
ommunication costs). The user can leave messages (internal e-mail or v-mail), access information - proprietary or public - from it and to participate in "virtual teamwork" (see next chapter). 
\par By the year 2002, a standard intranet interface will emerge. Th
is will be facilitated by the opening up of the TCP/IP communication architecture and its availability to PCs. A billion USD will go just to finance intranet servers - or, at least, this is the median forecast. 
\par The development of measures to safeguard ser
ver routed inter-organizational communication (firewalls) is the solution to one of two obstacles to the institution of the Intranet. The second problem is the limited bandwidth which does not permit the efficient transfer of audio (not to mention video).
 
\par It is difficult to conduct video conferencing through the Internet. Even the voices of discussants who use internet phones come out (slightly) distorted. 
\par All this did not prevent 95% of the Fortune 1000 from installing intranet. 82% of the rest intend to install one by the end of this year. Medium to big size American firms have 50-100 intranet terminals per every internet one. 
\par At the end of 1997, there were 10 web servers per every other type of server in organizations. The sale of intranet related software was projected to multiply by 16 (to 8 billion USD) by the year 1999. 
\par One of the greatest advantages of the intranet is the ability to transfer documents between the various parts of an organization. Consider Visa: it pushed 2 million documents per day internally in 1996. 
\par An organization equipped with an intranet can (while protected by firewalls) give its clients or suppliers access to non-classified correspondence. This notion has its\~ charm. Consider a newspaper: it can give access to all the mater
ials which were discarded by the editors. Some news are fit to print - yet are discarded because of\~
 space limitations. Still, someone is bound to be interested. It costs the newspaper close to nothing (the material is, normally, already computer-resident)
 - and it might even generate added circulation and income. It can be even conceived as an "underground, non-commercial, alternative" newspaper for a wholly different readership. 
\par The above is but one example of the possible use of the intranet to communicate with the organization\rquote s consumer base. 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 3. Mail and Chat}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 
\par The Internet (its e-mail possibilities) is eroding traditional mail. The market share of the post office in conveying messages by regular mail has dwindled from 77% to 62% (1995). E-mail has expanded to capture 36% (up from 19%). 
\par 90% of customers with on-line access use e-mail from time to time and 60% work with it regularly. More than 2 billion messages traverse the internet daily. 
\par E-mail applications are available as freeware and are included 
in all browsers. Thus, the Internet has completely assimilated what used to be a separate service, to the extent that many people make the mistake of thinking that e-mail is a feature of the Internet. Microsoft continues to incorporate previously independ
ent applications in its browsers - a behaviour which led to the 1999 anti-trust lawsuit against it. 
\par The internet will do to phone calls what it has done to mail. Already there are applications (Intel\rquote s, Vocaltec\rquote s, Net2Phone) which enable the user to condu
ct a phone conversation through his computer. The voice quality has improved. The discussants can cut into each others words, argue and listen to tonal nuances. Today, the parties (two or more) engaging in the conversation must possess the same software a
n
d the same (computer) hardware. In the very near future, computer-to-regular phone applications will eliminate this requirement. And, again, simultaneous multi-modality: the user can talk over the phone, see his party, send e-mail, receive messages and tr
ansfer documents - without obstructing the flow of the conversation. 
\par The cost of transferring voice will become so negligible that free voice traffic is conceivable in 3-5 years. Data traffic will overtake voice traffic by a wide margin. 
\par This beats regular phones. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid4785983\charrsid16322966 
\par \page }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 
\par The next phase will probably involve virtual reality. Each of the parties will be represented by an "avatar", a 3-D figurine generated by the application (or the user's likeness mapped into the software and superimposed on the the avatar). The
se figurines will be multi-dimensional: they will possess their own communication patterns, special habits, history, preferences - in short: their own "personality". 
\par Thus, they will be able to maintain an "identity" and a consistent pattern of communication which they will develop over time. 
\par Such a figure could host a site, accept, welcome and guide visitors, all the time bearing their preferences in its electronic "mind". It could narrate the news, like "Ananova" does. Visiting sites in the future is bound to be a much more pleasant affair.

\par In 1996, the four corporate giants (Visa, MasterCard, Netscape and Microsoft) agreed on a standard for effecting secure payments through the Internet: SET. Internet commerce is supposed to mushroom by a fact
or of 50 to 25 billion USD. Site owners will be able to collect rent from passing visitors - or fees for services provided within the site. Amazon instituted an honour system to collect donations from visitors. Dedicated visitors will not be deterred by s
uch trifles.

\par The Internet allows simultaneous communication between an almost unlimited number of users. This is coupled with the efficient transfer of multimedia (video included) files. 
\par This opens up a vista of mind boggling opportunities which are the real core of the Internet revolution: the virtual collaborative ("Follow the Sun") modes. 
\par Examples: 
\par A group of musicians will be able to compose music or play it - while spatially and temporally separated; 
\par Advertising agencies will be able to co-produce ad campaigns in a real time interactive mode; 
\par Cinema and TV films will be produced from disparate geographical spots through the teamwork of people who never meet, except through the net. 
\par These examples illustrate the concept 
of the "virtual community". Locations in space and time will no longer hinder a collaboration in a team: be it scientific, artistic, cultural, or for the provision of services (a virtual law firm or accounting office, a virtual consultancy network). 

\par Two on going developments are the virtual mall and the virtual catalogue. 
\par There are well over 300 active virtual malls in the Internet. They were frequented by 32.5 million shoppers, who shopped in them for goods and services in 1998. The intranet can also be thought of as a "virtual organization", or a "virtual business". 

\par The virtual mall is a computer "space" (pages) in the internet, wherein "shops" are located. These shops offer their wares using visual, audio and textual means. The visitor passes a gate in
to the store and looks through its offering, until he reaches a buying decision. Then he engages in a feedback process: he pays (with a credit card), buys the product and waits for it to arrive by mail. The manufacturers of digital products (intellectual 
property such as e-books or software) have begun selling their merchandise on-line, as file downloads. 
\par Yet, slow communications and limited bandwidth - constrain the growth potential of this mode of sale. Once solved - intellectual property will be sold di
rectly from the net, on-line. Until such time, the intervention of the Post Office is still required. So, then virtual mall is nothing but a glorified computerized mail catalogue or Buying Channel, the only difference being the exceptionally varied invent
ory. 
\par Websites which started as "specialty stores" are fast transforming themselves into multi-purpose virtual malls. Amazon.com, for instance, has bought into a virtual pharmacy and into other virtual businesses. It is now selling music, video, electronics
 and many other products. It started as a bookstore. 
\par This contrasts with a much more creative idea: the virtual catalogue. It is a form of narrowcasting (as opposed to broadcasting): a surgically accurate targeting of potential consumer audiences. Each gr
oup of profiled consumers (no matter how small) is fitted with their own - digitally generated - catalogue. This is updated daily: the variety of wares on offer (adjusted to reflect inventory levels, consumer preferences and goods in transit) - and prices
 (sales, discounts, package deals) change in real time. 
\par The user will enter the site and there delineate his consumption profile and his preferences. A customized catalogue will be immediately generated for him. 
\par From then on, the history of his purchases, preferences and responses to feedback questionnaires will be accumulated and added to a database. 
\par Each catalogue generated for him will come replete with order forms. Once the user concluded his purchases, his profile will be updated. 
\par There is no techno
logical obstacles to implementing this vision today - only administrative and legal ones. Big retail stores are not up to processing the flood of data expected to arrive. They also remain highly sceptical regarding the feasibility of the new medium. And p
rivacy issues prevent data mining or the effective collection and usage of personal data. 
\par The virtual catalogue is a private case of a new internet off-shoot: the "smart (shopping) agents". These are AI applications with "long memories". 
\par They draw detailed profiles of consumers and users and then suggest purchases and refer to the appropriate sites, catalogues, or virtual malls. 
\par They also provide price comparisons and the new generation (NetBot) cannot be blocked or fooled by using differing product categories. 
\par In the future, these agents will refer also to real life retail chains and issue a map of the branch or store closest to an address specified by the user (the default being his residence). This technology can be seen in action in a few music sites 
on the web and is likely to be dominant with wireless internet appliances. The owner of an internet enabled (third generation) mobile phone is likely to be the target of geographically-specific marketing campaigns, ads and special offers pertaining to his
 current location (as reported by his GPS - satellite Geographic Positioning System).

\par Internet news are advantaged. They can be frequently and dynamically updated (unlike static print news) and be always accessible (similar to print news), immediate and fresh. 
\par The future will witness a form of interactive news. A special "corner" in the site will be open to updates posted by the public (the equivalent of press releases). This will provide readers with a glimpse into the making of the news,
 the raw material news are made of. The same technology will be applied to interactive TVs. Content will be downloaded from the internet and be displayed as an overlay on the TV screen or in a square in a special location. The contents downloaded will be 
directly connected to the TV programming. Thus, the biography and track record of a football player will be displayed during a football match and the history of a country when it gets news cove}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid12081915\charrsid16322966 r}{

 easily purchased or created. The investment is low and getting lower with the introduction of competition in the field of domain registration services and the increase in the number of top domains. 
\par Then, infrastructure can be erected - for a shopping mall, for free home pages, for a portal, or for another purpose. It is precisely this infrastructure that the developer can later sell, lease, franchise, or rent out. 
\par At the beginning, only members of the fringes and the avant-garde (inventors, risk assuming entrepreneurs, gamblers) invest in a new invention. The invention of a new communications technology is mostly accompanied by devastating silence. 
\par No one knows to say what are the optimal uses of the invention (in other words, what is its future). Many -
 mostly members of the scientific and business elites - argue that there is no real need for the invention and that it substitutes a new and untried way for old and tried modes of doing the same thing (so why assume the risk?) 
\par These criticisms are usually founded: 
\par To start with, there is, indeed, no need for the new medium. A new medium invents itself - and the need for it. It also generates its own market to satisfy this newly found need. 
\par Two prime examples are the personal computer and the compact disc. 
\par When the PC was invented, its uses were completely unclear. Its performance was lacking, its abilities limited, it was horribly user unfriendly. 
\par It suffered from faulty design, absent user comfort and ease of use and required considerable professional knowledge to operate. The worst part was that this knowledge was unique to the new invention (not portable). 
\par It reduced labour mobility and limited one's professional horizons. There were many gripes among those assigned to tame the new beast. 
\par The PC was
 thought of, at the beginning, as a sophisticated gaming machine, an electronic baby-sitter. As the presence of a keyboard was detected and as the professional horizon cleared it was thought of in terms of a glorified typewriter or spreadsheet. It was use
d
 mainly as a word processor (and its existence justified solely on these grounds). The spreadsheet was the first real application and it demonstrated the advantages inherent to this new machine (mainly flexibility and speed). Still, it was more (speed) of
 the same. A quicker ruler or pen and paper. What was the difference between this and a hand held calculator (some of them already had computing, memory and programming features)? 
\par The PC was recognized as a medium only 30 years after it was invented with t
he introduction of multimedia software. All this time, the computer continued to spin off markets and secondary markets, needs and professional specialities. The talk as always was centred on how to improve on }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\ul\insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 existing }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 markets and solutions. 
\par The Internet is the computer\rquote s first important breakthrough. Hitherto the computer was only quantitatively different - the multimedia and the Internet have made it qualitatively superior, actually, sui generis, unique. 
\par This, precisely, is the ghost haunting the Internet: 
\par It has been invented, is maintained and is operated by computer professionals. For decades these people have been conditioned to think in Olympic terms: more, stronger, higher. Not: new, unprecedented, non-existent. To improve - not to invent. They st
umbled across the Internet - it invented itself despite its own creators. 
\par Computer professionals (hardware and software experts alike) - are linear thinkers. The Internet is non linear and modular. 
\par It is still the age of hackers. There is still a lot to 
be done in improving technological prowess and powers. But their control of the contents is waning and they are being gradually replaced by communicators, creative people, advertising executives, psychologists and the totally unpredictable masses who floc
k to flaunt their home pages. 
\par These all are attuned to the user, his mental needs and his information and entertainment preferences. 
\par The compact disc is a different tale. It was intentionally invented to improve upon an existing technology (basically, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Edison{\*\xmlclose}\rquote 
s Gramophone). Market-wise, this was a major gamble: the improvement was, at first, debatable (many said that the sound quality of the first generation of compact discs was inferior to that of its contemporaneous record players). Consumers had 
to be convinced to change both software and hardware and to dish out thousands of dollars just to listen to what the manufacturers claimed was better quality Bach. A better argument was the longer life of the software (though contrasted with the limited l
ife expectancy of the consumer, some of the first sales pitches sounded absolutely morbid). 
\par The computer suffered from unclear positioning. The compact disc was very clear as to its main functions - but had a rough time convincing the consumers. 
\par Every med
ium is first controlled by the technical people. Gutenberg was a printer - not a publisher. Yet, he is the world's most famous publisher. The technical cadre is joined by dubious or small-scale entrepreneurs and, together, they establish ventures with no 
c
lear vision, market-oriented thinking, or orderly plan of action. The legislator is also dumbfounded and does not grasp what is happening - thus, there is no legislation to regulate the use of the medium. Witness the initial confusion concerning copyright
ed software and the copyrights of ROM embedded software. Abuse or under-utilization of resources grow. Recall the sale of radio frequencies to the first cellular phone operators in the West - a situation which repeats itself in Eastern and 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Central Europe{\*\xmlclose} nowadays. 
\par But then more complex transactions - exactly as in real estate in "real life" - begin to emerge. 
\par This distinction is important. While in real life it is possible to sell an undeveloped plot of land - no one will buy "pages". The supply of these is unlimited - their scarcity (and, therefore, their virtual price) is zero. 
\par The second example involves the utilization of a site - rather than its mere availability. 
\par A developer could open a site wherein first time authors will be able to publish t
heir first manuscript - for a fee. Evidently, such a fee will be a fraction of what it would take to publish a "real life" book. The author could collect money for any downloading of his book - and split it with the site developer. The potential buyers wi
ll be provided with access to the contents and to a chapter of the books. This is currently being done by a few fledgling firms but a full scale publishing industry has not yet developed. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid12081915\charrsid16322966

\par At this stage, the medium and the resources attached to it are very cheap, accessible, under no regulatory constraints. The public sector steps in: higher education institutions, religious institutions, government, no
t for profit organizations, non governmental organizations (NGOs), trade unions, etc. Bedevilled by limited financial resources, they regard the new medium as a cost effective way of disseminating their messages. 
\par The Internet was not exempt from this phas
e which ended only a few years ago. It started with a complete computer anarchy manifested in ad hoc networks, local networks, networks of organizations (mainly universities and organs of the government such as DARPA, a part of the defence establishment, 
in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
). Non commercial entities jumped on the bandwagon and started sewing these networks together (an activity fully subsidized by government funds). The result was a globe encompassing network of academic institutions. The American
 Pentagon established the network of all networks, the ARPANET. Other government departments joined the fray, headed by the National Science Foundation (NSF) which withdrew only lately from the Internet. 
\par The Internet (with a different name) became semi-public property - with access granted to the chosen few. 
\par Radio took precisely this course. Radio transmissions started in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 in 1920. Those were anarchic broadcasts with no discernible regularity. Non commercial organizations and not
 for profit organizations began their own broadcasts and even created radio broadcasting infrastructure (albeit of the cheap and local kind) dedicated to their audiences. Trade unions, certain educational institutions and religious groups commenced "publi
c radio" broadcasts. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid4785983\charrsid16322966

\par When the users (e.g., listeners in the case of the radio, or owners of PCs and modems in the example of the Internet) reach a critical mass - the business sector is alerted. In the name of capitalist ideology (a
nother religion, really) it demands "privatization" of the medium. This harps on very sensitive strings in every Western soul: the efficient allocation of resources which is the result of competition, corruption and inefficiency naturally associated with 
the public sector ("Other People\rquote 
s Money" - OPM), the ulterior motives of members of the ruling political echelons (the infamous American Paranoia), a lack of variety and of catering to the tastes and interests of certain audiences, the equation private enterprise = democracy and more. 

\par The end result is the same: the private sector takes over the medium from "below" (makes offers to the owners or operators of the medium - that they cannot possibly refuse) - or from "above" (successful lobbying in the corrid
ors of power leads to the appropriate legislation and the medium is "privatized"). 
\par Every privatization - especially that of a medium - provokes public opposition. There are (usually founded) suspicions that the interests of the public were compromised and
 sacrificed on the altar of commercialization and rating. Fears of monopolization and cartelization of the medium are evoked - and justified, in due time. Otherwise, there is fear of the concentration of control of the medium in a few hands. All these thi
ngs do happen - but the pace is so slow that the initial fears are forgotten and public attention reverts to fresher issues. 
\par A new Communications Act was legislated in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} in 1934. It was meant to transform radio frequencies into a n
ational resource to be sold to the private sector which will use it to transmit radio signals to receivers. In other words: the radio was passed on to private and commercial hands. Public radio was doomed to be marginalized. 
\par The American administration withdrew from its last major involvement in the Internet in April 1995, when the NSF ceased to finance some of the networks and, thus, privatized its hitherto heavy involvement in the net. 
\par A new Communications Act was legislated in 1996. It permitted "organized anarchy". It allowed media operators to invade each other\rquote s territories. 
\par Phone companies will be allowed to transmit video and cable companies will be allowed to transmit telephony, for instance. This is all phased over a long period of time - still,
 it is a revolution whose magnitude is difficult to gauge and whose consequences defy imagination. It carries an equally momentous price tag - official censorship. "Voluntary censorship", to be sure, somewhat toothless standardization and enforcement auth
o
rities, to be sure - still, a censorship with its own institutions to boot. The private sector reacted by threatening litigation - but, beneath the surface it is caving in to pressure and temptation, constructing its own censorship codes both in the cable

\par This phase is the next in the Internet's history, though, it seems, unbeknownst to it. 
\par It is characterized by enhanced activities of legislation. Legislators, on all levels, discover the medium and lurch at it passionately. Resources which were considered "free", suddenly are transformed to "national treasures not to be dispensed with cheap
ly, casually and with frivolity". 
\par It is conceivable that certain parts of the Internet will be "nationalized" (for instance, in the form of a licensing requirement) and tendered to the private sector. Legislation will be enacted which will deal with permit
ted and disallowed content (obscenity? incitement? racial or gender bias?) 
\par No medium in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 (not to mention the wide world) has eschewed such legislation. There are sure to be demands to allocate time (or space, or software, or cont
ent, or hardware) to "minorities", to "public affairs", to "community business". This is a tax that the business sector will have to pay to fend off the eager legislator and his nuisance value. 
\par All this is bound to lead to a monopolization of hosts and se
rvers. The important broadcast channels will diminish in number and be subjected to severe content restrictions. Sites which will not succumb to these requirements - will be deleted or neutralized. Content guidelines (euphemism for censorship) exist, even
 as we write, in all major content providers (CompuServe, AOL, Geocities, Tripod, Prodigy).

\par This happens in every medium but it doubly applies to a computer-dependent medium, such as the Internet. 
\par Computer technology seems to abide by "{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Moore{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}\rquote 
s Law" which says that the number of transistors which can be put on a chip doubles itself every 18 months. As 
a result of this miniaturization, computing power quadruples every 18 months and an exponential series ensues. Organic-biological-DNA computers, quantum computers, chaos computers - prompted by vast profits and spawned by inventive genius will ensure the 
longevity and continued applicability of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Moore{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}'s Law. 
\par The Internet is also subject to "Metcalf\rquote s Law". 
\par It says that when we connect N computers to a network - we get an increase of N to the second power in its computing / processing power. And these N computers are more powerful every year, according to {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Moore{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}\rquote s Law. 
\par The growth of computing powers in networks is a multiple of the effects of the two laws. More and more computers with ever increasing computing power get connected and create an exponential 16 times growth in the network\rquote 
s computing power every 18 months. 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 2. Free Availability of Software and Connection}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 
\par This is prevalent in the Net where even potentially commercial software can be downloaded for free. In many countries television viewers still pay for television broadcasts - but in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and many other countries in the West, the basic package of television channels comes free of charge. 
\par As users / consumers form a habit of using (or consuming) the software
 - it is commercialized and begins to carry a price tag. This is what happened with the advent of cable television: contents are sold for subscription and usage (Pay Per View - PPV) fees. 
\par Gradually, this is what will happen to most of the sites and softwa
re on the Net. Those which survive will begin to collect usage fees, access fees, subscription fees, downloading fees and other, appropriately named, fees. These fees are bound to be low - but it is the principle that counts. Even a few cents per transact
ion will accumulate to hefty sums with the traffic which will characterize the Net (or, at least its more popular locales). 
\par Adverising revenues will allow ISPs to offer free communication and storage volume. Gradually, connect time charges imposed by the p
hone companies will be eroded by tough competition from the likes of the cable companies. Accessing the internet might well be free of all charges in 10 years time.

\par As long as the computer is less user friendly and less reli
able (predictable) than television - less of a black box - its potential (and its future) is limited. Television attracts 3.5 billion users daily. The Internet will attract - under the most exuberant scenario - less than one tenth of this number of people
.
 The only reasons for this disparity are (the lack of) user friendliness and reliability. Even browsers, among the most user friendly applications ever - are not sufficiently so. The user still needs to know how to use a keyboard and must possess some bas
ic acquaintance with the operating system. 
\par The more mature the medium, the more friendly it becomes. Finally, it will be operated using speech or common language. There will be room left for user "hunches" and built in flexible responses. 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 4. Social Taxes}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 
\par Sooner or later, the business sector has to mollify the God of public opinion by offerings of political and social nature. The Internet is an affluent, educated, yuppie medium. It necessitates a control of the English language, live interest in informatio
n
 and its various uses (scientific, commercial, other), a lot of resources (free time, money to invest in hardware, software and connect time). It empowers - and thus deepens the divide between the haves and have-nots, the knowing and the ignorant, the com
puter illiterate. 
\par In sho
rt: the Internet is an elitist medium. Publicly, this is an unhealthy posture. "Internetophobia" is already discernible. People (and politicians) talk about how unsafe the Internet is and about its possible uses for racial, sexist and pornographic purpose
s. The wider public is in a state of awe. 
\par So, site builders and owners will do well to begin to improve their image: provide free access to schools and community centres, bankroll internet literacy classes, freely distribute contents and software to educat
ional institutions, collaborate with researchers and social scientists and engineers. 
\par In short: encourage the view that the Internet is a medium catering to the needs of the community and the underprivileged, a mostly altruist endeavour. This also happens
 to make good business sense by educating a future generation of users. He who visited a site when a student, free of charge - will pay to do so when made an executive. Such a user will also pass on the information within and without his organization. Thi
s is called media exposure. 
\par The future will, no doubt, witness public Internet terminals, subsidized ISP accounts, free Internet classes and an alternative "non-commercial, public" approach to the Net. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid12081915\charrsid16322966

\par The Internet has no central (or even decentralized) structure. In reality, it hardl
y has a structure at all. It is a collection of 16 million computers (end 1996) connected through thousands of networks. There are organizations which purport to set Internet standards (like the aforementioned ISOC, or the domain setting ICANN) - but they
 are all voluntary organizations, with no binding legal, enforcement, or adjudication powers. The result is often mayhem. 
\par Many erroneously call the Internet the first democratic medium. Yet, it hardly qualifies as a medium and by no stretch of terminology 
is it democratic. Democracy has institutions, hierarchies, order. The Internet has none of these things. There are some vague understandings as to what is and is not allowed. This is a "code of honour" (more reminiscent of the Sicilian Mob than of the Bri
tish Parliament, let\rquote s say). Violations are punished by excommunication (of the violating site or person). 
\par The Internet has culture - but no education. Freedom of Speech is entrenched. Members of this virtual community react adversely to ideas of censorshi
p, even when applied to hard core porno. In 1999, hackers hacked major government sites following an FBI initiative against hacking-related crimes. Government initiatives (in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}

\par The Internet is not dependent upon a given hardware or software. True, it is accessible only through computers and there are dominant browsers. 
\par But the Internet accommodates any digital (bit transfer) platform. Internet will 
be incorporated in the future into portable computers, palmtops, PDAs, mobile phones, cable television, telephones (with voice interface), home appliances and even wrist watches. It will be accessible to all, regardless of hardware and software. 
\par The situa
tion is, obviously, different with other media. There is standard hardware (the television set, the radio receiver, the digital print equipment). Data transfer modes are standardized as well. The only variable is the contents - and even this is standardiz
ed in an age of American cultural imperialism. Today, one can see the same television programs all over the globe, regardless of cultural or geographical differences. 
\par Here is a reasonable prognosis for the Internet: 
\par It will "broadcast" (it is, of course, 
a PULL medium, not a PUSH medium - see next chapter) to many kinds of hardware. Its functions will be controlled by 2-5 very common software applications. But it will differ from television in that contents will continue to be decentralized: every point o
n the Net is a potential producer of content at low cost. This is the equivalent of producing a talk show using a single home video camera. And the contents will remain varied. 
\par Naturally, marketing content (sites) will remain an expensive art. Sites will also be richer or poorer, in accordance with the investment made in them.

\par The Internet is the first medium in human history that is non-linear and totally modular. 
\par A television program is broadcast from a transmitter, through the airwaves to a receiver (=the television set). The viewer sits opposite this receiver and passively watches. This is an entirely linear process. The Internet is different: 
\par When communicating through the Internet, there is no way to predict 
how the information will reach its destination. The routing of information through the network is completely random, very much like the principle governing the telephony system (but on a global scale). The latter is not a point-to-point linear network. Ra
ther, it is a network of networks. Our voice is transmitted back and forth inside a gigantic maze of copper wires and optic fibres. It seeps through any available wire - until it reaches its destination. 
\par It is the same with the Internet. 
\par Information is divided to packets. An address is attached to each packet and - using the TCP/IP data transfer protocol - is dispatched to roam this worldwide labyrinth. But the path from one neighbourhood of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}London{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} to another may traverse {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Japan{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. 
\par The really ingenious thing about the Internet is that each computer (each receiver or end user) indeed burdens the system by imposing on it its information needs (as is the case with other media) - but it also assists in the task of pushing information p
ackets on to their destinations. It seems that this contribution to the system outweighs the burdens imposed upon it. 
\par The network has a growth potential which is always bigger than the number of its users. It is as though television sets assisted in passi
ng the signals received by them to other television sets. Every computer which is a member of the network is both a message (content) and a medium (active information channel), both a transmitter and a receiver. If 30% of all computers on the Net were to 
crash - there will be no operational impact (there is enormous built in redundancy). Obviously, some contents will no longer be available (information channels will be affected). 
\par The interactivity of this medium is a guarantee against the monopolization of
 contents. Anyone with a thousand dollars can launch his/her own (reasonably sophisticated) site, accessible to all other Internet users. Space is available through home page providers. 
\par The name of the game is no longer the production - it is the creative content (design), the content itself and, above all, the marketing of the site. 
\par The Internet
 is an infinite and unlimited resource. This goes against the grain of the most basic economic concept (of scarcity). Each computer that joins the Internet strengthens it exponentially - and tens of thousands join daily. The Internet infrastructure (maybe
 
with the exception of communication backbones) can accommodate an annual growth of 100% to the year 2020. It is the user who decides whether to increase the Internet's infrastructure by connecting his computer to it. By comparison: it is as though it were
 possible to produce and to broadcast radio programmes from every radio receiver. Each computer is a combination of studio and transmitter (on the Internet). 
\par In reality, there is no other interactive medium except the Internet. Cable TV does not allow two-
way data transfer (from user to cable operator). If the user wants to buy a product - he has to phone. Interactive television is an abject failure (the Sony and TCI experiments were terminated). This all is notwithstanding the combining of the Internet wi
th satellite capabilities (VSAT) or with the revenant digital television. 
\par The television screen is inferior when compared to the computer screen. Only the Internet is there as a true two-way possibility. The technological problems that besieged it are slowly dissipating. 
\par The Internet allows for one-dimensional and bi - dimensional interactivity. 
\par One-dimensional interactivity: fill in and dispatch a form, send and receive messages (through e-mail or v-mail). 
\par Two-dimensional interactivity: to talk to someone while both parties work on an application, to see your conversant, to talk to him and to transfer documents to him for his perusal as the conversation continues apace. 
\par This is no longer science fiction. In less than five years this will be as common as
 the telephone - and it will have a profound effect on the traditional services provided by the phone companies. Internet phones, Internet videophones - they will be serious competitors and the phone companies are likely to react once they begin to feel t
he heat. This will happen when the Internet will acquire black box features. Phone companies, software giants and cable TV operators are likely to end up owning big chunks of the lucrative future market of the Net.

\par The Internet is NOT a popular medium. It is the medium of affluent executives who fully master the English language, as part of a wider general education. 
\par Alternatively, it is the medium of academia (students, lecturers), or of children of the former, well-to-do group. In any case, it is not the medium of the "wide public". It is also a highly individualistic medium. 
\par The Internet was an initiative of the DOD (Department of Defence in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}). It was later "requisitioned" by the National science Fund (NSF) in the 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. This continuous involvement of the administration came to an end in 1995 when the medium was "privatized". 
\par This "privatization" was a recognition of the civilian roots of the Internet. It was - and is still being - formed b
y millions of information-intoxicated users. They formed networks to exchange bits and pieces of mutual interest. Thus, as opposed to all other media, the Internet was not invented, nor was its market. The inventors of the telephone, the telegraph, the ra
dio, the television and the compact disc - all invented previously non-existent markets for their products. It took time, effort and money to convince consumers that they needed these "gadgets". 
\par By contrast, the Internet was invented by its own consumers and so was the market for it. Only when the latter was fully forged did producers and businessmen join in. Microsoft began to hesitantly test the internet waters only in 1995!

\par The Internet is the only medium with online memory, very much 
like the human brain. The memories of these two - the Net and the Brain - are immediately accessible. In both, it is stored in sites and in both, it does not grow old or is eliminated. It is possible to find sites which commemorate events the same way tha
t
 the human mind registers them. This is Net Memory. The history of a site can be reviewed. The Library of Congress stores the consecutive development phases of sites. The Internet is an amazing combination of data processing software, data, a record of al
l the activities which took place in connection with the data and the memory of these records. Only the human brain is recalled by these capacities: one language serves all these functions, the language of the neurones.

\par The following - apparently trivial - observation is critical: 
\par All the other media provide us with processed, censored, "clean" content. 
\par The Internet is a medium of raw materials, partly well organized (the rough equivalent of a newspaper) - and partly still in raw form, yesterday\rquote s supper. 
\par This is a result of the immediate and absolute access afforded each user: access to programm
ing and site publishing tools - as well as access to computer space on servers. This leads to varying degrees of quality of contents and content providers and this, in turn, prevents monopolization and cartelization of the information supply channels. }{

\par T
he users of the Internet are still undecided: do they prefer drafts or newspapers. They frequent well designed sites. There are even design competitions and awards. But they display a preference for sites that are constantly updated (i.e. closer in their 
nature to a raw material - rather than to a finished product). They prefer sites from which they can download material to quietly process at home, alone, on their PCs, at their leisure. 
\par Even the concept of "interactivity" points at a preference for raw materials with which one can interact. For what is interactivity if not the active involvement of the user in the creation of content? 
\par The Internet users love to be involved, to feel the power in their fingertips, they are all addicted to one form of power or another. 
\par Similarly, a car completely automatically driven and navigated is not likely to sell well. Part of the experience of driving - the sensation of power ("power stirring") - is critical to the purchase decision. 
\par It is not in vain that the metaphor for using the Internet is "surfing" (and not, let\rquote s say, browsing). 
\par The problem is that the Internet is still predominantly an English language medium (though it is fast changing). It discriminates against those whose mother tongue is different. All sof
tware applications work best in English. Otherwise they have to be adapted and fitted with special fonts (Hebrew, Arabic, Japanese, Russian and Chinese - each present a different set of problems to overcome). This situation might change with the attainmen

\par This is the first (though, probably, not the last) medium which allows the user to conduct his whole life within its boundaries. 
\par Television presents a clear division: there is a passive viewer. His task is to absorb information and subject it to minimal processing. The Internet embodies a complete and comprehensive (virtual) reality, a full fledged alternative to real life. 
\par The illusion is still in its infancy - and yet already powerful. 
\par The user can talk to others, see them, listen to music, see video, purchase goods and services, play games (alone or with others scattered around the globe), converse with colleagues, or with users
 with the same hobbies and areas of interest, to play music together (separated by time and space). 
\par And all this is very primitive. In ten years time, the Internet will offer its users the option of video conferencing (possibly, three dimensional, holographic). The participants\rquote 
 figures will be projected on big screens. Documents will be exchanged, personal notes, spreadsheets, secret counteroffers. 
\par Virtual Reality games will become reality in less time. Special end-user equipment will make the player bel
ieve that he, actually, is part of the game (while still in his room). The player will be able to select an image borrowed from a database and it will represent him, seen by all the other players. Everyone will, thus, end up invading everyone else\rquote

\par This is the first medium in history which does not require the simultaneous presence of people in space-time in order to facilitate the transfer of information. T
elevision requires the existence of studio technicians, narrators and others in the transmitting side - and the availability of a viewer in the receiving side. The phone is dependent on the existence of two or more parties simultaneously. 
\par With time, tools
 to bridge the time gap between transmitter and receiver were developed. The answering machine and the video cassette recorder both accumulate information sent by a transmitter - and release it to a receiver in a different space and time. But they are dis
crete, their storage volume is limited and they do not allow for interaction with the transmitter. 
\par The Internet does not have these handicaps. 
\par It facilitates the formation of "virtual organizations / institutions / businesses/ communities". These are groups of users that communicate in different points in space and time, united by a common goal or interest. 
\par A few examples:

 and with a French graphics office. They will all file their work (through the intranet) in the Net, to be studied by the other members of this virtual group. These will en
ter the right site after clearing a firewall security software. They will all be engaged in flexiwork (flexible working times) and work from their homes or offices, as they please. Obviously, they will all abide by a general schedule. 
\par They will exchange audio files (the jingle, for instance), graphics, video, colour photographs and text. They will comment on each other\rquote 
s work and make suggestions using e-mail. The client will witness the whole creative process and will be able to contribute to it. There is no technological obstacle preventing the participation of the client\rquote s clients, as well.

\par It is difficult to imagine that "virtual performances will replace real life ones. 
\par The mass rock concert has its own inimitable sounds, palette
 and smells. But a virtual production of a record is on the cards and it is tens of percents cheaper than a normal production. Again, the participants will interact through the Intranet. They will swap notes, play their own instruments, make comments by e
-
mail, play together using an appropriate software. If one of them is grabbed by inspiration in the middle of (his) night, he will be able to preserve and pass on his ideas through the Net. The creative process will be aided by novel applications which ena
b
le the simultaneous transfer of sound over the Net. The processes which are already digitized (the mix, for one) will pose no problem to a digitized medium. Other applications will let the users listen to the final versions and even ask the public for his
 preview opinion. 
\par Thus, even creative processes which are perceived as demanding human presence - will no longer do so with the advent of the Net.

\par Simultaneity and interactivity - this will be the name of the game in the Internet. The professional term is "Coopetition" (cooperation between potential competitors, using the Internet).

\par The Internet is the technological solution to the mythological "home entertainment centre" debate. 
\par It is alm
ost universally agreed that, in the future, a typical home will have one apparatus which will give it access to all types of information. Even the most daring did not talk about simultaneous access to all the types of information or about full interactivi
ty. 
\par The Internet will offer exactly this: access to every conceivable type of information simultaneously , the ability to process them at the same time and full interactivity. The future image of this home centre is fairly clear - it is the timing that is 
not. It is all dependent on the availability of a wide (information) band - through which it will be possible to transfer big amounts of data at high speeds, using the same communications line. Fast modems were coupled with optic fibres and with faulty pl
a
nning and vision of future needs. The cable television industry, for instance, is totally technologically unprepared for the age of interactivity. This is only partly the result of unwise, restrictive, legislation which prohibits data vendors from steppin
g on each others\rquote  toes. Phone companies were not permitted to provide Internet services or to transfer video through their wires - and cable companies were not allowed to transmit phone calls. 
\par It is a question of time until these fossilized remains are removed by the almighty hand of the market. When this happens, the home centre is likely to look like this: 
\par A central computer attached to a big screen divided to windows. Television is broadcast on one window. A software application is running on another. T
his could be an application connected to the television program (deriving data from it, recording it, collating it with pertinent data it picks out of databases). It could be an independent application (a computer game). 
\par Updates from the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}New York{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} Stock exchange flash at the corner of the screen and an icon blinks to signal the occurrence of a significant economic event. 

\par A click of the mouse (?) and the news flash is converted to a voice message. Another click and your broker is on the InternetPh
one (possibly seen in a third window on the screen). You talk, you send him a fax containing instructions and you compare notes. The fax was printed on a word processing application which opened up in yet another window. 
\par Many believe that communication wi
th the future generation of computers will be voice communication. This is difficult to believe. It is weird to talk to a machine (especially in the presence of other humans). We are seriously inhibited this way. Moreover, voice will interrupt other peopl
e\rquote s work or pleasure. It is also close to impossible to develop an efficient voice recognition software. Not to mention mishaps such as accidental activation.

\par The Internet will not escape the processes experienced by all other media. 
\par It will become easy to operate, user-friendly, in professional parlance. 
\par It requires too much specialized information. It is not accessible to those who lack basic hardware and (Windows) software concepts. 
\par Alas, most of the population falls into the la
tter category. Only 30 million "Windows" operating systems were sold worldwide at the end of 1996. Even if this constitutes 20% of all the copies (the rest being pirated versions) - it still represents less than 3% of the population of the world. And this
, needless to say, is the world's most popular software (following the DOS operating system). 
\par The Internet must rely on something completely different. It must have sophisticated, transparent-to-the-user search engines to guide to the cavernous chaotic lib
raries which will typify it. The search engines must include complex decision making algorithms. They must understand common languages and respond in mundane speech. They will be efficient and incredibly fast because they will form their own search strate
gy (supplanting the user\rquote s faulty use of syntax). 
\par These engines, replete with smart agents will refer the user to additional data, to cultural products which reflect the user\rquote s history of preferences (or pronounced preferences expressed in answers to feedb
ack questionnaires). All the decisions and activities of the user will be stored in the memory of his search engine and assist it in designing its decision making trees. The engine will become an electronic friend, advise the user, even on professional ma
tters. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid4785983\charrsid16322966

\par The cessation of hostilities between the Internet and some off-the-shelf software applications heralds the commencement of the integration between the desktop computer and the Net. This is a small step for the user - and a big one for 
humanity. The animosity which prevailed until recently between the UNIX systems and the HTML language and between most of the standard applications (headed by the Word Processors) - has officially ended with the introduction of Office 97 which incorporate
s
 full HTML capabilities. With the Office 2000 products, the distinctions between a web computing environment and a PC computing one - have all but vanished. Browsers can replace operating systems, word processors can browse, download and upload - the PC h
as finally been entirely absorbed by its offspring, the internet. 
\par The Portable Document Format (PDF) enables the user to work the Internet off-line. In other words: text files will be loaded to word processors and edited off-line. The same applies to other types of files (audio, video). 
\par Downloading time will be speeded up (today, it takes so long to download an audio or video file that, many times, it is impracticable). 
\par This is not a trivial matter. The ability to switch between on-line and off-line states and to continue the work, uninterrupted - this ability means the integration of the PC in the Internet. 
\par There are two competing views concerning the future of computer hardware and both of them acknowledge the importance of the Internet. 
\par Bill Gates - Microsoft\rquote 
s legendary boss - says that the PC will continue to advance and strengthen its processing and computing powers. The Internet will be just another tool available through telecommunications, rather than through the ownership of hard copies of softw
are and data. The Internet is perceived to be a tremendous external database, available for processing by tomorrow\rquote s desktops. This view is lately being gradually reversed in view of the incredible vitality and powers of the Internet. 
\par Gates is converging on the worldview held by Sun Microsystems. 
\par The future desktop will be a terminal, albeit powerful and with considerable processing, computing and communications capabilities. The name of the g
ame will be the Internet itself. The terminal will access Internet databases (containing raw or processed data) and satisfy its information needs. 
\par This terminal - equipped with languages the likes of Java - will get into libraries of software applications
. It will make use of components of different applications as the needs arise. When finished using the component, the terminal will "return" it to the virtual "shelf" until the next time it is needed. 
\par This will minimize memory resources in the desktop. 
\par The truth, as always, is probably somewhere in the middle. 
\par Tomorrow\rquote s computer will be a home entertainment centre. No consumer will accept total dependence on telecommunications and on the Net. They will all ask for processing and computing powers at their fingertips, a-la Bill Gates. 
\par But tomorrow\rquote s computer will also function as a terminal, when needed: when data retrieving or even when using NON standard software applications. Why purchase rarely used, expensive applications - when they are available, f
or a fraction of the cost, on the Net? 
\par In other words: no consumer will subjugate his frequent word processing needs to the whims of the local phone company, or to those of the site operator. That is why every desktop is still likely to be include a hard 
(or optical)-disk-resident word processing software. But very few will by CAD-CAM, animation, graphics, or publishing software which they are likely to use infrequently. Instead, they will access these applications, which will be resident in the Net, use 
those parts that are needed. This is usage tailored to the client\rquote s needs. This is also the integration of a desktop (not of a terminal) with the Net. 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 Decentralized Lack of Planning}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966  
\par The course adopted by content creators (producers) in the last few years 
proves the maxim that it is easy to repeat mistakes and difficult to derive lessons from them. Content producers are constantly buying channels to transfer their contents. This is a mistake. A careful study of the history of successful media (e.g., televi
sion) points to a clear pattern: 
\par Content producers do not grant life-long exclusivity to any single channel. Especially not by buying into it. They prefer to contract for a limited time with content providers (their broadcast channels). They work with all 
of them, sometimes simultaneously. 
\par In the future, the same content will be sold on different sites or networks, at different times. Sometimes it will be found with a provider which is a combination of cable TV company and phone company - at other times, i
t will be found with a provider with expertise in computer networks. Much content will be created locally and distributed globally - and vice versa. The repackaging of branded contents will be the name of the game in both the media firms and the firms whi
ch control contents distribution (=the channels).

No exclusivity pact will survive. Networks such as CompuServe are doomed and have been doomed since 1993. The approach of decentralized access, through numerous channels, to the same information - will prevail.

\par The Internet will become the next battlefield between have countries and have-not countries. It will be a cultural war zone (English against French, Japanese, Chinese, Russian and Spanish). It will be politically charged: th
ose wishing to restrict the freedom of speech (authoritarian and dictatorial regimes, governments, conservative politicians) against pro-speechers. It will become a new arena of warfare and an integral part of actual wars. 
\par Different peer groups, educational and income social-economic strata, ethnic, sexual preference groups - will all fight in the eternal fields of the Internet. 
\par Yet, two developments are likely to pacify the scene: 
\par Automatic translation applications (like Accent and the Alta Vista transl
ation engines) will make every bit of information accessible to all. The lingual (and, by extension ethnic or national) source of the information will be disguised. A feeling of a global village will permeate the medium. Being ignorant of the English lang
uage will no longer hinder one\rquote s access to the Net. Equal opportunities. 
\par The second trend will be the new classification methods of contents on the Net together with the availability of chips intended to filter offensive information. Obscene material will 
not be available to tender souls. anti-Semitic sites will be blocked to Jews and communists will be spared Evil Empire speeches. Filtering will be usually done using extensive and adaptable lists of keywords or key phrases. 
\par This will lead to the formation of cultural Internet Ghettos - but it will also considerably reduce tensions and largely derail populist legislative efforts aimed at curbing or censoring free speech. 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch \b\i\insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966 Public Internet - Private Internet}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid12470065\charrsid16322966  
\par The day is not far when every user will be able to
 define his areas of interest, order of priorities, preferences and tastes. Special applications will scour the Net for him and retrieve the material befitting his requirements. This material will be organized in any manner prescribed. 
\par A private newspaper comes to mind. It will have a circulation of one copy - the user\rquote 
s. It will borrow its contents from a few hundreds of databases and electronic versions of newspapers on the Net. Its headlines will reflect the main areas of interest of its sole subscriber
. The private paper will contain hyperlinks to other sites in the Internet: to reference material, to additional information on the same subject. It will contain text, but also graphics, audio, video and photographs. It will be interactive and editable wi
th the push of a button. 
\par Another idea: the intelligent archive. 
\par The user will accumulate information, derived from a variety of sources in an archive maintained for him on the Net. It will not be a classical "dead" archive. It will be active. A special ap
plication will search the Net daily and update the archive. It will contain hyperlinks to sites, to additional information on the Net and to alternative sources of information. It will have a "History" function which will teach the archive about the prefe
rences and priorities of the user. 
\par The software will recommend new sites to him and subjects similar to his history. It will alert him to movies, TV shows and new musical releases - all within his cultural sphere. If convinced to purchase - the software wi
ll order the wares from the Net. It will then let him listen to the music, see the movie, or read the text. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \insrsid4785983\charrsid16322966

\par The internet will become a place of unceasing stimuli, of internal order and organization and of friendliness in the sense of personally rewardin
g acquaintance. Such an archive will be a veritable friend. It will alert the user to interesting news, leave messages and food for thought in his e-mail (or v-mail). It will send the user a fax if not responded to within a reasonable time. It will issue 
reports every morning. 
\par This, naturally, is only a private case of the archival potential of the Net. 
\par A network connecting more than 16.3 million computers (end 1996) is also the biggest collective memory effort in history after the Library of Alexandria. 
The Internet possesses the combined power of all its constituents. Search engines are, therefore, bound to be replaced by intelligent archives which will form universal archives, which will store all the paths to the results of searches plus millions of r
ecommended searches. 
\par Compare this to a newspaper: it is much easier to store back issues of a paper in the Internet than physically. Obviously, it is much easier to search and the amortization of such a copy is annulled. Such an archive will let the user s
earch by word, by key phrase, by contents, search the bibliography and hop to other parts of the archive or to other territories in the Internet using hyperlinks.

\par We have already mentioned SET, the safety standard. This will facilitate credi
t card transactions over the Net. These are safe transactions even today - but there an ingrained interest to say otherwise. Newspapers are afraid that advertising budgets will migrate to the Web. Television harbours the same fears. More commerce on the N
e
t - means more advertising dollars diverted from established media. Too many feel unhappy when confronted with this inevitability. They spread lies which feed off the ignorance about how safe paying with credit cards on the Net is. Safety standards will t
erminate this propaganda and transform the Internet into a commercial medium. 
\par Users will be able to buy and sell goods and services on the Net and get them by post. Certain things will be directly downloaded (software, e-books). Many banking transactions a
nd EDI operations will be conducted through bank-clients intranets. All stock and commodity exchanges will be accessible and the role of brokers will be minimized. Foreign exchange will be easily tradable and transferable. Initial Public Offerings of shar
e
s, day trading of stocks and other activities traditionally connected with physical ("pit") capital markets will become a predominant feature of the internet. The day is not far that the likes of Merill Lynch will be offering full services (including advi
s
ory services) through the internet. The first steps towards electronic trading of shares (with discounted fees) have already been taken in mid 1999. Home banking, private newspapers, subscriptions to cultural events, tourism packages and airline tickets -
 are all candidates for Net-Trading.

The "Internet" is a very misleading term. It's like saying "print". Professional articles are "print" - and so are the sleaziest porno brochures. 
\par So, first, I think it would be useful to make a distinction between two broad categories: 
\par Content-related\line or\line Content-driven and Interaction-driven 
\par Most content driven sites maintain reasonable ethical standards, roughly comparable to the "real" or "non-virtual" media. This is because many of these sites were established by businesses with a "real" dimension to 
start with (Walt Disney, The Economist, etc.). These sites (at least the institutional ones) maintain standards of privacy, veracity, cross-checking of information, etc. 
\par Personal home pages would be a sub-category of content-driven sites. These cannot be 
seriously considered "media". They are representatives of the new phenomenon of extreme narrowcasting. They do not adhere to any ethical standards, with the exception of those upheld by their owners'. 
\par The interaction orientated sites and activities can, in turn, be divided to E-commerce sites (such as Amazon) which adhere to commercial law and to commercial ethics and to interactive sites. 
\par The latter - discussion lists, mailing lists and so on - are a hotbed of unethical, verbally aggressive, hostile behaviour. A special vocabulary developed to discuss these phenomena ("flaming", "mail bombing" etc.). 
\par To summarize: 
\par Where the aim is to provide consumers with another venue for the dissemination of information or to sell products or services to them the sta
ndards of ethics maintained reflect those upheld outside the realm of the internet. Additionally, codified morals, the commercial law is adhered to. 
\par Where the aim is interaction or the dissemination of the personal opinions and views of site-owners - ethi
cal standards are in the process of becoming. A rough set of guidelines coalesced into the "netiquette". It is a set of rules of peaceful co-existence intended to prevent flame wars and the eruption of interpersonal verbal abuse. Since it lacks effective 
means of enforcement - it is very often violated and constitutes an expression of goodwill, rather than an obliging code.

\par 1. }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057\insrsid10295183\charrsid16322966 Internet Invasion }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057\insrsid10295183\charrsid16322966 
\par The penetration of the Internet in the countries in transition varies from country t
o country - but is still very low even by European standards, not to mention by American ones. This had to do with the lack of infrastructure, the prohibitive cost of services, an extortionist pricing structure, computer illiteracy and luddism (computer p
h
obia). Societies in the countries in transition are inert (and most of them, conservative or traditionalist) - following years of central mis-planning. The Internet (and computers) are perceived by many as threatening - mainly because they are part of a t
echnological upheaval which makes people redundant. 
\par 2. }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057\insrsid10295183\charrsid16322966 The Rumour Mill}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057\insrsid10295183\charrsid16322966  
\par All manner of instant messaging - mainly the earlier versions of IRC - played an important role in enhancing social cohesion and exchanging uncensored information. As in other parts of
 the world - the Internet was first used to communicate: IRC, MIRC e-mail and e-mail fora were - and to a large extent, are - all the rage. 
\par The IRC was (and is) used mainly to exchange political views and news and to engage in inter-personal interactions.
 The media in countries in transition is notoriously unreliable. Decades of official indoctrination and propaganda left people reading between (real or imaginary) lines. Rumours and gossip always substituted for news and the Internet was well suited to be
c
ome a prime channel of dissemination of conspiracy theories, malicious libel, hearsay and eyewitness accounts. Instant messaging services also led to an increase in the number (though not necessarily in the quality) of interactions between the users - fro
m
 dating to the provision of services, the Internet was enthusiastically adopted by a generation of alienated youth, isolated from the world by official doctrine and from each other by paranoia fostered by the political regime. The Internet exposed its use
r
s to the west, to other models of existence where trust and collaboration play a major role. It increase the quantity of interaction between them. It fostered a sense of identity and community. The Internet is not ubiquitous in the countries in transition
 and, therefore, its impact is very limited. It had no discernible effect on how governments work in this region. Even in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 it is just starting to effect political processes and be integrated in them. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057\insrsid4785983\charrsid16322966

\par The Internet encouraged entr
epreneurship and aspirations of social mobility. Very much like mobile telephony - which allowed the countries in transition to skip massive investments in outdated technologies - the Internet was perceived to be a shortcut to prosperity. Its decentralize
d channels of distribution, global penetration, "rags to riches" ethos and dizzying rate of innovation - attracted the young and creative. Many decided to become software developers and establish local version of "{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
Silicon Valley{\*\xmlclose}" or the flourishing software industry in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}India{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. Anti virus software was developed in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Russia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, web design services in former {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Yugoslavia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, e-media in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Czech Republic{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and so on. But this is the reserve of 
a minuscule part of society. E-commerce, for instance, is a long way off (though m-commerce might be sooner in countries like the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Czech Republic{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 or the Baltic). 
\par E-commerce is the natural culmination of a process. You need to have a rich
 computer infrastructure, a functioning telecommunications network, cheap access to the Internet, computer literacy, inability to postpone gratification, a philosophy of consumerism and, finally, a modicum of trust between the players in the economy. The 
c
ountries in transition lack all of the above. Most of them are not even aware that the Internet exists and what it can do for them. Penetration rates, number of computers per household, number of phone lines per household, the reliability of the telecommu
n
ications infrastructure and the number of Internet users at home (and at work)- are all dismally low. On the other hand, the cost of accessing the net is still prohibitively high. It would be a wild exaggeration to call the budding Internet enterprises in
 
the countries in transition - "industries". There are isolated cases of success, that's all. They sprang in response to local demand, expanded internationally on rare occasions and, on the whole remained pretty confined to their locale. There was no agree
ment between countries and entrepreneurs who will develop what. It was purely haphazard. 
\par 3. }{\rtlch \ab\af0 \ltrch \b\cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057\insrsid10295183\charrsid16322966 The Great Equalizer}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057\insrsid10295183\charrsid16322966  
\par Very early on, the denizens of the countries in transition have caught on to the "great equalizer" effects of the Net. They used it to vent the
ir frustrations and aggression, to conduct cyber-warfare, to unleash an explosion of visual creativity and to engage in deconstructive discourse. 
\par By great equalizer - I meant equalizer with the rich, developed countries. See the article I quoted above. Th
e citizens of the countries in transition are frustrated by their inability to catch up with the affluence and prosperity of the West. They feel inferior, neglected, looked down upon, dictated to and, in general, put down. The Internet is perceived as som
ething which can restore the balance. Only, of course, it cannot. It is still a rich people's medium. President Clinton points out the Digital Divide within {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}America{\*\xmlclose}
{\*\xmlclose} - such a divide exists to a much larger extent and with more venomous eff
ects between the developed and developing world. the Internet has done nothing to bridge this gap - on the contrary: It enhanced the productivity and economic growth (this is known as "The New Economy") of rich countries (mainly the States) and left the h
ave-nots in the dust. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057\insrsid4785983\charrsid16322966

\par The concept of intellectual property - foreign to the global Internet culture to start with - became an emblem of Western hegemony and monopolistic practices. Violating copyright, software piracy and hackin
g became both status symbols and a political declaration of sorts. But the rapid dissemination of programs and information (for instance, illicit copies of reference works) served to level the playing field. 
\par Piracy of material is quite prevalent in the countries in transition. The countries in transition are the second capital of piracy (after {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Asia{\*\xmlclose}
). Software, films, even books - are copied and distributed quite freely and openly. There are street vendors who deal in the counterfeit products - but most of it is sold through stores and OEMs. 
\par I think that intellectual property will go the way the pharmaceutical industry did: Instead of fighting windmills - owners and distributors of intellectual property will join the trend. They are likely to team up w
ith sponsors which will subsidize the price of intellectual property in order to make it affordable to the denizens of poor countries. Such sponsors could be either multi-lateral institutions (such as the World Bank) - or charities and donors. }{\rtlch

\af0 \ltrch \insrsid12081915\charrsid16322966 In many countries in transition cellular phones are more ubiquitous than the fixed-line kind. Teledensity is vanishingly low throughou
t swathes of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Broadband and e-commerce are distant rumors (ISDN is available in theory but not so in practice - DSL and ADSL are not available at all). Rare phone lines - especially in urban centers - are still being multi
p
lexed and shared by 4-8 subscribers, greatly reducing both quality and usability. Terrestrial television competes ferociously with satellite TV, though cable penetration is low. Internet access is prohibitively expensive and intermittent. Many technologie
s rely on network effects (i.e., a critical mass of users). CEE is far from reaching this elusive point.
\par When communism imploded in 1989, pundits were quick to spot the silver lining. The countries in transition, they said, could now leapfrog whole stages o
f development by adopting novel technologies and through them the expensive Western research they embody. The East can learn from the West's mistakes and, by avoiding them, achieve a competitive edge.
\par In his seminal book, "Leapfrogging Development - The Po
litical Economy of Telecommunications Restructuring", J.P. Singh, examined the acceleration of development through the adoption of ready-made, off the shelf, technologies. His melancholy conclusion was that development preferences are the outcomes of an i
ntricate inter-play between sectoral pressure groups and coalitions of interest groups - and not the result of progress ex machina. He distinguished three types of states - catalytic, near-catalytic, and dysfunctional. Though he deals exclusively with 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Asia{\*\xmlclose} and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Latin America{\*\xmlclose}, his typology is applicable to post-Communist {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Europe{\*\xmlclose}.

\par The Central and East European market will
 double itself (to $17 billion) by 2003, says IDC. Pyramid Research predicts a $60 billion communications market by 2005. "Information Society", ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), "leapfrogging", and "better online than in line" are buzzwor
d
s and slogans oft-used throughout the region. A horde of NGO's - local and international - collaborate with domestic government and local authorities, with foreign governments, multinationals, and international organizations to make the dream of a digital
 Europe come true. 
\par {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Russia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 pledged to attract $33 billion in investments in its telecommunications infrastructure and services by the year 2010 (the "Electronic Russia" initiative). The US Commercial Service, in the American Embassy in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Moscow{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
, predicts an annual growth rate of the Russian ICT sector of 15-20 percent through 2003. Conferences abound (an important one regarding municipal collaboration in constructing an information highway is to be held in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname 
City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Czech{\*\xmlclose} {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Republic{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} on March 26-27).

{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Silicon Valley{\*\xmlclose} household names such as Credence, HP
L, and Virage Logic. More than 4000 professionals are employed in 200 companies. Of 60 software development outfits - 26 were founded with American capital. LEDA, a prominent local IT firm, finances IT programs at the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}

.
\par All EU candidates strive to get incorporated in existing European networks (such as ELANET, Telecities, IDA, and ERISA) and new, candidate-only, initiatives (such as eEurope+). The EU has applied its "universal (i.
e., also affordable) service" rule to Internet access. EU members adopted a variety of measures to increase Internet awareness and usage. {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Portugal{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
, for instance, granted individuals with tax incentives coupled with free e-mail accounts a
nd Web hosting services to encourage them to purchase PC's. The Dutch established public computer literacy centers for the disenfranchised (e.g., the unemployed) and provided them with discounted and subsidized hardware and connection time. 
\par In one of its more grandiose moments, the heads of governments of the EU countries have decided in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Lisbon{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 (2000) that "each citizen should have access to the Internet and the whole European Union should become computer-literate", in the words of the Czech conference organizers. 
\par This is an ambitious undertaking not only because {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Europe{\*\xmlclose} in general is behind the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 where Internet matters (with the exception of wireless Internet) are concerned - but because the countries which used to be behind the Iron Curtain, now lurch in the Digital Divide. 
\par According to Vasile Baltac from the Information Technology and Communications Association of Romania ("The Balkan and Eastern {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Europe{\*\xmlclose} - Digital Divide or Digital Opportunity"), {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Romania{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} has invested $25 per capita in ICT in 1999 (compared to {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Greece{\*\xmlclose}
{\*\xmlclose}'s $567 and the EU's average of $1215). There were only 2.5 Internet users per 1000 inhabitants in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Romania{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Bulgaria{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} - compared to 56.4 in Westward-looking {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Slovenia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}.
\par New technologies are used mostly by the elites in CEE (as pointed out by Zassourski and Vartanova in "Transformation in the Context of Transition") - and perhaps advertently so. Still, Baltac finge
rs the managerial class as the main obstacle to leapfrogging (i.e., the rapid dissemination and assimilation of advanced technologies). They pay lip service to modernization but feel threatened and repelled by it. On the positive side, Baltac notes the an
nual yield of qualified professionals (who mostly find work in the West) and the emergence of telework and e-commerce. The technological vacuum makes the CEE countries receptive to state of the art technologies. GSM penetration in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Romania{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} surpassed the level of fixed line coverage in 1989. The number of cable TV subscribers in the region is projected to double (to 20 million) by 2005. 
\par But the true picture is often obscured by anecdotal evidence, wishful thinking, phobias (e.g., the West European fear of mass migration from {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}East Europe{\*\xmlclose}
), lack of reliable statistics, and absence of qualified analysts and investment bankers. Factors like hostile terrain and climate, cross-subsidies, lack of real competition, corruption, red tape, moribun
d financial systems, archaic legal ones, dearth of credit card holders, urban-rural gaps, and English language illiteracy - rarely appear in neat, colorful, presentations.
\par Pyramid Research is bearish on broadband. "Internet access is and will remain for the foreseeable future a predominantly narrowband, dial-up affair, even in the most advanced countries (in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Central Europe{\*\xmlclose}
)". This despite plans by regional operators to offer DSL, FWA (Fixed Wireless Access), cable TV and leased-line broadband access (a
lready offered in the Czech Republic by cable networks) and despite a regulatory welcome in all three CE candidates (Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic). 
\par Luckily, mobile telephony - the other pillar of the leapfrogging theory - is getting increasingly concentrated in the hands of fewer operators (though at least 3 per every major market). Pyramid projects that by 2006, 94 percent of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Russia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}'s cellular phone market will be in the hands of the five leading providers (compared to 85 per
cent at the end of 2001). Mobile penetration will increase (to c. 10 percent) and prepaid customers will account for the vast majority of users. 
\par Revenues from cellular networks exceed revenues from fixed line networks in certain markets. SMS is booming. S
econd and third mobile operator licenses are tendered by all cash strapped governments in the region (though a Polish attempt to sell an UMTS license ended in a fiasco). {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Poland
{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} introduced a wireless local loop service. {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Macedonia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} just handed a second mobile operator license to the Greek OTE.
\par "By the end of 2005, the total number of mobile subscribers in CEE will exceed 50 million (compared to 30 million by end-2001) and mobile Internet accounts will constitute approximately 21 percent of total mobile accounts", projects Pyramid. The 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Czech{\*\xmlclose} {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Republic{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} will have 78 mobile users per 100 population - and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City
}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Hungary{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} 66. In a second tier of countries - the likes of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Bulgaria{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Romania{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Ukraine{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Russia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} - a mobile phone will remain a luxury and a status symbol.
\par Hitherto domestic operators - from the Greek OTE to the Russian MTS - are becoming regional. Multinationals, 
such as the British Vodafone and the French Orange - have entered the regional fray. Some CEE markets are as saturated (and customers as savvy and demanding) as many advanced Western European ones.\~
 A host of value added services (VAS) is thrust upon the - sometimes reluctant - users, leading naturally to WAP (recently introduced throughout much of CEE), 2.5G, and 3G (wi-fi or wireless Internet) services.
\par Moreover, Pyramid sees an intriguing opportunity in VoIP (Voice over IP) telephony. It says:
\par "As the incumbents in the CEE markets continue to dominate long-distance circuit-switched telephony, VoIP offers a unique opportunity for new operators to gain a foothold in this traditional monopolistic stronghold."
\par Internet Telephony Service Providers (ITSP's) have sprung up all over the region (an Israeli firm is now planning to offer VoIP services in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Macedonia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
, Kosovo, and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Albania{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}). Even incumbents have been offering VoIP - as early as 1998 in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}Czech{\*\xmlclose} {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Republic{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
. In his keynote address to The Economist CEE Telecommunications Conference, in December 2001, Ofer Gneezy, President and CEO of iBasis (a global ITSP), cited industry analysts projecting VoIP average annual growth rates in CEE of 80 percent through 2006.

\par \page 
\par This, coupled with a growing number of Internet users and access providers (spurred on by telecoms liberalization and growing incomes), may revolutionize the landscape in the next 5-10 years. Pyramid expects annual Internet adoption growth rates
 of 40 percent through 2005 (that's 30,000 new users a day!). Internet related revenues will reach $10 billion by 2005 (five times today's $1.8 billion - but only one seventh the Internet market in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Western Europe
{\*\xmlclose}). 
\par Internet penetration in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Central Europe{\*\xmlclose} will reach 15 percent in 2005 (from 4 percent today and 3 percent in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Russia{\*\xmlclose}
{\*\xmlclose}) - and 40 percent in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Western Europe{\*\xmlclose} (compared to 18 percent today). Mobile Internet accounts will constitute one third of the total in CEE - c. 20 
million users. Harald Gruber of the European Investment Bank is even more optimistic, saying ("Competition and Innovation: The Diffusion of Telecommunications in CEE", March 2000): "About 20 percent of the population will adopt mobile telecommunications".

\par Technology is a social phenomenon with social implications
. It fosters entrepreneurship and social mobility. By allowing the countries in transition to skip massive investments in outdated technologies - the cellular phone, the Internet, cable TV, and the satellite came to be perceived as shortcuts to prosperity
, the generators of the dual ethoses of "rags to riches", and "creative destruction" (dizzying, constant, and disruptive innovation). They are the future, a youthful promise, and a landscape of opportunities.
\par Software developers in CEE countries tried to establish local versions of "{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Silicon Valley{\*\xmlclose}", or the flourishing software industry in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname 
City}}India{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. Russian entrepreneurs developed anti virus software, Yugoslavs offered web design services, electronic media flourished in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
Czech Republic{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and so on. But, as hard reality set in, most of these talents left for {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Western Europe{\*\xmlclose}, the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname 
City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Canada{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Australia{\*\xmlclose}
{\*\xmlclose} - where technology firms snatched them eagerly. Central and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Eastern Europe{\*\xmlclose} is a major net exporter of engineers, programmers, systems analysts, Web designers, and concepts analysts.
\par Internet penetration in these countries\~ - even in the most wired - is still very low by European standards, let alone Americ
an ones. The trauma of communism left them with decrepit and rarefied infrastructure, a prohibitive, extortionist, and skewed cost structure, computer illiteracy, inefficient competition, insufficient investment capital, and entrenched luddism (e.g., comp
uter phobia). Foreign operators often exacerbate the situation. ArmenTel, the Greek owned monopoly in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Armenia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
, keeps Internet access costs prohibitively high, ignoring court actions by the government and loud complaints by disgruntled customers.
\par The Center for Democracy and Technology (in its report "Bridging the Digital Divide: Internet Access in Central and Eastern Europe") says that, as contrasted with India (or Malaysia), the countries of the CEE did not invest in computerizing their s
chools, public libraries, and higher education institutions, or in subsidizing private computer-training colleges. 
\par More crucially and less reversibly, decades of central (mis-)planning rendered the societies of Central and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Eastern Europe{\*\xmlclose} inert and de
pendent, apart from their traditional conservatism. Many - especially older mid- and high-level managers and engineers - feel threatened by technology. Technology makes people redundant. 
\par To a few open minded (i.e., foreign owned) firms, computer networkin
g stands for decentralized channels of distribution and marketing as well as potential global penetration. But even there, only a minuscule number of businesses took advantage of e-commerce (though the countries of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
Central Europe{\*\xmlclose} and the Baltic may be the global pioneers of m-commerce due to their wireless networks). 
\par E-commerce is leapfrogging's litmus test because it represents the culmination and confluence of hardware, software, and proc
ess engineering. To have e-commerce, a country needs rich computer infrastructure, a functioning telecommunications network, and cheap access to the Internet. Its citizens need to be reasonably computer literate, possess both a consumerist mentality (e.g.
, inability to postpone gratification), and a modicum of trust between the players in the economy - and hold credit cards. 
\par Alas, the countries in transition lack all of the above to varying degrees. The Economist Intelligence Unit ranked {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Russia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 42nd (out of 60 countries) in its year 2000 "e-readiness survey". Other CEE countries fared little better.
\par Penetration and coverage rates (the number of computers and phone lines per household), network reliability, and the absolute number of Inter
net users - are all dismally low. Access fees are prohibitively high. Budding Internet enterprises in the countries in transition are happy exceptions that prove the depressing rule. They usually respond to erratic local demand. Few have expanded internat
ionally. Even fewer engage in research and development. 
\par Technology was supposed to be the great equalizer (with the rich, developed countries). It did not deliver on this promise. Unable to catch up with Western affluence and prosperity, the denizens of CE
E are frustrated. They feel inferior, neglected, looked down upon, dictated to, and, in general, put down. New, ever-cheaper, technologies, thought the locals, would surely restore the rightful balance between impoverished East and filthy rich West. But t
he Internet - and even technologies such as cellular telephony - belong to those who can effectively deploy them (i.e., consumers in developed, infrastructure-rich, countries). 
\par The news get worse.
\par The Internet is gradually permeated by commercial interests and going wireless. This convergence of content and business interests - means less access to the underprivileged.\~ The digital divide is growing by the day.\~
 New technologies have done little to bridge this gap - on the contrary: they enhanced the productivity and economic growth (this is known as "The New Economy") of rich countries (mainly the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}United States{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}) and left the have-nots in the dust. 
\par \page 
\par The countries in transition also lack the proper legislative and law enforcement infrastr
ucture (backed by the right cultural background). Property rights, contracts, intellectual property - are all new, often indigestible, concepts, emblems of Western hegemony and monopolistic practices. Widespread copyright violation, software piracy, and h
acking are both status symbols and political declarations of sorts. Admittedly, the dissemination of illicit intellectual products may have served to level the playing field. But now it is hindering entrepreneurship and holding back development.
\par After {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Asia{\*\xmlclose}
, the countries in transition are the second largest centre of piracy. Software, films, even books - are copied and distributed quite freely and openly. There are street vendors who deal in the counterfeit products - but most of it is sold through stor
es and OEMs. This despite massive efforts (e.g., in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Russia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Bulgaria
{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Ukraine{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, and, lately, in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Macedonia{\*\xmlclose}
{\*\xmlclose}) by software developers, licensed film libraries, and distributors - to fight these phenomena. 
\par Intellectual property may go the way the pharmaceutical industry has. Content owners and distributors may team up with sponsors (multilateral institutions, private charities and donors). The latter will subsidize intellectual property 
and, thus, make it affordable to the denizens of poor countries. This is already happening in scholarly publishing. 
\par This is very promising. But it far from leapfrogging development. In hindsight, leapfrogging may have been nothing but another of those intellectual fads whose time has gone before it ever came.

\fs27\cf1 Telecommunications is the most important phys
ical infrastructure in the modern world. It is more important than roads because it can replace them. It is more important than office buildings because it allows for the formation of virtual offices. It is more crucial than legal and institutional system
s because it surpasses national borders and undermines and subverts fossilized political structures.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 Telecommunications eliminates distance and allows for the transfer of voice and other forms of information (data) virtually at the speed of light. It is the
 foundation for the future industries and the industries of the future: information, knowledge and intelligent data processing industries.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 Telecommunications today is not limited to handsets, phone lines and telephony equipment. It incorporates computers and other media technologies. All these are an integral part of the new age of telecoms.}{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 Telecommunications was partly responsible to the geopolitical sea changes of the last decade. It is enough to recall the role of satellite telephones in the media cover
age of the televised Gulf War - or the anti Ceausescu revolution in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Romania{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 These are precisely the reasons why regimes all over the world - in other words, politicians - strove to maintain unmitigated control of the PTT services in the
ir countries and to block foreign and domestic competition. National telecommunication service providers and carriers became monopolistic monsters, operating highly inefficiently, charging exorbitant prices, employing far too many people at unreasonably h
igh salaries and serving to boost the political fortunes of ministers and the like.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 But all this is changing. The new World Trade Organization (WTO) set of agreements will force governments throughout the world to privatize their telecoms giants and to dere
gulate this industry. The deadline is 2003 with a few exceptions ({\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Latvia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 has until 2013 to do so). There is a new realizations that telecommunications is too important an industry to be left to the devices of politicians - or to the flawed management of state organs.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 A few privatization models have evolved over the last 20 years, or so.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 In the more developed countries (the West, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}South East Asia{\*\xmlclose}), some countries have chosen to introduce free for all competition. This entails the sal
e of part or all of the state owned telecoms provider to shareholders through stock exchanges. A small part is usually also allocated to the workers and management of the company at favourable prices. Concurrently the industry is deregulated and licensing
 requirements are gradually abolished.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 Initially, in this model, only certain services are open to competition, mainly the international calls segment and the mobile and wireless telephony (including paging).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 But, ultimately, all types of services are opened to competition - both domestic or foreign.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 The most extreme example is {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Finland{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
, where competition is completely free, no licensing is required and 52 companies compete for the heart (and pocket) of the customers. They are all allowed to offer any kind of telecommunications service imaginable.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 Still, very much the same situation is developing in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Israel{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Britain{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Australia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Hong Kong{\*\xmlclose}
 and - with the 1996 Telecommunications Act - in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
. This 1996 Act allows providers and carriers of international phone calls and of local phone calls (until now separated by regulation) to enter each other markets and compete. The result was a major spate of mergers and acqui
sitions as companies scrambled to offer combined, international and local, services.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 The second alternative is to break up the national carriers into functional units, one dedicated to international calls and the other to local traffic. NTT in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}Japan{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} is undergoing this surgical restructuring now. In the wake of this break-up, competition is allowed in certain services (again, mainly international calls and GSM and mobile telephony).}{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 The other - less efficient - option is to sell minority s
takes in the national carrier to investors (domestic or foreign), or, through the stock exchanges - while effectively preserving the monopoly of state owned provider. This was the case in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}Israel{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, until lately and is the case in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Greece{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. In {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}Israel{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
, when the British Cables and wireless tried to gain control of Bezeq (the Israeli phone services provider) - it encountered the staunch opposition of the Israeli government, replete with threats of legal action.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 Still, the benefits of privatization are enormous.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 Prices drop. That is the most evident and immediately visible effect. The prices charged for international phone calls in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Israel{\*\xmlclose}
{\*\xmlclose} dropped by 80% in real terms with the introduction of two additional competitors. In {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Britain{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, prices went down by 25%.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 There is a leap forward in the quality of service: waiting periods for new installations, second and third phone numbers, business dedicated lines, maintenance, fixing prob
lems, times between faults, troubleshooting, hotlines, meter reading, detailed and allocated accounts and so on. The average wait for a new phone has been reduced in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Israel
{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Hungary{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, to take two notable examples, from months to days.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 Naturally, overall economic efficiency is improved by cost savings and by more productive allocation of time previously spent on tackling bureaucratic hassles.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 Last, but by no means least, is the marked improvement in technology, its upgrading and the introduction of novel, low cost alternatives.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 In the less developed and developing countries, privatization has been achieved mainly through the introduction of foreign strategic partners - usually other telecoms firms from more developed
 countries. This necessitates the temporary preservation of the monopolies. No profit minded foreign investor will invest in infrastructure - and let future competitors reap the benefits. An investor wants to be assured that he will continue to rule the m
a
rket and overcharge the customers for a proscribed period of time. Foreign investors like monopoly situations because this way they have a captive market and thus they can force their clients to defray their development costs through overcharging. But, th
is can be seen as the cost of modernization and integration into regional and global telecoms alliances. Once competition is allowed, everyone (especially the clients) will reap the benefits of modern information highways.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 To my mind this thinking is flawed
. The direct and indirect damages incurred by monopolies are immeasurable. Monopolies must be dismantled - and the sooner, the better. The transfer of part of a monopoly from domestic to foreign hands does not alter its economically cancerous nature. Mono
p
olies are guilty of over or under optimal investments, of overcharging clients, of distorting the allocation of economic resources, of market rigging, corruption and other criminal activities, of providing poor service, of selecting the wrong technologies
.
 Only the threat of competition - actual and fierce - can change all that. Even so, long after competition is introduced, monopolies seem to continue to control their markets. British Telecom still controls 72% of its markets - despite more than a decade 
of competition.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 Despite these considerations - and due to rampant corruption and cronyism - the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Czech{\*\xmlclose} {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
Republic{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Hungary{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Yugoslavia-Serbia{\*\xmlclose}, 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Estonia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Latvia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}Russia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} chose this path. {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Bulgaria{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname 
City}}Romania{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} will follow them next year and it seems that {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Macedonia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 might follow suit, more out of lack of choice of alternatives - than out of careful selection of them.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 The other way is by selling shares to investors in the stock exchanges - local and foreign. {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Poland{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 has adopted this path after years of foot-ragging. It will sell shares of its carriers early next year. This, however, is not a 
solution available to small countries with an undeveloped stock exchange and low liquidity. To float the local PTT in the Macedonian Stock Exchange would be absurd. Even to attract domestic capital in sufficient quantity would be unthinkable.}{\rtlch 
\af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 Some countrie
s avoid privatization altogether. They regard the fix of privatization as a fad, or a passing craze (which, in its more extreme forms, it is). They declare the telecommunications sector to be a matter of national strategic importance (again, to a very lim
ited extent, it is). {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Slovakia{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} has introduced a law in 1995 to actively prohibit the privatization of its PTT.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 But experience disproves the Slovak stance. Admittedly, privatization does have its unpleasant side effects:\~ redundant workers 
are fired by the thousands and unemployment goes up, for instance. Another result, cutely felt by every potential voter, is the radical increase in the price of local phone calls which used to be subsidized by the outlandish charges imposed on internation
al calls. Once cross - subsidization ceases and more realistic pricing is introduced - prices shoot up.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 But the price of all other services drop as sharply and there is a dramatic improvement in the quality and speed of the services provided.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 The technological aspect is not to be sneered at, either.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 The current infrastructure is insufficient in all Central and East European countries. It is partly incompatible with European Union standards and networks. The existing backbones will, of course, still be used b
ut they will be gradually replaced by fibre optics and digital switchboards.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27\cf1 Technologies like cable TV and broadcasting networks, satellites and above all, wireless and GSM networks will serve to bridge the capacity and compatibility gaps and deficiencies
. They will also reduce the dependence of new market entrants on the infrastructure and services provided by local PTTs - and this is good news.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch \cf1

 Web, Tim Berners-Lee is promoting the "Semantic Web". The Internet hitherto is a repository of digital content. It has a rudimentary inventory system and very crude data location services. As a sad result, most of the content is invisible and inaccessibl
e
. Moreover, the Internet manipulates strings of symbols, not logical or semantic propositions. In other words, the Net compares values but does not know the meaning of the values it thus manipulates. It is unable to interpret strings, to infer new facts, 
t
o deduce, induce, derive, or otherwise comprehend what it is doing. In short, it does not understand language. Run an ambiguous term by any search engine and these shortcomings become painfully evident. This lack of understanding of the semantic foundatio
n
s of its raw material (data, information) prevent applications and databases from sharing resources and feeding each other. The Internet is discrete, not continuous. It resembles an archipelago, with users hopping from island to island in a frantic search
 for relevancy.
\par Even visionaries like Berners-Lee do not contemplate an "intelligent Web". They are simply proposing to let users, content creators,\~ and web developers assign descriptive meta-tags ("name of hotel") to fields, or to strings of symbols ("Hil
ton"). These meta-tags (arranged in semantic and relational "ontologies" - lists of metatags, their meanings and how they relate to each other) will be read by various applications and allow them to process the associated strings of symbols correctly (pla
c
e the word "Hilton" in your address book under "hotels"). This will make information retrieval more efficient and reliable and the information retrieved is bound to be more relevant and amenable to higher level processing (statistics, the development of h
e
uristic rules, etc.). The shift is from HTML (whose tags are concerned with visual appearances and content indexing) to languages such as the DARPA Agent Markup Language, OIL (Ontology Inference Layer or Ontology Interchange Language), or even XML (whose 
tags are concerned with content taxonomy, document structure, and semantics). This would bring the Internet closer to the classic library card catalogue.
\par Even in its current, pre-semantic, hyperlink-dependent, phase, the Internet brings to mind Richard Dawkins' seminal work "The Selfish Gene" (OUP, 1976). This would be doubly true for the Semantic Web.
\par Dawkins suggested to generalize the principle of natural selection to a law of the survival of the stable. "A stable thing
 is a collection of atoms which is permanent enough or common enough to deserve a name". He then proceeded to describe the emergence of "Replicators" - molecules which created copies of themselves. The Replicators that survived in the competition for scar
ce raw materials were characterized by high longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity. Replicators (now known as "genes") constructed "survival machines" (organisms) to shield them from the vagaries of an ever-harsher environment.
\par This is very reminiscent 
of the Internet. The "stable things" are HTML coded web pages. They are replicators - they create copies of themselves every time their "web address" (URL) is clicked. The HTML coding of a web page can be thought of as "genetic material". It contains all 
t
he information needed to reproduce the page. And, exactly as in nature, the higher the longevity, fecundity (measured in links to the web page from other web sites), and copying-fidelity of the HTML code - the higher its chances to survive (as a web page)
.
\par Replicator molecules (DNA) and replicator HTML have one thing in common - they are both packaged information. In the appropriate context (the right biochemical "soup" in the case of DNA, the right software application in the case of HTML code) - this info
rmation generates a "survival machine" (organism, or a web page). 
\par The Semantic Web will only increase the longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity or the underlying code (in this case, OIL or XML instead of HTML). By facilitating many more interactions 
with many other web pages and databases - the underlying "replicator" code will ensure the "survival" of "its" web page (=its survival machine). In this analogy, the web page's "DNA" (its OIL or XML code) contains "single genes" (semantic meta-tags). The 
whole process of life is the unfolding of a kind of Semantic Web.
\par In a prophetic paragraph, Dawkins described the Internet:
\par "The first thing to grasp about a modern replicator is that it is highly gregarious. A survival machine is a vehicle containing not j
ust one gene but many thousands. The manufacture of a body is a cooperative venture of such intricacy that it is almost impossible to disentangle the contribution of one gene from that of another. A given gene will have many different effects on quite dif
f
erent parts of the body. A given part of the body will be influenced by many genes and the effect of any one gene depends on interaction with many others...In terms of the analogy, any given page of the plans makes reference to many different parts of the
 building; and each page makes sense only in terms of cross-reference to numerous other pages"
\par What Dawkins neglected in his important work is the concept of the Network. People congregate in cities, mate, and reproduce, thus providing genes with new "survi
val machines". But Dawkins himself suggested that the new Replicator is the "meme" - an idea, belief, technique, technology, work of art, or bit of information. Memes use human brains as "survival machines" and they hop from brain to brain and across time
 
and space ("communications") in the process of cultural (as distinct from biological) evolution. The Internet is a latter day meme-hopping playground. But, more importantly, it is a Network. Genes move from one container to another through a linear, seria
l
, tedious process which involves prolonged periods of one on one gene shuffling ("sex") and gestation. Memes use networks. Their propagation is, therefore, parallel, fast, and all-pervasive. The Internet is a manifestation of the growing predominance of m
emes over genes. And the Semantic Web may be to the Internet what Artificial Intelligence is to classic computing. We may be on the threshold of a self-aware Web.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

h
at direction. How can technological regulation - as fast as it is - be humanlike? One (possible) solution(?) is the one I have developed in "Chaos AD", which is biased towards the big difference of the speed between the dissemination of financial and othe
r
 information and the much slower democratic proceedings. My idea (based upon the book "The Economy of Chaos" by Antonio Escohotado, 1999) was to reduce this unevenness by speeding democratic transmissions (elections, referenda, legal procedures) while, at
 the same time, reducing legal complications. But my idea seem to be just that, an idea(l). The problem remains because the law, of its very being, is slow (compared to the speed of light financial movements).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Ethics have been always related to slow motion. Does technology mean the death of morality (to use Nietzsche's terms:-). What kind of justice and laws can be appli
ed in such a fast tempo? There are great problems with official documents and digital formats.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
Another important feature of technology that has a direct relationship to the realm of the law is the cybernetic field (the pennant of this complex world is the book "Cybernetica" by Norbert Wiener), which has the revealing 
subtitle: "Control in Animals and Humans"). The ever increasing figures of mechanic, electronic and photo-technological controls belongs to "the sign of the times".}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 No amount of self-de
precation will suffice to hide the fact that you are an original thinker. One does not to be a lawyer to discuss the law, the way one has to be a quantum physicist to discuss string theory. The law has one thing in common with technology: it is all-pervas
ive, it permeates every minutest aspect of our existence, it is the embodiment of (social and economic) philosophies and it evolves constantly (though, as you say, less speedily than technology does).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Before I explore to your various points (probably in my next letter, not to render this one too long) - let me be the nitpicker and set up the framework for our intellectual Christmas adventure.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 One can discern the following relationships between the Law and Technology:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
1. Sometimes technology becomes an inseparable part of the law. In extreme cases, technology itself becomes the law. The use of polygraphs, faxes, telephones, video, audio and computers is an integral part of many laws - etched into them. It is not an art
i
ficial co-habitation: the technology is precisely defined in the law and forms a CONDITION within it. In other words: the very spirit and letter of the law is violated (the law is broken) if a certain technology is not employed or not put to correct use. 
T
hink about police laboratories, about the O.J. Simpson case, the importance of DNA prints in everything from determining fatherhood to exposing murderers. Think about the admissibility of polygraph tests in a few countries. Think about the polling of memb
e
rs of boards of directors by phone or fax (explicitly required by law in many countries). Think about assisted suicide by administering painkillers (medicines are by far the most sizeable technology in terms of money). Think about security screening by us
i
ng advances technology (retina imprints, voice recognition). In all these cases, the use of a specific, well defined, technology is not arbitrarily left to the judgement of law enforcement agents and courts. It is not a set of options, a menu to choose fr
om. It is an INTEGRAL, crucial part of the law and, in many instances, it IS the law itself.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 2. Technology itself contains embedded laws of all kinds. Consider internet protocols. These are laws which form part and parcel of the process of decentralized da
ta exchange so central to the internet. Even the language used by the technicians implies the legal origin of these protocols: "handshake", "negotiating", "protocol", "agreement" are all legal terms. Standards, protocols, behavioural codes - whether volun
t
arily adopted or not - are all form of Law. Thus, internet addresses are allocated by a central authority. Netiquette is enforced universally. Special chips and software prevent render certain content inaccessible. The scientific method (a codex) is part 
o
f every technological advance. Microchips incorporate in silicone agreements regarding standards. The law becomes a part of the technology and can be deduced simply by studying it in a process known as "reverse engineering". In stating this, I am making a
 distinction between lex naturalis and lex populi. All technologies obey the laws of nature - but we, in this discussion, I believe, wish to discuss only the laws of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Man.}{\rtlch 
\af0 \ltrch {\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 3. Technology spurs on the law, spawns it, as it were, gives it birth. The 
reverse process (technology invented to accommodate a law or to facilitate its implementation) is more rare. There are numerous examples. The invention of modern cryptography led to the formation of a host of governmental institutions and to the passing o
f
 numerous relevant laws. More recently, microchips which censor certain web content led to proposed legislation (to forcibly embed them in all computing appliances). Sophisticated eavesdropping, wiring and tapping technologies led to laws regulating these
 
activities. Distance learning is transforming the laws of accreditation of academic institutions. Air transport forced health authorities all over the world to revamp their quarantine and epidemiological policies (not to mention the laws related to air tr
avel and aviation). The list is interminable.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Once a law is enacted - which reflects the state of the art technology - the roles are reversed and the law gives a boost to technology. Seat belts and airbags were invented first. The law making seat belts (an
d, in some countries, airbags) mandatory came (much) later. But once the law was enacted, it fostered the formation of whole industries and technological improvements. The Law, it would seem, legitimizes technologies, transforms them into "mainstream" and
,
 thus, into legitimate and immediate concerns of capitalism and capitalists (big business). Again, the list is dizzying: antibiotics, rocket technology, the internet itself (first developed by the Pentagon), telecommunications, medical computerized scanni
ng - and numerous other technologies - came into real, widespread being following an interaction with the law. I am using the term "interaction" judiciously because there are four types of such encounters between technology and the law:}{\rtlch \af0

4. A Law that cannot be made known to the citizenry or that cannot be effectively enforced is a "dead letter" - not a law in the vitalist, dynamic sense of the word. For instance, 
the Laws of Hammurabi (his codex) are still available (through the internet) to all. Yet, do we consider them to be THE or even A Law? We do not and this is because Hammurabi's codex is both unknown to the citizenry and inapplicable. Hammurabi's Laws are

\fs27 Technology plays an indispensable role in both the dissemination of information and in enforcement efforts
. In other words, technology helps teach the citizens what are the laws and how are they likely to be applied (for instance, through the courts, their decisions and precedents). More importantly, technology enhances the efficacy of law enforcement and, th
u

 Laws of Man (mainly the former). The very structure and dynamics of technology are identical to the structure and dynamics of the law - because they are one and the same. The Law is abstract - technology is corporeal. This, to my mind, is absolutely the

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Fortunately recovered from my technological injuries (computer\'b4s malaise) and its blind laws and we can go on with our dialogue.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 By the way, I have to say that interactive work is one of the best achievements of technology. Your exposition of "the quasi-identity of law and technology" cleared a blind spot in my vision. I w
as so focused on the contradictions that I couldn't see the similarities. And so it is. This is evident in warfare, for instance, where each new weapon (the Huns' step and powder are great examples) induces new rules of war (where is the Clausewitz of the
 nuclear chessboard?!:-))).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Indeed, your comparison takes us to higher considerations. If we adopt some of your conclusions, we can assert, conversely, that the "new rulers" are the technicians (confirming F.G. J\'fc
nger's prognosis). For if technology is law
 then its technicians are the legislators. This, then, is a great change of even greater consequences. Let us remember that philosophers have been the legislators in later centuries (laws were founded on philosophical principles). Another question, that I
 will explore deeply in the next letters is: who is the technician and which are his thoughts?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Setting aside this strange hypothesis, lets us see what is actually happening. Whether they have a pessimistic approach or an optimistic one, it seems that think
ers agree on the fact that technology has been the buzzword of the century. An all-encompassing wave that permeates all, even thought. The whole surface of the earth has been covered with a technological mantle, and not only the earth but the universe, th
e cosmos, is being cloaked by machines.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 These machines and their technology abruptly altered the human atmosphere and its "tempo". The point of view is no longer human, or terrestrial but rather a cosmic one. Video technologies and real time interactions c
hange, as McLuhan brilliantly observed 30 years ago, not only traditional law but its (habitual? last 2500+ years?) enclosing frame: the alphabetic language. This is precisely what most thinkers and intellectuals fail to see - while continuing to debate o
l
d things within the old frame. To affirm the identity of law and technology is indeed to erase the law - the law as we know it, in the historical sense - to return to tribal (mythical) law. Apparently, there is a contradiction between the ever increasing 
c
omplexity of post-modern laws and this "tribalizing" effect but there is no discord between the two. The flow of language (hypertexts) means the flowing of the law - it reminds one of a pre-Socratic tribe studying "physis" in search of new myths to explai
n a constantly changing nature, to discover, with emotion and delight, forms, attractors emerging from that chaotic madness.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The distinctive mark of this law, the law of this great tribe, is the intensive use of images (and its numerical control and its pu
rified hyper-rational/scientific method: statistical mechanics). The avalanche of video technologies, filming methods, digital processing, all this "new imagery" can be summarized in what Nobert Wiener once said:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 "In {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Newton{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
's times automatism was a clock-machinery with music and rigid statuettes spinning up over the lid. In the XIXth century the automaton is the glorified steam motor, that burns combustible fuel instead the glycogen of human muscles. The contemporary automa
ton opens doors with photoelectric cells, points nuclear weapons or solves differential equations."}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This "wave of imagery" converts the law into a cybernetic process. It is also interesting to note, as I said in my previous letter, that "Cybernetics" (deri
ved from a greek word: kybernetes: "pilots", steersmen), which can be fairly considered as the beast's mother, has for its subtitle the sentence "Control and communication in the Animal and the Machine". These controls are based on the real-time evaluatio
n
 and comparison of photographic impressions, quanta of light (and information) measured by digital processes (mostly based on vision and less on sound and other sensa). It changes dramatically not only the traditional law but also the space such law works
 
in, and finally leads not only to a return of the acoustic, tribal word but also to something else: a new grammar that should be better called PHOTOGRAMMAR. The further consequences of this change are not yet observable, but for those of our readers which
 still possess a consciousness of higher spiritual and poetic orders I would like to note a relationship: the predominance of vision is the nature of predators and birds of prey.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 "Cybernetics" and the rest of Wiener's works provide us with the "original" d
ocuments (with the "Roseta Stone") of the new law of the new land. N. Wiener is without a doubt one of the most brilliant and powerful scientists and mathematicians of the XX century. Apart from his great contributions to mathematics, computing and other 
fields, the minor fact that he was deeply interested in Goethe\'b4s "The Wizard\'b4
s Apprentice" (and the answers he came up with) demonstrates the profundity of his thought. We are faced with a serious, first class, thinker. At the centre of Cybernetics is one, 
at first view, simple mechanism: the feedback loop. In fact, this mechanism was known as early as the XVIII century. {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Watts{\*\xmlclose}
' steam engine used a centrifugal regulator based on feedback. Also it has its roots in Hegel's and Fichte's (dialectic) thought 
and its refined version by the (hallucinatory) mathematical mind of C.S.Pierce. This mechanism is at the heart of all new systems of control and, by extension, of the new social organizations. It is what fashionable intellectuals (Giddens) call "reflexivi
ty" and others "government at distance" or "tele-government" - as per the consumer's taste:-)}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 On a prosaic level this means a new way (law) of organization, a life in constant movement, changing, reflecting, adapting to new situations always at increasing 
complexity. On a superior level, if we want to provide an exact and complete "figure", a grammatically well defined prototype, the cybernetic revolution means entering a magical space, much alike that of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Alice{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} in Wonderland were laws appear and disappear from fantasy.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Especially interesting (and fascinating and striking) are Wiener\'b4

Mankind is coming back a full circle - from ideograms through alphabet to ideograms. Consider computers. They started as pure alphabet beasts. I recall my programming days with ASSEMBLY, COBOL and PL/1 on a clunky IBM 360 and later, IBM 370. We used Holle

ccess to one's alphabet is possessing self-consciousness and intelligence (in the Turing sense). Don't misunderstand me: self-awareness and intelligence can be perfectly mediated through images. But access to an alphabet and to the RULES of its meaningful
 
manipulation is indispensable to survival, at least to the survival of intelligence. By "meaningful" I mean: generating a useful and immediately applicable representation of the world, of ourselves and of our knowledge about the world, ourselves and our i
n
teractions with the world. When no longer capable of generating such meaningful representations (because technology has hidden our alphabet - the RULES - from our sight) - that day, technology, philosophy and law-making will be one and the same and humans
 will have no place in such a world - at least, they will have no MEANINGFUL place in it.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 It is false that science generates technology - the reverse has always been true. All the big and important technological advances, the Promethean breakthroughs - wer
e achieved by ENGINEERS and technicians, not by scientists. Engineers manipulate the world - scientists manipulate rules, the laws of nature. What computers did is MERGE this two activities and make them indistinguishable. Writing a new software applicati
o
n is both composing rules and engaging in technology. This is because the substance upon which technological innovation is exercised is no longer MATERIAL. Both technology and laws deal with INFORMATION now. This is the convergence of the real and the abs
tract, the Platonic ideal and its inferior shadow, matter and energy. It is no less revolutionary than E=MC2.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 So, technology leads science. Both technology and science start with images. Kekula dreamt the structure of the Benzen molecule, Einstein envision
ed the geometry of space and so on. But, in the past, technology ended up generating objects - while science ended up generating rules and embedding them or expressing them in formalisms. The big revolution of the second half of this passing century is th
a
t now both science and cutting age technology produce the same: rules, formalisms, abstract entities. In other words: information and its manipulation - RULES - have become the main product of modern society. Some of the output is hard to classify as rule
s
. Is a television show a rule or a set of rules? The deconstructivists will say: definitely so and I will second that. a television show, a software application, a court procedure, a text - are all repositories and depositories of rules, thousands of them
: social rules, cultural rules, physical laws of nature, narratives and codes and myriad other guidelines.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This leads us to cybernetics.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 At first - during the 50s and 60s - an artificial distinction was drawn between cybernetic systems (such as biological
 ones) and programmable computers (or universal Turing machines). The former were considered limited by the rigidity of the repertoire of their responses to their feedback loops. Computers, on the other hand, were considered infinitely flexible by virtue 
o
f their programmability. This view was shattered by the unexpected enormous complexity of biological organisms and even automata. Gradually, cybernetics was subsumed under computing (rather, vice versa) and computers were considered to be a class of cyber
netic systems. I recommend to you to read "Cybernetics and the Philosophy of Mind" by Sayre published in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}London{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} in 1976).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 They all contain information stored, a set of rules to regulate behaviour and feedback loops. Yet, few people - if any - noti
ced how politically subversive this model was. If the "center's" behaviour is potentially profoundly alterable by feedback from the "periphery" - then centre and periphery become equipotent. More accurately, the very notions of centre and periphery disint
e
grate and are replaced by a decentralized, loosely interacting system of information processing and information storage "nodes". The Internet, to regurgitate the obvious, is an example of such a decentralized system. The simultaneous emergence of mathemat
ical theories (fractals, recursiveness) that de-emphasized centrality helped to give birth to the inevitably necessary formalism - the language of networks (neural, computers, social and other).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Decentralization removes the power of law-making from any par
ticular node in the system. Each node is a law unto itself. The system, as a whole, as long as it wishes to remain a system and continue to function as such, reaches a "legislative equilibrium". It is a Prigogine type thermodynamic trajectory: it is dynam
ic, unstable, ever-changing, fluctuating but, by and large, it is identity-preserving and it is functional. The new systems are systems of INFORMAL law as opposed to the older systems which are mainly and mostly systems of FORMAL law.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The clash between the
se two models was and is unavoidable. The internet, for instance, regulates itself imposing a set of unwritten rules vaguely called the "Netiquette". Part mores and part habits, it is amorphic and always debatable. Yet it functions much better than drug-r
e
lated laws in formal law systems (like modern states). With no effective enforcement mechanisms, no netiquette-enforcement agencies to speak of - the netiquette maintains an iron grip over netizens. There are other examples outside the internet: the self 
regulating financial industry in {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Britain{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} has a better record of compliance that the heavily regulated, SEC-threatened financial community in the 
{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}. Efforts top tax the Internet and to regulate the City are examples of turf wars between formal law systems and informal law systems.}{\rtlch \af0

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 But there is a price to pay and it is the ever growing fuzziness of our laws. The more complex the world, the more demanding the raw material, the more

Some will argue against this and say that robots need not be automata in the classical, Church-Turing, sense. That they could act according to heuristic, probabilistic rules of decision making. There are many other types of functions (non-recursive) that
 can be incorporated in a robot. True, but then, how can one guarantee full predictability of behaviour? How can one be certain that the robots will fully and always implement the three laws? Only recursive systems are predictable in principle (their comp
lexity makes even this sometimes not feasible).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 An immediate question springs to mind: HOW will a robot identify a human being? Surely, in an age of perfect androids, constructed of organic materials, no superficial, outer scanning will suffice. Structure 
and composition will not be sufficient factors of differentiation. There are two possibilities to settle this very practical issue: one is to endow the robot with the ability to conduct a Converse Turing Test, the other is to somehow "bar-code" all the ro
bots by implanting some signalling device inside them. Both present additional difficulties.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 In the second case, the robot will never be able to positively identify a human being. He will surely identify robots. This is ignoring, for discussion's sake, def
ects in manufacturing or loss of the implanted identification tag \endash 
 if the robot will get rid of the tag, presumably this will fall under the "defect in manufacturing" category. But the robot will be forced to make a binary selection: one type of physical entities will be classified as robots \endash 
 all the others will be grouped into "non-robots". Will non-robots include monkeys and parrots? Yes, unless the manufacturers equip the robots with digital or optical or molecular equivalent of the human image in vary
ing positions (standing, sitting, lying down). But this is a cumbersome solution and not a very effective one: there will always be the odd position which the robot will find hard to locate in its library. A human disk thrower or swimmer may easily be pas
sed over as "non-human" by a robot. So will certain types of amputated invalids.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The first solution is even more seriously flawed. It is possible to design a test which the robot will apply to distinguish a robot from a human. But it will have to be non-in
trusive and devoid of communication or with very limited communication. The alternative is a prolonged teletype session behind a curtain, after which the robot will issue its verdict: the respondent is a human or a robot. This is ridiculous. Moreover, the
 
application of such a test will make the robot human in most of the important respects. A human knows other humans for what they are because he is human. A robot will have to be human to recognize another, it takes one to know one, the saying (rightly) go
es.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Let us assume that by some miraculous way the problem will be overcome and robots will unfailingly identify humans. The next question 
pertains to the notion of "injury" (still in the First Law). Is it limited only to a physical injury (the disturbance of the physical continuity of human tissues or of the normal functioning of the human body)? Should it encompass the no less serious ment
a
l, verbal and social injuries (after all, they are all known to have physical side effects which are, at times, no less severe than direct physical "injuries"). Is an insult an injury? What about being grossly impolite, or psychologically abusing or torme
n
ting someone? Or offending religious sensitivities, being politically incorrect? The bulk of human (and, therefore, inhuman) actions actually offend a human being, has the potential to do so or seem to be doing so. Take surgery, driving a car, or investin
g all your money in the stock exchange \endash  they might end in coma, accident, or a stock exchange crash respectively. Should a robot refuse to obey human instructions which embody a potential to injure said instruction-givers? Take a mountain climber 
\endash  should 
a robot refuse to hand him his equipment lest he falls off the mountain in an unsuccessful bid to reach the peak? Should a robot abstain from obeying human commands pertaining to crossing busy roads or driving sports cars? Which level of risk should trigg
e
r the refusal program? In which stage of a collaboration should it be activated? Should a robot refuse to bring a stool to a person who intends to commit suicide by hanging himself (that's an easy one), should he ignore an instruction to push someone jump
 off a cliff (definitely), climb the cliff (less assuredly so), get to the cliff (maybe so), get to his car in order to drive to the cliff in case he is an invalid \endash  where does the responsibility and obeisance buck stop?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Whatever the answer, one thing is c
lear: such a robot must be equipped with more than a rudimentary sense of judgement, with the ability to appraise and analyse complex situations, to predict the future and to base his decisions on very fuzzy algorithms (no programmer can foresee all possi
ble circumstances). To me, this sounds much more dangerous than any recursive automaton which will NOT include the famous Three Laws.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Moreover, what, exactly, constitutes "inaction"? How can we set apart inaction from failed action or, worse, from an actio
n which failed by design, intentionally? If a human is in danger and the robot tried to save him and failed \endash  how will we be able to determine to what extent it exerted itself and did everything that it could do?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 How much of the responsibility for the inaction or partial action or failed action should be attributed to the manufacturer \endash 
 and how much imputed to the robot itself? When a robot decides finally to ignore its own programming \endash  how will we be informed of this momentous event? Outside appearances 
should hardly be expected to help us distinguish a rebellious robot from a lackadaisical one.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The situation gets much more complicated when we consider conflict states. Imagine that a robot has to hurt one human in order to prevent him from hurting anothe
r. The Laws are absolutely inadequate in this case. The robot should either establish an empirical hierarchy of injuries \endash 
 or an empirical hierarchy of humans. Should we, as humans, rely on robots or on their manufacturers (however wise and intelligent) to make this selection for us? Should abide by their judgement \endash 
 which injury is more serious than the other and warrants their intervention?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The authors confined themselves to dealing with computations which involved "effective" or "mechanical" methods for finding results (which could also be expressed as solutions (values) to formulae). These method
s were so called because they could, in principle, be performed by simple machines (or human-computers or human-calculators, to use Turing's unfortunate phrases). The emphasis was on finiteness: a finite number of instructions, a finite number of symbols 
i
n each instruction, a finite number of steps to the result. This is why these methods were usable by humans without the aid of an apparatus (with the exception of pencil and paper as memory aids). Moreover: no insight or ingenuity were allowed to "interfe
re" or to be part of the solution seeking process.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 What Church and Turing did was to construct a set of all the functions whose values could be obtained by applying effective or mechanical calculation methods. Turing went further down Church's road and des
igned the "Turing Machine" \endash 
 a machine which can calculate the values of all the functions whose values can be found using effective or mechanical methods. Thus, the program running the TM (=Turing Machine in the rest of this text) was really an effective 
or mechanical method. For the initiated readers: Church solved the decision-problem for propositional calculus and Turing proved that there is no solution to the decision problem relating to the predicate calculus. Put more simply, it is possible to "prov
e" the truth value (or the theorem status) of an expression in the propositional calculus \endash 
 but not in the predicate calculus. Later it was shown that many functions (even in number theory itself) were not recursive, meaning that they could not be solved by a Turing Machine.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
No one succeeded to prove that a function must be recursive in order to be effectively calculable. This is (as Post noted) a "working hypothesis" supported by overwhelming evidence. We don't know of any effectively calculable function w
hich is not recursive, by designing new TMs from existing ones we can obtain new effectively calculable functions from existing ones and TM computability stars in every attempt to understand effective calculability (or these attempts are reducible or equi
valent to TM computable functions).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Turing Machine itself, though abstract, has many "real world" features. It is a blueprint for a computing device with one "ideal" exception: its unbounded memory (the tape is infinite). Despite its hardware appearanc
e (a read/write head which scans a two-dimensional tape inscribed with ones and zeroes, etc.) \endash 
 it is really a software application, in today's terminology. It carries out instructions, reads and writes, counts and so on. It is an automaton designed to imp
lement an effective or mechanical method of solving functions (determining the truth value of propositions). If the transition from input to output is deterministic we have a classical automaton \endash  if it is determined by a table of probabilities 
\endash  we have a probabilistic automaton.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
With time and hype, the limitations of TMs were forgotten. No one can say that the Mind is a TM because no one can prove that it is engaged in solving only recursive functions. We can say that TMs can do whatever digital computers are doing \endash 
 but not that digital computers are TMs by definition. Maybe they are \endash  maybe they are not. We do not know enough about them and about their future.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Moreover, the demand that recursive functions be computable by an UNAIDED human seems to rest
rict possible equivalents. Inasmuch as computers emulate human computation (Turing did believe so when he helped construct the ACE, at the time the fastest computer in the world) \endash 
 they are TMs. Functions whose values are calculated by AIDED humans with th
e contribution of a computer are still recursive. It is when humans are aided by other kinds of instruments that we have a problem. If we use measuring devices to determine the values of a function it does not seem to conform to the definition of a recurs
i
ve function. So, we can generalize and say that functions whose values are calculated by an AIDED human could be recursive, depending on the apparatus used and on the lack of ingenuity or insight (the latter being, anyhow, a weak, non-rigorous requirement
 which cannot be formalized).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics which describes the microcosm. It is governed by the Schrodinger Equation (SE). This SE is an amalgamation of smaller equations, each with its own space coordinates as variables, each
 describing a separate physical system. The SE has numerous possible solutions, each pertaining to a possible state of the atom in question. These solutions are in the form of wave functions (which depend, again, on the coordinates of the systems and on t

eir associated energies). The wave function describes the probability of a particle (originally, the electron) to be inside a small volume of space defined by the aforementioned coordinates. This probability is proportional to the square of the wave funct
i
on. This is a way of saying: "we cannot really predict what will exactly happen to every single particle. However, we can foresee (with a great measure of accuracy) what will happen if to a large population of particles (where will they be found, for inst
ance)."}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This is where the first of two major difficulties arose:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 To determine what will happen in a specific experiment involving a specific particle and experimental setting \endash  an observation must be made. This means that, in the absence of an observing a
nd measuring human, flanked by all the necessary measurement instrumentation \endash 
 the outcome of the wave function cannot be settled. It just continues to evolve in time, describing a dizzyingly growing repertoire of options. Only a measurement (=the involvem
ent of a human or, at least, a measuring device which can be read by a human) reduces the wave function to a single solution, collapses it.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 A wave function is a function. Its REAL result (the selection in reality of one of its values) is determined by a h
uman, equipped with an apparatus. Is it recursive (TM computable and compatible)? In a way, it is. Its values can be effectively and mechanically computed. The value selected by measurement (thus terminating the propagation of the function and its evoluti
o
n in time by zeroing its the other terms, bar the one selected) is one of the values which can be determined by an effective-mechanical method. So, how should we treat the measurement? No interpretation of quantum mechanics gives us a satisfactory answer.
 It seems that a probabilistic automaton which will deal with semi recursive functions will tackle the wave function without any discernible difficulties \endash 
 but a new element must be introduced to account for the measurement and the resulting collapse. Perhaps a "boundary" or a "catastrophic" automaton will do the trick.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
The view that the quantum process is computable seems to be further supported by the mathematical techniques which were developed to deal with the application of the Schrodinger equation to a multi-electron system (atoms more complex than hydrogen and hel
i
um). The Hartree-Fok method assumes that electrons move independent of each other and of the nucleus. They are allowed to interact only through the average electrical field (which is the charge of the nucleus and the charge distribution of the other elect
rons). Each electron has its own wave function (known as: "orbital") \endash  which is a rendition of the Pauli Exclusion Principle.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The problem starts with the fact that the electric field is unknown. It depends on the charge distribution of the electrons which,
 in turn, can be learnt from the wave functions. But the solutions of the wave functions require a proper knowledge of the field itself!}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Thus, the SE is solved by successive approximations. First, a field is guessed, the wave functions are calculated, the
 charge distribution is derived and fed into the same equation in an ITERATIVE process to yield a better approximation of the field. This process is repeated until the final charge and the electrical field distribution agree with the input to the SE.}{
\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Recu
rsion and iteration are close cousins. The Hartree-Fok method demonstrates the recursive nature of the functions involved. We can say the SE is a partial differential equation which is solvable (asymptotically) by iterations which can be run on a computer
. Whatever computers can do \endash 
 TMs can do. Therefore, the Hartree-Fok method is effective and mechanical. There is no reason, in principle, why a Quantum Turing Machine could not be constructed to solve SEs or the resulting wave functions. Its special nature
 will set it apart from a classical TM: it will be a probabilistic automaton with catastrophic behaviour or very strong boundary conditions (akin, perhaps, to the mathematics of phase transitions).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Classical TMs (CTMs, Turing called them Logical Computing
 Machines) are macroscopic, Quantum TMs (QTMs) will be microscopic. Perhaps, while CTMs will deal exclusively with recursive functions (effective or mechanical methods of calculation) \endash 
 QTMs could deal with half-effective, semi-recursive, probabilistic, catastrophic and other methods of calculations (other types of functions).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The third level is the Universe itself, where all the functions have their values. From the point of view of the Universe (the equivalent of an infinite TM), all the functions are re
cursive, for all of them there are effective-mechanical methods of solution. The Universe is the domain or set of all the values of all the functions and its very existence guarantees that there are effective and mechanical methods to solve them all. No d
e
cision problem can exist on this scale (or all decision problems are positively solved). The Universe is made up only of proven, provable propositions and of theorems. This is a reminder of our finiteness and to say otherwise would, surely, be intellectua

 it, perhaps, the sound of a nest of white ants?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 \line Dear Roberto,}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 I fully share your view that both the Law and Technology (as I told you, I regard them as two manifestations of one and the same thing) - are concerned with the preservation and propagation of identity.}{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
The Law (religious and secular alike) is chiefly concerned with the protection of what IS, of the prevailing social and economic order, with the maintenance of social structure and of social function (or, at the least, of their appearance). Pu
t differently, the Law - a mechanism of social control - is designed mainly to preserve and conserve an ideal of structural immutability coupled with functional flexibility. As immutability and flexibility are contradictory traits - the Law embodies a gre
a
t tension between its dynamic aspects and its conservative ones. This tension is resolved by the introduction of the idea of identity. It is an abstraction put to good use by individuals as well as by nations and states. It is the belief that as long as a
n entity invariably succumbs to the same set of laws which dictate both its structure and its processes (the space of its permitted changes) - it is one and the same over time.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Thus the law is structurally static (aspires to maintain structures) and functi
onally dynamic (aspires to contain change and assimilate it with minimum alteration of the structure). Despite appearances to the contrary, these are the characteristic of technology and technological innovation. Technology aspires to restrain and tame ch
a
nge within recognizable structures. In other words, it, too, is interested in the dynamic preservation of identity by co-opting and "domesticating" change. This is typical of science as well, in my view. I do not agree with Kuhn's model of "paradigmatic" 
revolutions. I find Deutsch's model of scientific advance through the substitution of explanations within identity-preserving scientific processes to be much closer to reality.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 In this sense, the compact disc, for instance, is the structure maintained (car
ried over from the long play, vinyl record) as it incorporates changes: the quality of sound, the deciphering mechanism, the material from which the record is made. The internet is a vastly changed network, the likes of which existed before (for instance,
 the telegraph).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
You raise the important issue of incremental changes that somehow (through accumulation or epiphenomenally) accrue to a major change. But this is not the kind of change I am referring to. Few are the changes that disrupt identity to the ex
tent of replacing it by another. One should not mistake the FLUX of identities - emerging, submerging and merging - with a FUNDAMENTAL substitution of an identity by another.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Identities are DEFINITIONS and both the Law and technology are preoccupied by definitions (law) and language (technology).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Allow me to digress a little and talk about cats, chairs and death (isn't this fun? Don't be mad at me - in dialogues there is no LAW that says that we CANNOT or NOT ALLOWED TO digress).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The sentence "all cats a
re black" is evidently untrue even if only one cat in the whole universe were to be white. Thus, the property "being black" cannot form a part of the definition of a cat. The lesson to be learnt is that definitions must be universal. They must apply to al
l the members of a defined set (the set of "all cats" in our example).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Let us try to define a chair. In doing so we are trying to capture the essence of being a chair, its "chairness". It is chairness that is defined \endash  not this or that specific chair. We w
ant to be able to identify chairness whenever and wherever we come across it. But chairness cannot be captured without somehow tackling and including the uses of a chair \endash 
 what is it made for, what does it do or help to do. In other words, a definition mus
t include an operative part, a function. In many cases the function of the Definiendum (the term defined) constitutes its meaning. The function of a vinyl record is its meaning. It has no meaning outside its function. The Definiens (the expression supplyi
ng the definition) of a vinyl record both encompasses and consists of its function or use.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Yet, can a vinyl record be defined in vacuum, without incorporating the record player in the definiens? After all, a vinyl record is an object containing audio infor
mation decoded by a record player. Without the "record player" bit, the definiens becomes ambiguous. It can fit an audio cassette, or a compact disc. So, the context is essential. A good definition includes a context, which serves to alleviate ambiguity.}
{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Ostensibly, the more details provided in the definition \endash 
 the less ambiguous it becomes. But this is not true. Actually, the more details provided the more prone is the definition to be ambiguous. A definition must strive to be both minimal and aesthetic. 
In this sense it is much like a scientific theory. It talks about the match or the correlation between language and reality. Reality is parsimonious and to reflect it, definitions must be as parsimonious as it is.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Let us summarize the characteristics of a good definition and then apply them and try to define a few very mundane terms.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 First, a definition must reveal the meaning of the term or concept defined. By "meaning" I mean the independent and invariant meaning \endash  not the culturally dependent, narrativ
e derived, type. The invariant meaning has to do with a function, or a use. A term or a concept can have several uses or functions, even conflicting ones. But all of the uses and functions must be universally recognized. Think about Marijuana or tobacco. 
They have medical uses and recreational uses. These uses are expressly contradictory. But both are universally acknowledged, so both define the meaning of marijuana or tobacco and form a part of their definitions.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Let us try to construct the first, indisputable, functional, part of the definitions of a few terms.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 "Chair" \endash  Intended for sitting.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 "Table" \endash  Intended for laying things on its surface.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 It is only when we know the function or use of the definiendum that we can begin to look for it. The function/use FILTERS the world and narrows the set of candidates to the definiendum. A definition is a serie
s of superimposed language filters. Only the definendum can penetrate this line-up of filters. It is like a high-specificity membrane: only one term can slip in.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The next parameter to look for is the characteristics of the definiendum. In the case of phys
ical objects, we will be looking for physical characteristics, of course. Otherwise, we will be looking for more ephemeral traits.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 "Chair" \endash  Solid structure Intended for sitting.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 "Game" \endash  Mental or physical activity of one or more people (the players), which deals with the accomplishment of goals.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 "Window" \endash  Planar discontinuity in a solid surface, which allows to look through it, or for the penetration of light or air (when open or not covered).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
A contrast begins to emerge between a rigorous "dictionary-language-lexical definition" and a "stipulative definition" (explaining how the term is to be used). The first might not be immediately recognizable, the second may be inaccurate, non-universal or
 otherwise lacking.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
Every definition contrasts the general with the particular. The first part of the definiens is almost always the genus (the wider class to which the term belongs). It is only as we refine the definition that we introduce the differentia
 (the distinguishing features). A good definition allows for the substitution of the defined by its definition (a bit awkward if we are trying to define God, for instance, or love). This would be impossible without a union of the general and the particula
r
. A case could be made that the genus is more "lexical" while the differentia are more stipulative. But whatever the case, a definition must include a genus and a differentia because, as we said, it is bound to reflect reality and reality is hierarchical 
and inclusive ("The Matriushka Doll Principle").}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 "Chair" \endash  Solid structure Intended for sitting (genus). Makes use of at least one bodily axis of the sitter (differentia). Without the differentia \endash  with the genus alone \endash 
 the definition can well fit a bed or a divan.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 "Game" \endash 
 Mental or physical activity of one or more people (the players), which deals with the accomplishment of goals (genus), in which both the activities and the goals accomplished are reversible (differentia). Without the differentia \endash  with

 the definition can well fit the statue of a one-legged soldier holding a tray.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 It was Locke who realized that there are words whose meaning can be precisely explained but which cannot be DEFINED in this sense. This is either because the explanatory 
equivalent may require more than genus and differentia \endash 
 or because some words cannot be defined by means of others (because those other words also have to be defined and this leads to infinite regression). If we adopt the broad view that a definition is t
he explanation of meaning by other words, how can we define "blue"? Only by pointing out examples of blue. Thus, names of elementary ideas (colours, for instance) cannot be defined by words. They require an "ostensive definition" (definition by pointing o
u
t examples). This is because elementary concepts apply to our experiences (emotions, sensations, or impressions) and to sensa (sense data). These are usually words in a private language, our private language. How does one communicate (let alone define) th
e
 emotions one experiences during an epiphany? On the contrary: dictionary definitions suffer from gross inaccuracies precisely because they are confined to established meanings. They usually include in the definition things that they should have excluded,
 
exclude things that they should have included or get it altogether wrong. Stipulative or ostensive definitions cannot be wrong (by definition). They may conflict with the lexical (dictionary) definition and diverge from established meanings. This may prov
e
 to be both confusing and costly (for instance, in legal matters). But this has nothing to do with their accuracy or truthfulness. Additionally, both types of definition may be insufficiently explanatory. They may be circular, or obscure, leaving more tha
n one possibility open (ambiguous or equivocal).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Many of these problems are solved when we introduce context to the definition. Context has four conceptual pillars: time, place, cultural context and mental context (or mental characteristics). A definition,
 which is able to incorporate all four elements is monovalent, unequivocal, unambiguous, precise, universal, appropriately exclusive and inclusive, aesthetic and parsimonious.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
It is easy to notice that the distinction between the differentia and the context is rather blurred. Many of the differentia are the result of cultural and historical context. A lot of the context emerges from the critical mass of differentia.}{\rtlch 
\af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
We have confined our discussion hitherto to the structural elements of a definition. But a definition is a dynamic process. It involves the sentence doing the defining, the process of defining and the resulting defining expression (definiens).
 This interaction between different definitions of definition gives rise to numerous forms of equivalence, all called "definitions". Real definitions, nominal definitions, prescriptive, contextual, recursive, inductive, persuasive, impredicative, extensio
nal and intensional definitions, are stars in a galaxy of alternative modes of explanation.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 But it all boils down to the same truth: it is the type of definition chosen and the rigorousness with which we understand the meaning of "definition" that determin
e which words can and cannot be defined. In my view, there is still a mistaken belief that there are terms which can be defined without going outside a specified realm (=set of terms). People are trying to define life or love by resorting to chemical reac
t
ions. This reductionism inevitably and invariably leads to the Locke paradoxes. It is true that a definition must include all the necessary conditions to the definiendum. Chemical reactions are a necessary condition to life. But they are not sufficient co
nditions. A definition must include all the sufficient conditions as well.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Now we can try to define "definition" itself:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 In other words, an identity of the Dying (=it which "commits" Death) is essential in defining Death. But what are the means to establish an unambiguous, unequivocal identity?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Is an identity established through the use of quantitative parameters?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Is it dependent, for instance, upon the number of discrete units which comprise the functioning whole?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 If so, where is the level at which useful distinctions and observations are replaced by useless scholastic mind-warps?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Example: if we study a human identity - should it be defined by the number and organization of its limbs, its cells, its atoms?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The cells in a human body are replaced (with the exception of the cells of the nervous system) every 5 years. Would this imply that we gain a new identity each time this cycle is completed?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Adopting this course of thinking leads to absurd results:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
When humans die, the replacement rate of their cells is infinitely reduced. Does this mean that their identity is better and longer preserved once dead? No one would agree with this. Death is tantamount to a loss of identity - not to its preservation.}{
\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 So, a qualitative yardstick is required.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
We can start by asking will the identity change - if we change someone's' brain by another's? "He is not the same" - we say of someone with a brain injury. If a partial alteration of the brain causes such sea change (however partial) in the determinants o
f identity - it seems safe to assume that a replacement of one's brain by another will result in a total change of identity, to the point of its abolition and replacement by another.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 If the brain is the locus of identity, we should be able to assert that when (the cells of) all the other organs of the body are replaced (with the exception of the brain) - the identity will remain the same.}{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The human hardware (body) and software (the wiring of the brain) are conversely analogous to a computer.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 If we change all the software in a computer - it will still remain the same (though more or less capable) computer. This is equivalent to growing up in humans.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 However, if we change the computer's processor - it will no longer be identified as the same computer.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This
, partly, is the result of the separation between hardware (=the microprocessor) and software (=the programmes that it processes). There is no such separation in the human brain. These 1300 grams of yellowish material in our heads are both hardware and so
ftware.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
Still, the computer analogy seems to indicate that our identity resides not in our learning, knowledge, or memories. It is an epiphenomenon. It emerges when a certain level of hardware complexity is attained. Yet, it is not so simple. If we were to
 eliminate someone's entire store of learning and memories (without affecting his brain) - would he still be the same person (=would he still retain the same identity)? Probably not.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Luckily, achieving the above - erasing one's learning and memories witho
ut affecting his brain - is impossible. In humans, learning and memories ARE the brain. They change the hardware that processes them in an irreversible manner.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This, naturally, cannot be said of a computer. There, the separation is clear. Change a computer's hardware and you changed its identity. And computers are software - invariant.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 We are, therefore, able to confidently conclude that the brain is the sole determinant of identity, its seat and signifier. This is because our brain IS both our processing
 hardware and our processing software. It is also a repository of processed data. ANY subsystem comprising these functions can be justly equated with the system of which it is a part. This seems to hold true even under the wildest gedanken experiments.}{
\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 A human brain detached from any body is still assumed to possess identity. And a monkey implanted with a human brain will host the identity of the former owner of the brain.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Around this seemingly faultless test revolved many of the debates which characterized the first decade of the new discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Turing's Test pits invisible (hardware - less) intelligences (=brains) against one another. The answers which they provide (by teleprinter, hidden behind partitions) determine thei
r identity (human or not). When the software (=the answers) is accessible, no direct observation of the hardware (=the brains) is necessary in order to determine identity. But the brain's status as THE privileged identity system is such that even if no an
swers are forthcoming from it - the identity will reside with it.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 For instance, if for some logistical or technological problem, a brain will be prevented from providing output, answers, and interactions - we are likely to assume that it has the potential 
to do so. Thus, in the case of an inactive brain, an identity will be the derivative of its potential to interact (rather than of its actual interaction).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 After all, this, exactly, is what paleoanthropologists are attempting to do. They are trying to deli
neate the identity of our forefathers by studying their skulls and, by inference, their brains and their mental potentials. True, they invest effort in researching other types of bones. Ultimately, they hope to be able to draw an accurate visual descripti
on of our ancestors. But we must not confuse description with identity, phenomenology with aetiology. What dies, therefore, is the brain and only the brain.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Functionally, Death can also be defined (really, observed) from the outside. It is the cessation of
 the exertion of influence (=power) over physical systems. It is sudden absence of physical effects exerted by the dead object, a singularity, a discontinuity. It is not an inert state of things.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Inertia is a balance of forces - and in Death the absence o
f any force whatsoever is postulated. Death is, therefore, also not an entropic climax. Entropy is an isotropic, homogeneous distribution of energy. Death is the absence of any and all energies. While, outwardly, the two might seem identical - they are th
e two poles of a dichotomy.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
So, Death, as opposed to inertia or entropy, is not something that modern physics is fully equipped to deal with. Physics, by definition, deals with forces and measurable effects. It has nothing to say about force-less, energy-d
evoid physical states. Actually, this would be a stark contradiction in its terms.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Indeed, this definition of Death has reality itself to argue against it.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 If Death is the cessation of impacts on physical systems (=the absence of physical effects), we are hard pressed to explain memory away.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Memory is a physical effect (=electrochemical activity of the brain) within a physical system (=the Brain). It can be preserved and shipped across time and space in capsules called books or articles (or art). These c
ontainers of triggers of physical effects (in recipient brains) defy Death. The physical system which produced the memory capsule will surely cease to exist - but it will continue to physically impact other physical systems long after its demise, long aft
er it was supposed to have ceased to do so.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Memory divorces Death from the physical world. As long as we (or our products) are remembered - we continue to have a physical effect on future physical systems. And as long as this happens - we are not technical
ly (or, at least, fully) dead. Our Death will be fully accomplished only after our memory will have been wiped out completely, not even having the potential of being reconstructed in the future. Only then will we cease to have any dimension of existence (
=effect on other physical systems).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Philosophically, there is no difference between being influenced by a direct discussion with Kant - and being influenced by his words preserved in a time-space capsule (=a book). For the listener/reader Kant is very much
 alive, more alive than many of his neighbours whom he never met.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This issue can be further radicalized. What is the difference between a two dimensional representation of Kant (portrait), a three dimensional representation of the philosopher (a statute) 
and yet another three dimensional representation of him (Kant himself as perceived by his contemporaries who chanced to see him)?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 As far as a bias-free observer is concerned (a camera linked to a computer) - there is no difference. All these representatio
ns are registered and mathematically represented in a processing unit so as to allow for a functional, relatively isomorphic mapping. Still, human observes will endow the three dimensional versions with a privileged status.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Philosophically, there is no rigorous reason to do so.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
It is conceivable that, in the future, we will be able to preserve a three-dimensional likeness (a hologram), replete with smells, temperature and tactile effects. Why should the flesh and blood version be judged superior to such a likeness?}{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
Physically, the choice of a different medium does not create a hierarchy of representations, from better to worse. In other words, the futuristic hologram should not be deemed inferior to the classic, organic version as long as they both posses
s the same information content.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Thus, the hierarchy cannot be derived from describing the state of things.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 An
 hierarchy is established by considering potentials, namely: the future. Non-organic representations (hereinunder referred to as "representations") of intelligent and conscious organic originals (hereinunder referred to as ; "organic originals") are finit
e. The organic originals are infinite in their possibilities to create and to procreate, to change themselves and their environment, to act and be acted upon within ever more complex feedback loops.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The non-organic versions, the representations, are self c
ontained and final. The organic originals and their representations may contain identical information in a given nano-second. But the amount of information will increase in the organic version and decrease in the non-organic one (due to the second Law of 
Thermodynamics). This inevitable divergence is what endows the organic original with its privileged status.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This property - of increasing the amount of information (=order) through creation and procreation - characterizes not only the organic originals but
 also anything that emanates from them. It characterizes human works of art and science, for instance, or the very memory of humans. All these tend to increase information (indeed, they are, in themselves, information packets).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 So, could we happily sum an
d say that the propagation and the continuation of physical effects (through memory) is the continuation of Life after Death? Life and Memory share an important trait. They both have a negentropic (=order and information increasing) impact on their surrou
ndings. Does that make them synonymous? Is Death only a transitory phase from one form of Life (organic) to another (informational, spiritual)?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 However tempting this equation is - in most likelihood, it is also false.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The reason is that there are two sour
ces of the increase in information and what sets them apart is not trivial. As long as the organic original lives, all creation depends upon it. After it dies, the works that it has created and the memories that are associated with it, continue to affect 
physical systems.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
However, their ability to foster new creative work, new memories, in short: their capacity to increase order through increased information is totally dependent upon other, living, organic originals. In the absence of all other organic ori
ginals, they will stagnate and go through an entropic decrease of information and order.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 So, this is the crux of the distinction between Life and Death:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 LIFE is the potential, possessed by organic originals, to create (=to fight entropy by increasing inf
ormation and order), using their own software. Such software can be coded into hardware - e.g., the DNA - and then the creative act involves the replication of the organic original or parts thereof.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Upon the original's
 DEATH, the potential to create is propagated through Memory. Creative acts, works of art and science, other creations can be carried out only within the software (=the brains) of other, living, organic originals.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Both forms of creation can co-exist durin
g the original's life. Death, however, is proclaimed only with the incapacitation of the first form of creation (by an organic original independent of others), only when the surrogate form of creation becomes exclusive.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Memories created by one organic ori
ginal resonate through the brains of others. This generates information and provokes the creative potential in recipient brains. Some of them do react by creating and, thus, play host to the parasitic, invading memory, infecting other members of the memor
y-space (=the cultural space).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Death is, therefore, the assimilation of the products of an organic original in a Collective. It is, indeed, the continuation of Life but in a collective, rather than in an individualistic mode.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Alternatively, Death could be
 defined as a terminal change in the state of the hardware with designated pieces of the software injected to the brains of the Collective. This, of course, is reminiscent of certain viral mechanisms. The comparison may be superficial and misleading - or 
may open a new vista: the individual as a cell in the large organism of humanity. Memory has a role in this new form of socio-political evolution which superseded Biological Evolution, as an instrument of adaptation.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Certain human reactions - e.g., opposition to change and religious and ideological wars - can perhaps be viewed as immunological reactions in this context.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 I hope I made my point clear and that you can see the forest from the (too many) woods. Both the Law and Technology deal with identities and definitions - in other words, both are manipulations of language.}{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 We have come a full circle. I opened by saying that technology is the embodiment of valid statements - such as protocols (language) in the physical realm. The Law is a series of such val
id statements and, in many respects, Technology feeds the Law and embodies Laws in its hardware and software.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Now, if you still wish to get practical - I am all eyes ...:o))}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Sam}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 \line Hi Sam,}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 I must say that your "apparent" disgressions on linguistic proble
ms and concerning life-after-death are no disgression at all but very pertinent questions (all my analyses are, in fact, based solely upon life and death). These two are, in my opinion, the only pair of words that remain clear. Indeed, your disgression on
 
linguistics provides us with a beautiful example of the contradictions and tensions implied in the couplet "identity and velocity". It would seem that the Law (as does Art) has its own rules of "tempo" and "weight". Indeed, your digression offers a great 
example of what I call "the inclined enclosing frame", that is to say, all is in motion, even the frame of mind. This is not yet a revolution, however great, this is a change, a metamorphosis.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Regarding your comments on life-after-death I should say that, 
in spite of your suggestive presentation, they are nothing new. The First world War marked a red line in history fostering a new figure: the anonymous soldier, the cell in the organism, the wheel in the machine . No other form of life-after-death was wish
ed (and considered) by the old Celtic races: sons (propagation of genetic material). In fact, what other life-after-death more real than a son? Those evolutionary ideas! Does anybody still think\~
 it is a risk that they have appeared recently? As far as I kn
ow Nietzsche was the first who cast the problem in real terms. By the way, I must say that it was Nietzsche himself who thought about life-after-death in your terms and even went far beyond by asking himself, with his habitual poetic genius: "Wouldn't Lif
e
 be just a strange kind of Death?". Anyway, Nietzsche stumbled on spurious Darwinism as most thinkers, even today, do, but he thought (erroneously?) that there was a truth hidden in Darwinism: a drive to continuous perfection and thus, to supermanhood. Ig
noring Nietzsche\'b4
s "Rennaisance-like hysteria of power" and, over all his "sins", his titanic deviation, it seems that sometimes, depeneding on his turbulent style and his protean fogs, he brings an investigation to light, a choleric prophecy, a question of
 destiny: what does it mean to us, the self-appointed pinnacle of nature, its more powerful tool, this "ever-present" drive to perfection?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 To put it in your terms, which trait is common, if any, to IDENTITY and SURPASSING? If we translate such ideas to ou
r century (which, by the way, was considered by Nietzsche as his proper home) a question arises: are we tempted, with our technolgical advances (genetics and artificial intelligence) into achieving supermanhood in its more spurious, materialistic, vulgar 
and titanical ways?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 But, in spite of these metaphysicaI depths, I still wish to be practical:-)}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 As the only real subject of the law of Life and Death, my writing is always focused on the individual. Humanity, society, seems to be only cast in History (of 
the past). To start with, it must be said that there is no longer the old "in versus out" (internal versus external) problem (the individual against nature, the state, or culture). As I have pointed out, in a certain way, you, too, live on an inclined pla
n
e. It is not only the world which, at an ever increasing "molto vivace" tempo, is changing and threatening us - but also it is our conceptions of world which are changing. From a birds' eye view, all these characteristics: fuzziness, extreme movement, eve
r
 faster tempo, the hunger for energy, are the signs of metamorphosis. Finally, the individual himself has to put a face to the dilemma, the "to be or not to be"? Is he with man or with superman? Are we transforming ourselves into information (the modern v
ersion of what the ancients called the soul, the spirit)? Is the age of information our supermanhood: the Supermind?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Then, how will the techno-future be related to the individual, which poisons and pleasures, which treats and fights are there for him? The 
individual should know, in the first place, that his position is, more than ever, ad hoc.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The First Premise: THERE IS NO EXIT. The technological organization is total. It covers the Earth completely - the environment is now auxiliary. He should also know 
that the new selection principle is technological, the arena is in n-dimensional spaces, the weapons are mathematics. The old knowledge of nature (and its possibilities) must be accompanied by technological knowledge (for instance, a full knowledge of tec
hno-pharmacology). Technology admits all the old myths and probably new possibilities: masks, guerrilla warfare, etc... all are there for the individual.\~
 And it poses new dangers: totalitarianism is le must of these dangers. The domination of technology works with sweeping controls. The use of the mask seems almost essential to survival (the mask of mediocrity is the best).\~
 New changes in the selection principle are always possible, the spiritual man must be fully aware of the extension and velocity of the
 tech-waves. The arena is a magic space, changing abruptly. To survive, the mind of the spiritual man should be like that of a Tai-chi fighter's: open to all the possibilities, just like water (the spirit of Zen), a universal action from a universal point
 
of view. Always ready to fight, always ready to play; extremely relaxed and extremely fixed. Technology feeds on the four elements, only the fifth, Eros, is out of its dominion. Sexual love, friendship and the muses are the only true riches. Whenever we e
njoy these pleasures, we are out of the power of the technological Leviathan. There are no morals yet, only models. Stoicism, hedonism and all the other pre-Socratic concepts are always helpful tools (the two ages have some things in common).}{\rtlch 
\af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 A study of other cultures is\~
 essential (a full, real-time adaptation to any place and any time). "Umheilicht" must be overcome with two movements of extreme tension: a deep study in history (natural, universal, human, religious, philosophical, etc.) and the diary obse
rvation of the technological breaking point (what the old historians called: the "short time" and the "long time"). To combine these two fields is the mark of the cultivated future man. As Goethe beautifully stated: our feet firmly on earth (reality), our
 minds always connected to the stars. That is our destiny and also our pleasure.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 These are nothing more than incomplete advices. The total field is changing all the time. Fully settled in traditional knowledge,
 the spiritual man should always be attuned to the last movement, ever changing his mind without changing his heart. The (re-)creation of new myths is the superlative "work" bestowed upon the unique person. "Life is UNCONDITIONAL, death is only the beginn
ing."}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Well, thats all for now. In my next letter, I'll talk about the king: the technician and his politics. It is essential for the unique person to know who and how rules. Your turn.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Best regards\line roberto}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 \line Dear Roberto,}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Indeed, we are almost in full agreement (does this begin to worry you? ...;o))}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 I also think that the age of information will see the revolutionizing of the very process of evolution, its speed, its ends, its means, its distribution (all-pervasiveness). I am not sure that we have a choic
e (between Man and Superman, for instance). I think the phase transition will occur when a new principle of selection is introduced, as you have suggested. It will be a principle of selection between competing models of civilization. In this, its nature w
i
ll be no different to its predecessors. But it will employ different criteria. For the first time, technology per se, as DISTINCT from humanity - will have a say. From now on - and ever more so in the future - we are TWO equal partners: the Man and the Ma
chine. The increasing complexity of the latter will render it intelligent and the equal of Man himself.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Actually, what you are talking about in your letter is a kulturkampf, a clash or battle of cultures. I tend to doubt this specific outcome - I think tra
nsition will be smoother and that disparate cultures will COHABITATE - though I fully agree with all your premises. Here is why:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Culture is a hot topic. Scholars (Fukoyama, Huntington, to mention but two) disagree about whether this is the end of history or the beginning of a particularly nasty chapter of it.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 What makes cultures tick and why some of them tick discernibly better than others \endash  is the main bone of contention.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 We can view cultures through the prism of their attitude towards their constituent
s: the individuals they are comprised of. More so, we can classify them in accordance with their approach towards "humanness", the experience of being human.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Some cultures are evidently anthropocentric \endash  others are anthropo-transcendental. These two lingual coins need elaboration to be fully}{\rtlch \ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \i\fs27  }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
comprehended.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 A culture which cherishes the human potential and strives to create the conditions needed for its fullest materialization and manifestation is an anthropocentric culture. Such striving is the top priorit
y, the crowning achievement, the measuring rod of such a culture, its attainment - its criterion of success or failure.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 On the other pole of the dichotomy we find cultures which look beyond humanity. This "transcendental" look has multiple purposes.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Some cultures want to transcend human limitations, others to derive meaning, yet others to maintain social equilibrium. But what is common}{\rtlch \ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \i\fs27  }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
to all of them \endash  regardless of purpose \endash  is the subjugation of human endeavour, of human experience, human potential, all things human to this transcendence.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Granted: cultures resemble living organisms. They evolve, they develop, they procreate. None of them was "created" the way it is today. Cultures go through Differential Phases \endash 
 wherein they re-define and re-invent themselves using varied parameters. Once these phases are over \endash 
 the results are enshrined during the Inertial Phases. The Differential Phases are period of social dislocation and upheaval, of critical, even revolutionary thinking, of new technologies, new me
thods of achieving set social goals, identity crises, imitation and differentiation.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \ab\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\fs27 Distinguishing versus Consuming Cultures}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
Some cultures give weight and presence (though not necessarily equal) to each of their constituent elements (the individual and social structures). Each such element is idiosyncratic and unique. Such cultures would accentuate attention to details,
 private enterprise, initiative, innovation, entrepreneurship, inventiveness, youth, status symbols, consumption, money, creativity, art, science and technology.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 These are the things that distinguish one individual from another.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Other cultures engulf their constituents, assimilate them to the point of consumption. They are deemed, a priori, to be redundant, their worth a function of their actual contribution to the whole.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Such cultures emphasize generalizations, stereotypes, conformity, consensus, belonging, social structures, procedures, forms, undertakings involving the labour or other input of human masses.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \ab\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\fs27 Future versus Past Oriented Cultures}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Some cultures look to the past \endash  real or imaginary \endash  for inspiration, mot
ivation, sustenance, hope, guidance and direction. These cultures tend to direct their efforts and resources and invest them in what IS. They are, therefore, bound to be materialistic, figurative, substantive, earthly.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 They are likely to prefer old age to
 youth, old habits to new, old buildings to modern architecture, etc. This preference of the Elders (a term of veneration) over the Youngsters (a denigrating term) typifies them strongly. These cultures are likely to be risk averse.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Other cultures look to the future \endash  always projected \endash  for the same reasons.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 These cultures invest their efforts and resources in an ephemeral future (upon the nature or image of which there is no agreement or certainty).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 These cultures are, inevitably, more abstract (living 
in an eternal Gedankenexperiment), more imaginative, more creative (having to design multiple scenarios just to survive). They are also more likely to have a youth cult: to prefer the young, the new, the revolutionary, the fresh \endash 
 to the old, the habitual, the predictable. They are be risk-centered and risk-assuming cultures.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \ab\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\fs27 Consensus versus Conflictual Cultures}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Some cultures are more cohesive, coherent, rigid and well-bounded and constrained. As a result, they 
will maintain an unchanging nature and be static. They discourage anything which could unbalance them or perturb their equilibrium and homeostasis. These cultures encourage consensus-building, teamwork, togetherness and we-ness, mass experiences, social s
a
nctions and social regulation, structured socialization, peer loyalty, belonging, homogeneity, identity formation through allegiance to a group. These cultures employ numerous self-preservation mechanisms and strict hierarchy, obedience, discipline, discr
imination (by sex, by race, above all, by age and familial affiliation).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Other cultures seem more "ruffled", "arbitrary", or disturbed. They are pluralistic, heterogeneous and torn. These are the dynamic (or, fashionably, the emergent) cultures. They encou
rage conflict as the main arbiter in the social and economic spheres ("the invisible hand of the market" or the American "checks and balances"), contractual and transactional relationships, partisanship, utilitarianism, heterogeneity, self fulfilment, flu
idity of the social structures, democracy.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \ab\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\fs27 Exogenic-Extrinsic Meaning Cultures versus Endogenic-Intrinsic Meaning Cultures}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Some cultures derive their sense of meaning, of direction and of the resulting wish-fulfillment by referring to frameworks which are
 outside them or bigger than them. They derive meaning only through incorporation or reference.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The encompassing framework could be God, History, the Nation, a Calling or a Mission, a larger Social Structure, a Doctrine, an Ideology, or a Value or Belief System, an Enemy, a Friend, the Future \endash 
 anything qualifies which is bigger and outside the meaning-seeking culture.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Other cultures derive their sense of meaning, of direction and of the resulting wish fulfilment by referring to themselves \endash  and to themselves only. It is not that these cultures ignore the past \endash 
 they just do not re-live it. It is not that they do not possess a Values or a Belief System or even an ideology \endash  it is that they are open to the possibility of altering it.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 While in the first type of cultures, Man is meaningless were it not for the outside systems which endow him with meaning \endash 
 In the latter the outside systems are meaningless were it not for Man who endows them with meaning.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \ab\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\fs27 Virtually Revolutionary Cultures versus Structurally-Paradigmatically Revolutionary Cultures}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 All cultures \endash  no matter how inert and conservative \endash  evolve through the differential phases.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 These phases are transitory and, therefore, revolutionary in nature.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Still, there are two types of revolution:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Virtual Revolution is a change (sometimes, radical) of the structure \endash  while the content is mostly preserved. It is very much like changing the hardware without changing any of the software in a computer.}{
\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The other kind of revolution is more profound. It usually involves the transformation or metamorphosis of both structure and content. In other cases, the structures remain intact \endash 
 but they are hollowed out, their previous content replaced by new one. This is a change of paradigm (superbly described by the late Thomas Kuhn in his masterpiece: "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions").}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \ab\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\fs27 The Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome Differentiating Factor}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 As a result of all the above, cultures react with shock either to change or to its absence.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 A taxonomy of cultures can be established along these lines:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 It seems that the Neurotic cultures are less adapted to win the battle to survive. The fittest are those cultures flexible enough to respond to an ever changing world \endash 
 and at an ever increasing pace, at that. The neurotic cultures are slow to respond, rigid and convulsive. Being past-orientated means that they emulate and imitate the normal cultures \endash 
 but only when they have become part of the past. Alternatively, they assimilate and adopt some of the attributes of the past of normal cultures. This is why 
a traveller who visits a neurotic culture (and is coming from a normal one) often has the feeling that he has been thrust to the past, that he is experiencing a time travel.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 A War of Cultures is, therefore, not very plausible. The neurotic cultures need the normal cultures. The latter are the generators of the former's future. A normal culture's past is a neurotic culture's future.}{\rtlch 
\af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Deep inside, the neurotic cultures know that something is wrong with them, that they are ill-adapted. That is why members of these cultural spheres entertain overt emotions of envy, hostility even hatred \endash 
 coupled with explicit sensations of inferiority, inadequacy, disappointment, disillusionment and despair. The eruptive nature (the neurotic rage) of these cultures is exactly 
the result of these inner turmoils. On the other hand, soliloquy is not action, often it is a substitute to it. Very few neurotic cultures are suicidal \endash  and then for very brief periods of time.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 To forgo the benefits of learning from the experience of nor
mal cultures how to survive would be suicidal, indeed. This is why I think that the transition to a different model, replete with different morals, will be completed with success. But it will not eliminate all pervious models - I foresee cohabitation.}{

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 But, I think we are not dealing with the same question. I am presenting this question in absolute terms. Though all those considerations about cultures are interesting indeed, it is not my intention at all to come with\~
 another page of the "futurology of technology" or to try to make a new version of techno-waves, futures shocks and versions of culture wars of Toffler's, Huntington's and a
ll the rest (E. J. said enough in 1931). Concerning this special issue I will elaborate in my next letter, again with pragmatic intentions. I will try to give the reader a brief picture of the king: the technician. It is essential for the individual to kn
ow who is the ruler and how he rules.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 But I wasn't talking about that when I referred to Nietzsche. My question was not about cultures, nations, techno-waves, races or any other profiles. My interrogation was about the human species as a whole, those stran
ge things we called humans. I don't know what SURPASSING, OVERCOMING, mean de facto. I was just asking the readers (and myself): What does it mean, if we accept the hypothesis (and this is another question) of supermanhood?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Could be a significant change i
n the human species? I am thinking in "surpassing" humans with genetic engineering, the creation of not only new races but whole new species. That is my central idea in this dialogue: What if technology embodies the Law of Nature, and the Law of nature is
 
an eternal drive to perfection? Doesn't it mean that man must, de facto, be overcome? Does anybody think yet, that a superior species (if this means anything at all) would live with us in pax and harmony? Finally, I will ask you again: can humans be surpa
ssed? What does it mean, philosophically and existentially, OVERCOMING?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Sometimes, I am so obsessed with WHAT I have to say - that I forget to explain WHY I say it.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 I fully understood your questions the first time around. The confluence of genetic engineering, c
omputer networking (communal neural networks), telecommunications (especially wireless) and mass transport is bound to alter humanity profoundly and irreversibly. One possibility is, indeed, surpassing and overcoming on the way to the emergence of a Super
man, in the Nietzschean sense (whatever that is). Whether this is the inevitable result - is debatable. But it is a possibility which merits discussion.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch  
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 I prefer to be less metaphysical. I think that a new CULTURE will emerge. Cultures are highly structure
d reactive patterns adopted by human communities in response to shocks (including positive shocks), traumas, or drastic changes in circumstances. Cultures to human communities are very much as personalities are to individuals. I think the new technologies
 will spawn a host of new cultures (or, more like it, a global new culture).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

Only a small minority of humanity will be thus effected. Only the citizens of the rich, developed world are likely to have access to gen
etic engineering and computing and telecommunications on a pervasive scale. The "new species" is likely to be an isolated phenomenon, confined to niches of the Earth. The "new culture" will be a Rich Man's culture. This is what I meant by cohabitation. Ev

and violent. He was not interested in art, the spirit, self-control... but in his death toys. After the "necessary" destruction of the old world, he donned his new clothes: the overall, the uniform of the Worker, to build his own world (that he had a drea
m
t of). But the old directors were stupid, they did not see the new world, they were blind and weak, he had to liquidate them. Like the Pied Piper he walked all over the world, playing his electrifying symphony of work and vengeance. All, young and old ali
k

b
oy, who looked fascinated by his map and his time-clocks and pushed the buttons of his switchboard. When the tempest ended, he was the director of the factory. But, now he needed money,, so he went with his machines to Eldorado(TM), he invented RiskGames 
(
TM) to win in the roulette of the Casino of the Isle(R). Now he was the the director of Starve, Mooty and Poors(TM) and wore Armani(TM). But his thirst was infinite, he wanted all the prize. He wanted girls: the Romans ravished the Sabines(TM). He became 
a
n artist, clad in leather, he started a heavy-metal band called The Garage(TM). It was then that he discovered TV, so he contracted a band from Seattle(TM) and invented the grunge. He was now the director of a EFE(TM) (Entertainment For Ever), the megacor

 even one of horoscopes, it was called Acuarium(TM) TV and the TV spot went: "we sell future 24 hours a day, only 5$ per hour". Now he had alr
eady discovered the most cruel and sublime pleasure: to control other people's minds. So he bought the various parts of AT&T and made the world over a Net of titanium and silicon - satellites were marked with his trademarked name. Then, he created a new c

mpany of software games with the best techno-artists he found. He also bought the biggest chemical/genetic corporation: SupremArtis(TM). Finally he merged all them up and created the Ultimate Super-Megacorp, which sold mega-consoles whose games were more

A decade after the invention of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee is promoting the "Semantic Web". The Internet hitherto is a repository of digital content. It has a rudimentary inventory system a
nd very crude data location services. As a sad result, most of the content is invisible and inaccessible. Moreover, the Internet manipulates strings of symbols, not logical or semantic propositions. In other words, the Net compares values but does not kno
w
 the meaning of the values it thus manipulates. It is unable to interpret strings, to infer new facts, to deduce, induce, derive, or otherwise comprehend what it is doing. In short, it does not understand language. Run an ambiguous term by any search engi
n
e and these shortcomings become painfully evident. This lack of understanding of the semantic foundations of its raw material (data, information) prevent applications and databases from sharing resources and feeding each other. The Internet is discrete, n
ot continuous. It resembles an archipelago, with users hopping from island to island in a frantic search for relevancy.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Even visionaries like Berners-Lee do not contemplate an "intelligent Web". They are simply proposing to let users, content creators,\~ and
 web developers assign descriptive meta-tags ("name of hotel") to fields, or to strings of symbols ("Hilton"). These meta-tags (arranged in semantic and relational "ontologies" - lists of metatags, their meanings and how they relate to each other) will be
 
read by various applications and allow them to process the associated strings of symbols correctly (place the word "Hilton" in your address book under "hotels"). This will make information retrieval more efficient and reliable and the information retrieve
d
 is bound to be more relevant and amenable to higher level processing (statistics, the development of heuristic rules, etc.). The shift is from HTML (whose tags are concerned with visual appearances and content indexing) to languages such as the DARPA Age
n
t Markup Language, OIL (Ontology Inference Layer or Ontology Interchange Language), or even XML (whose tags are concerned with content taxonomy, document structure, and semantics). This would bring the Internet closer to the classic library card catalogue
.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Even in its current, pre-semantic, hyperlink-dependent, phase, the Internet brings to mind Richard Dawkins' seminal work "The Selfish Gene" (OUP, 1976). This would be doubly true for the Semantic Web.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Dawkins suggested to generalize the principle of natur
al selection to a law of the survival of the stable. "A stable thing is a collection of atoms which is permanent enough or common enough to deserve a name". He then proceeded to describe the emergence of "Replicators" - molecules which created copies of t
h
emselves. The Replicators that survived in the competition for scarce raw materials were characterized by high longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity. Replicators (now known as "genes") constructed "survival machines" (organisms) to shield them from t
he vagaries of an ever-harsher environment.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This is very reminiscent of the Internet. The "stable things" are HTML coded web pages. They are replicators - they create copies of themselves every time their "web address" (URL) is clicked. The HTML coding of a
 web page can be thought of as "genetic material". It contains all the information needed to reproduce the page. And, exactly as in nature, the higher the longevity, fecundity (measured in links to the web page from other web sites), and copying-fidelity 
of the HTML code - the higher its chances to survive (as a web page).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Replicator molecules (DNA) and replicator HTML have one thing in common - they are both packaged information. In the appropriate context (the right biochemical "soup" in the case of DNA, 
the right software application in the case of HTML code) - this information generates a "survival machine" (organism, or a web page).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Semantic Web will only increase the longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity or the underlying code (in this case, O
IL or XML instead of HTML). By facilitating many more interactions with many other web pages and databases - the underlying "replicator" code will ensure the "survival" of "its" web page (=its survival machine). In this analogy, the web page's "DNA" (its 
OIL or XML code) contains "single genes" (semantic meta-tags). The whole process of life is the unfolding of a kind of Semantic Web.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 In a prophetic paragraph, Dawkins described the Internet:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 "The first thing to grasp about a modern replicator is that it is 
highly gregarious. A survival machine is a vehicle containing not just one gene but many thousands. The manufacture of a body is a cooperative venture of such intricacy that it is almost impossible to disentangle the contribution of one gene from that of 
a
nother. A given gene will have many different effects on quite different parts of the body. A given part of the body will be influenced by many genes and the effect of any one gene depends on interaction with many others...In terms of the analogy, any giv
en page of the plans makes reference to many different parts of the building; and each page makes sense only in terms of cross-reference to numerous other pages."}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 What Dawkins neglected in his important work is the concept of the Network. People congregate 
in cities, mate, and reproduce, thus providing genes with new "survival machines". But Dawkins himself suggested that the new Replicator is the "meme" - an idea, belief, technique, technology, work of art, or bit of information. Memes use human brains as 
"
survival machines" and they hop from brain to brain and across time and space ("communications") in the process of cultural (as distinct from biological) evolution. The Internet is a latter day meme-hopping playground. But, more importantly, it is a Netwo
r
k. Genes move from one container to another through a linear, serial, tedious process which involves prolonged periods of one on one gene shuffling ("sex") and gestation. Memes use networks. Their propagation is, therefore, parallel, fast, and all-pervasi
ve. The Internet is a manifestation of the growing predominance of memes over genes. And the Semantic Web may be to the Internet what Artificial Intelligence is to classic computing. We may be on the threshold of a self-aware Web.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The computer screen, because of physical limitations (size, the fact that it has to be scrolled) fails to effectively compete with the 
printed page. The latter is still the most ingenious medium yet invented for the storage and release of textual information. Granted: a computer screen is better at highlighting discrete units of information. So, these differing capacities draw the battle
 lines: structures (printed pages) versus units (screen), the continuous and easily reversible (print) versus the discrete (screen).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The solution lies in finding an efficient way to translate computer screens to printed matter. It is hard to believe, but no
 such thing exists. Computer screens are still hostile to off-line printing. In other words: if a user copies information from the Internet to his word processor (or vice versa, for that matter) - he ends up with a fragmented, garbage-filled and non-aesth
etic document.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 CD-ROMs are probably a doomed medium. Storage capacity continually increases
 exponentially and, within a year, desktops with 80 Gb hard disks will be a common sight. Moreover, the much heralded Network Computer - the stripped down version of the personal computer - will put at the disposal of the average user terabytes in storage
 
capacity and the processing power of a supercomputer. What separates computer users from this utopia is the communication bandwidth. With the introduction of radio and satellite broadband services, DSL and ADSL, cable modems coupled with advanced compress
ion standards - video (on demand), audio and data will be available speedily and plentifully.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The CD-ROM, on the other hand, is not mobile. It requires installation and the utilization of sophisticated hardware and software. This is no user friendly push te
chnology. It is nerd-oriented. As a result, CD-ROMs are not an immediate medium. There is a long time lapse between the moment of purchase and the moment the user accesses the data. Compare this to a book or a magazine. Data in these oldest of media is in
stantly available to the user and they allow for easy and accurate "back" and "forward" functions.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Perhaps the biggest mistake of CD-ROM manufacturers has been their inability to offer an integrated hardware and software package. CD-ROMs are not compact. A 
Walkman is a compact hardware-cum-software package. It is easily transportable, it is thin, it contains numerous, user-friendly, sophisticated functions, it provides immediate access to data. So does the discman, or the MP3-man, or the new generation of e
-
books (e.g., E-Ink's). This cannot be said about the CD-ROM. By tying its future to the obsolete concept of stand-alone, expensive, inefficient and technologically unreliable personal computers - CD-ROMs have sentenced themselves to oblivion (with the pos
sible exception of reference material).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

 is likely to shed light on the future of the Net itself. The Net - exactly like the nervous system - provides pathways for the transport of goods and services - but also of memes and information, their processing, modeling, and integration.}{\rtlch \af0

 not in the eyes). Desktops will receive results and communicate with the Net to receive additional clarifications and instructions and to convey information gathered from their environment (mostly, from the user).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Put differently:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 In future, servers will 
contain not only information (as they do today) - but also software applications. The user of an application will not be forced to buy it. He will not be driven into hardware-related expenditures to accommodate the ever growing size of applications. He wi
l
l not find himself wasting his scarce memory and computing resources on passive storage. Instead, he will use a browser to call a central computer. This computer will contain the needed software, broken to its elements (=applets, small applications). Anyt
i

t
ing with his own software (the question of ownership will be very blurred). This technology is available and it provoked a heated debated about the future shape of the computing industry as a whole (desktops - really power packs - or network computers, a 
little more than dumb terminals). Access to online applications are already offered to corporate users by ASPs (Application Service Providers).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 In the last few years, scientists have harnessed the combined power of online PC's to perform astounding feats of
 distributed parallel processing. Millions of PCs connected to the net co-process signals from outer space, meteorological data, and solve complex equations. This is a prime example of a collective brain in action.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

LANs (Local Area Networks) are no longer a rarity in corporate offices. WANs (wide Area Networks) are used to connect geographically dispersed organs of the same legal entity (branches of a bank, daughter companies of a conglomerate
, a sales force). Many LANs and WANs are going wireless.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The wireless intranet/extranet and LANs are the wave of the future. They will gradually eliminate their fixed line counterparts. The Internet offers equal, platform-independent, location-independent 
and time of day - independent access to corporate memory and nervous system. Sophisticated firewall security applications protect the privacy and confidentiality of the intranet from all but the most determined and savvy crackers.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Intranet is an inter-organizational communication network, constructed on the platform of the Internet and it, therefore, enjoys all its advantages. The extranet is open to clients and suppliers as well.}{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The company's server can be accessed by anyone authorized, from anywhere,
 at any time (with local - rather than international - communication costs). The user can leave messages (internal e-mail or v-mail), access information - proprietary or public - from it, and participate in "virtual teamwork" (see next chapter).}{\rtlch 
\af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The develo
pment of measures to safeguard server routed inter-organizational communication (firewalls) is the solution to one of two obstacles to the institutionalization of Intranets. The second problem is the limited bandwidth which does not permit the efficient t
ransfer of audio (not to mention video).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 It is difficult to conduct video conferencing through the Internet. Even the voices of discussants who use internet phones (IP telephony) come out (though very slightly) distorted.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 All this did not prevent 95% of the
 Fortune 1000 from installing intranet. 82% of the rest intend to install one by the end of this year. Medium to big size American firms have 50-100 intranet terminals per every internet one.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 One of the greatest advantages of the intranet is the ability to transfer documents between the various parts of an organization. Consider Visa: it pushed 2 million documents per day internally in 1996.}{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 An organization equipped with an intranet can (while protected by firewalls) give its clients or suppliers access to

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Internet (its e-mail function) is eroding traditional mail. 90% of customers with on-line access use e-mail from time to time and 60% work with it regularly. More than 2 billion messages traverse the internet daily.}{
\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 E-mail applications are available as freeware and are included in all browsers. Thus, the Intern
et has completely assimilated what used to be a separate service, to the extent that many people make the mistake of thinking that e-mail is a feature of the Internet.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The internet will do to phone calls what it has done to mail. Already there are applicat
ions (Intel's, Vocaltec's, Net2Phone) which enable the user to conduct a phone conversation through his computer. The voice quality has improved. The discussants can cut into each others words, argue and listen to tonal nuances. Today, the parties (two or
 
more) engaging in the conversation must possess the same software and the same (computer) hardware. In the very near future, computer-to-regular phone applications will eliminate this requirement. And, again, simultaneous multi-modality: the user can talk
 over the phone, see his party, send e-mail, receive messages and transfer documents - without obstructing the flow of the conversation.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The cost of transferring voice will become so negligible that free voice traffic is conceivable in 3-5 years. Data traffic will overtake voice traffic by a wide margin.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The next phase will probably involve virtual reality. Each of the parties will be represented by an "avatar", a 3-D figurine generated by the application (or the user's likeness mapped and superimposed on th

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Internet allows for simultaneous communication and the efficient transfer of multimedia (video included) files between an unlimited number of users. This opens up a vista of mind boggling opportu
nities which are the real core of the Internet revolution: the virtual collaborative ("Follow the Sun") modes.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Examples:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 A group of musicians is able to compose music or play it - while spatially and temporally separated;}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Cinema and TV films are produced from disparate geographical spots through the teamwork of people who never meet, except through the Net.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 These examples illustrate the con
cept of the "virtual community". Space and time will no longer hinder team collaboration, be it scientific, artistic, cultural, or an ad hoc arrangement for the provision of a service (a virtual law firm, or accounting office, or a virtual consultancy net
work). The intranet can also be thought of as a "virtual organization", or a "virtual business".}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The virtual mall and the virtual catalogue are prime examples of spatial and temporal liberation.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 In 1998, there were well over 300 active virtual malls on the Internet. In 2000, they were frequented by 46 million shoppers, who shopped in them for goods and services.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The virtual mall is an Internet "space" (pages) wherein "shops" are located. These shops offer their wares using visual, audio and textual means. Th
e visitor passes through a virtual "gate" or storefront and examines the merchandise on offer, until he reaches a buying decision. Then he engages in a feedback process: he pays (with a credit card), buys the product, and waits for it to arrive by mail (o
r downloads it).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
The manufacturers of digital products (intellectual property such as e-books or software) have begun selling their merchandise on-line, as file downloads. Yet, slow communications speeds, competing file formats and reader standards, and lim
ited bandwidth - constrain the growth potential of this mode of sale. Once resolved - intellectual property will be sold directly from the Net, on-line. Until such time, the mediation of the Post Office is still required. As long as this is the state of t
he art, the virtual mall is nothing but a glorified computerized mail catalogue or Buying Channel, the only difference being the exceptionally varied inventory.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This contr

t
heir own - digitally generated - catalogue. This is updated daily: the variety of wares on offer (adjusted to reflect inventory levels, consumer preferences, and goods in transit) - and prices (sales, discounts, package deals) change in real time. Amazon 
h
as incorporated many of these features on its web site. The user enters its web site and there delineates his consumption profile and his preferences. A customized catalogue is immediately generated for him including specific recommendations. The history 
of his purchases, preferences and responses to feedback questionnaires is accumulated in a database. This intellectual property may well be Amazon's main asset.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 There is no technological obstacles to implementing this vision today - only administrative and 
legal (patent) ones. Big brick and mortar retail stores are not up to processing the flood of data expected to result. They also remain highly sceptical regarding the feasibility of the new medium. And privacy issues prevent data mining or the effective c
ollection and usage of personal data (remember the case of Amazon's "Readers' Circles").}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The virtual catalogue is a private case of a new internet off-shoot: the "smart (shopping) agents". These are AI applications with "long memories".}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

d
 by his GPS enabled wireless mobile or PDA. This technology can be seen in action in a few music sites on the web and is likely to be dominant with wireless internet appliances. The owner of an internet enabled (third generation) mobile phone is likely to
 be the target of geographically-specific marketing campaigns, ads and special offers pertaining to his current location (as reported by his GPS - satellite Geographic Positioning System).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 But this real estate bubble was the culmination of a long and tortuous process.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 At the beginning, only members of the fringes and the avant-garde (inventors, risk assuming entrepreneurs, gamblers) invest in a new invention. No one knows to say what are the optimal uses of the invention (in o
ther words, what is its future). Many - mostly members of the scientific and business elites - argue that there is no real need for the invention and that it substitutes a new and untried way for old and tried modes of doing the same things (so why assume
 the risk of investing in the unknown and the untried?).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Moreover, these criticisms are usually well-founded.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 To start with, there is, indeed, no need for the new medium. A new medium invents itself - and the need for it. It also generates its own market to satisfy this newly found need.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Two prime examples of this self-recursive process are the personal computer and the compact disc.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 When the PC was invented, its uses were completely unclear. Its
 performance was lacking, its abilities limited, it was unbearably user unfriendly. It suffered from faulty design, was absent any user comfort and ease of use and required considerable professional knowledge to operate. The worst part was that this knowl
edge was exclusive to the new invention (not portable). It reduced labour mobility and limited one's professional horizons. There were many gripes among workers assigned to tame the new beast. Managers regarded it at best as a nuisance.}{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The PC was thought o
f, at the beginning, as a sophisticated gaming machine, an electronic baby-sitter. It included a keyboard, so it was thought of in terms of a glorified typewriter or spreadsheet. It was used mainly as a word processor (and the outlay justified solely on t
h
ese grounds). The spreadsheet was the first real PC application and it demonstrated the advantages inherent to this new machine (mainly flexibility and speed). Still, it was more of the same. A speedier sliding ruler. After all, said the unconvinced, what
 was the difference between this and a hand held calculator (some of them already had computing, memory and programming features)?}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The PC was recognized as a medium only 30 years after it was invented with the introduction of multimedia software. All this t
ime, the computer continued to spin off markets and secondary markets, needs and professional specialties. The talk as always was centred on how to improve on }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 existing}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
 markets and solutions.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Internet is the computer's first important application. Hithe
rto the computer was only quantitatively different to other computing or gaming devices. Multimedia and the Internet have made it qualitatively superior, sui generis, unique.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Part of the problem was that the Internet was invented, is maintained and is oper
ated by computer professionals. For decades these people have been conditioned to think in Olympic terms: faster, stronger, higher - not in terms of the new, the unprecedented, or the non-existent. Engineers are trained to improve - seldom to invent. With
 few exceptions, its creators stumbled across the Internet - it invented itself despite them.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Computer professionals (hardware and software experts alike) - are linear thinkers. The Internet is non linear and modular.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 It is still the age of hackers. There i
s still a lot to be done in improving technological prowess and powers. But their control of the contents is waning and they are being gradually replaced by communicators, creative people, advertising executives, psychologists, venture capitalists, and th
e totally unpredictable masses who flock to flaunt their home pages and graphomania.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 These all are attuned to the user, his mental needs and his information and entertainment preferences.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The compact disc is a different tale. It was intentionally invented to improve upon an existing technology (basically, {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Edison{\*\xmlclose}\rquote 
s Gramophone). Market-wise, this was a major gamble. The improvement was, at first, debatable (many said that the sound quality of the first generation of compact discs was inferior to that of i
ts contemporaneous record players). Consumers had to be convinced to change both software and hardware and to dish out thousands of dollars just to listen to what the manufacturers claimed was more a authentically reproduced sound. A better argument was t
he longer life of the software (though when contrasted with the limited life expectancy of the consumer, some of the first sales pitches sounded absolutely morbid).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The computer suffered from unclear positioning. The compact disc was very clear as to its main functions - but had a rough time convincing the consumers that it was needed.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Every medium is first controlled by the technical people. Gutenberg was a printer - not a publisher. Yet, he is the world's most famous publisher. The technical cadre is joine
d by dubious or small-scale entrepreneurs and, together, they establish ventures with no clear vision, market-oriented thinking, or orderly plan of action. The legislator is also dumbfounded and does not grasp what is happening - thus, there is no legisla
t
ion to regulate the use of the medium. Witness the initial confusion concerning copyrighted vs. licenced software, e-books, and the copyrights of ROM embedded software. Abuse or under-utilization of resources grow. The sale of radio frequencies to the fir
st cellular phone operators in the West - a situation which repeats itself in Eastern and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Central Europe{\*\xmlclose} nowadays - is an example.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 But then more complex transactions - exactly as in real estate in "real life" - begin to emerge. The Internet is likely t
o converge with "real life". It is likely to be dominated by brick and mortar entities which are likely to import their business methods and management. As its eccentric past (the dot.com boom and the dot.bomb bust) recedes - a sustainable and profitable 
future awaits it.

onomics, it was stated by him thus: "You can see the computer age everywhere these days, except in the productivity statistics". The venerable economic magazine, "The Economist" in its issue dated {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}July 24th, 1999
{\*\xmlclose} quotes the no less venerable Professor Robert Gordon ("one of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}America{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}'s leading authorities on productivity") - p.20:}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 "...the productivity performance of the manufacturing sector of the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}United States{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose} economy since 1995 has been abysmal ra

in 1995-9 compared to 1972-95, but productivity growth in durable manufacturing stripped of computers has }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 decelerated even more."}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 What should be held true - the hype or the dismal statistics? The answer to this question is of crucial importance to economies in transition. If investment in IT (information technology) actually }{\rtlch 
\ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 RETARDS}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27  growth - then it should be avoided, at least until a functioning marketplace is in place to counter its growth suppressing effects.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The notion that IT retards growth is counter-intuitive. It would seem that, at the very least, computers allow us to do more of the same things only faster. Typing, order processing, inventory m
anagement, production processes, number crunching are all tackled more efficiently by computers. Added efficiency should translate into enhanced productivity. Put simply, the same number of people can do more, faster, and more cheaply with computers than 
without them. Yet reality begs to differ.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Two elements are often neglected in considering the beneficial effects of IT.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 First, the concept of information technology comprises two very distinct economic entities: an all-purpose machine (the PC) plus its enab
ling applications and a medium (the internet). Capital assets are distinct from media assets and are governed by different economic principles. Thus, they should be managed and deployed differently.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Massive, double digit increases in productivity are feasi
ble in the manufacturing of computer hardware. The inevitable outcome is an exponential explosion in computing and networking power. The dual rules which govern IT - {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Moore
{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}'s (a doubling of chip capacity and computing prowess every 18 months) and M

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 But for this increased productivity to trickle down to the rest of the economy a few conditions have to be met.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The
 transition from old technologies rendered obsolete by computing to new ones must not involve too much "creative destruction". The costs of getting rid of old hardware, software, of altering management techniques or adopting new ones, of shedding redundan
t
 manpower, of searching for new employees to replace the unqualified or unqualifiable, of installing new hardware, software and of training new people in all levels of the corporation are enormous. They must never exceed the added benefits of the newly in
troduced technology in the long run. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Hence the crux of the debate. Is IT more expensive to introduce, run and maintain than the technologies that it so confidently aims to replace? Will new technologies emerge in a pace sufficient to compensate for the dis
appearance of old ones? As the technology matures, will it overcome its childhood maladies (lack of operational reliability, bad design, non-specificity, immaturity of the first generation of computer users, absence of user friendliness and so on)?}{
\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Moreove
r, is IT an evolution or a veritable revolution? Does it merely allow us to do more of the same only differently - or does it open up hitherto unheard of vistas for human imagination, entrepreneurship, and creativity? The signals are mixed. }{\rtlch \af0 
\ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Hitherto, IT did not succeed to do to human endeavour what electricity, the internal combustion engine or even the telegraph have done. It is also not clear at all that IT is a }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 
UNIVERSAL}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27  phenomenon suitable to all business climes and mentalities. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The penetration of bot
h IT and the medium it gave rise to (the internet) is not globally uniform even when adjusting for purchasing power and even among the corporate class. Developing countries should take all this into consideration. Their economies may be too obsolete and h
idebound, poor and badly managed to absorb yet another critical change in the form of an IT shock wave. The introduction of IT into an ill-prepared market or corporation can be and often is counter-productive and growth-retarding.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 In hindsight, 20 years hen
ce, we might come to understand that computers improved our capacity to do things differently and more productively. But one thing is fast becoming clear. The added benefits of IT are highly sensitive to and dependent upon historical, psychosocial and eco
n
omic parameters outside the perimeter of the technology itself. When it is introduced, how it is introduced, for which purposes is it put to use and even by whom it is introduced. These largely determine the costs of its introduction and, therefore, its f
easibility and contribution to the enhancement of productivity. Developing countries better take note.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 Historical Note - The Evolutionary Cycle of New Media}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Internet is cast by its proponents as the great white hope of many a developing and poor country. It is, therefore, instructive to try to predict its future and describe the phases of its possible evolution.}{\rtlch 
\af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The internet runs on computers but it is rel
ated to them in the same way that a TV show is related to a TV set. To bundle to two, as it is done today, obscures the true picture and can often be very misleading. For instance: it is close to impossible to measure productivity in the services sector, 
let alone is something as wildly informal and dynamic as the internet. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Moreover, different countries and regions are caught in different parts of the cycle. Central and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Eastern Europe{\*\xmlclose} have just entered it while northern {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1
{\factoidname City}}Europe{\*\xmlclose}, some parts of {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}Asia{\*\xmlclose}, and {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}North America{\*\xmlclose} are in the vanguard. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 So, what should developing and poor countries expect to happen to the internet globally and, later, within their own territories? The issue here cannot be cast in terms of productivity. It is better to ap
ply to it the imagery of the business cycle.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 It is clear by now that the internet is a medium and, as such, is subject to the evolutionary cycle of its predecessors. Every medium of communications goes through the same evolutionary cycle. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The internet is 
simply the latest in a series of networks which revolutionized our lives. A century before the internet, the telegraph and the telephone have been similarly heralded as "global" and transforming. The power grid and railways were also greeted with universa
l enthusiasm and acclaim. But no other network resembled the Internet more than radio (and, later, television).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Every new medium starts with }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 Anarchy - }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 or }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 The Public Phase}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 .}{\rtlch 
\af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 At this stage, the medium and the resources attached to it are very cheap, accessible
, and under no or little regulatory constraint. The public sector steps in: higher education institutions, religious institutions, government, not for profit organizations, non governmental organizations (NGOs), trade unions, etc. Bedeviled by limited fin
ancial resources, they regard the new medium as a cost effective way of disseminating their messages.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Internet was not exempt from this phase which is at its death throes. It was born into utter anarchy in the form of ad hoc computer networks, local net
works, and networks spun by organizations (mainly universities and organs of the government such as DARPA, a part of the defence establishment in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
). }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Non commercial entities jumped on the bandwagon and started sewing and patching 
these computer networks together (an activity fully subsidized with government funds). The result was a globe-spanning web of academic institutions. The American Pentagon stepped in and established the network of all networks, the ARPANET. Other governmen
t departments joined the fray, headed by the National Science Foundation (NSF) which withdrew only lately from the Internet.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The Internet (with a different name) became public property - but with access granted only to a select few.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Radio took precisely this course. Radio transmissions started in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 in 1920. Those were anarchic broadcasts with no discernible regularity. Non commercial organizations and not for profit organizations began their own broadcasts and even created radio broa
dcasting infrastructure (albeit of the cheap and local kind) dedicated to their audiences. Trade unions, certain educational institutions and religious groups commenced "public radio" broadcasts.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The anarchic phase is followed by a }{\rtlch \ab\ai\af0\afs27 \ltrch \b\i\fs27 commercial}{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27  one.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 When the
 users (e.g., listeners in the case of the radio, or owners of PCs and modems in the realm of the Internet) reach a critical mass - businesses become interested. In the name of capitalist ideology (another religion, really) they demand "privatization" of 
the medium. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 
In its attempt to take over the new medium, Big Business pull at the heartstrings of modern freemarketry. Deregulating and commercializing the medium would encourage the efficient allocation of resources, the inevitable outcome of untrammeled c
ompetition; they would keep in check corruption and inefficiency, naturally associated with the public sector ("Other People\rquote 
s Money" - OPM); they would thwart the ulterior motives of the political class; and they would introduce variety and cater to the t
astes and interests of diverse audiences. In short, private enterprise in control of the new medium means more affluence and more democracy.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 The end result is the same: the private sector takes over the medium from "below" (makes offers to the owners or op
erators of the medium that they cannot possibly refuse) - or from "above" (successful lobbying in the corridors of power leads to the legislated privatization of the medium).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Every privatization - especially that of a medium - provokes public opposition. T
here are (usually founded) suspicions that the interests of the public were compromised and sacrificed on the altar of commercialization and rating. Fears of monopolization and cartelization of the medium are evoked - and proven correct, in the long run. 
Otherwise, the concentration of control of the medium in a few hands is criticized. All these things do happen - but the pace is so slow that the initial apprehension is forgotten and public attention reverts to fresher issues.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Again, consider the precedent of the public airwaves.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 A new Communications Act was legislated in the {\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}{\*\xmlopen\xmlns1{\factoidname City}}USA{\*\xmlclose}{\*\xmlclose}
 in 1934. It was meant to transform radio frequencies into a national resource to be sold to the private sector which will use it to 
transmit radio signals to receivers. In other words: the radio was passed on to private and commercial hands. Public radio was doomed to be marginalized.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

Phone companies were allowed to transmit video and cable companies were allowed to transmit telephony, for instance. This is all phased over a long period of time - still, it is a revolution whose magnitude is difficult to gauge and whos
e consequences defy imagination. It carries an equally momentous price tag - official censorship. }{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 Merely "voluntary censorship", to be sure and coupled with toothless standardization and enforcement authorities - still, a censorship with its own instituti

It is characterized by enhanced legislation. Legislators, on all levels, discover the medium and lurch at it passionately. Resources which were considered "free", suddenly are transformed to "national treasures not to be dispensed with cheaply, casual

It is conceivable that certain parts of the Internet will be "nationalized" (for instance, in the form of a licensing requirement) and tendered to the private sector. Legislation may be enacted which will deal with permitted and dis
allowed content (obscenity? incitement? racial or gender bias?).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

 (or elsewhere) has eschewed such legislation. There are sure to be demands to allocate time (or space, or software, or content, or hardware, or bandwid
th) to "minorities", to "public affairs", to "community business". This is a tax that the business sector will have to pay to fend off the eager legislator and his nuisance value.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 All this is bound to lead to a monopolization of hosts and servers. The impo
rtant broadcast channels will diminish in number and be subjected to severe content restrictions. Sites which will not succumb to these requirements - will be deleted or neutralized. Content guidelines (euphemism for censorship) exist, even as we write, i
n all major content providers (AOL, Yahoo, Lycos).}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This is the phase of consolidation. The number of players is severely reduced. The number of browser types is limited to 2-3 (Mozilla, Microsoft and which else
?). Networks merge to form privately owned mega-networks. Servers merge to form hyper-servers run on supercomputers or computer farms. The number of ISPs is considerably diminished.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch

 in 1983. The number in 1995 was 18. At the end of the century they numbered 6.}{\rtlch \af0 \ltrch 
\par }{\rtlch \af0\afs27 \ltrch \fs27 This is the stage when companies - fighting for financial survival - strive to acquire as many users/listeners/viewers as possible. The programming is dumbed down, 
aspiring to the lowest (and widest) common denominator. Shallow programming dominates as long as the bloodbath proceeds.
