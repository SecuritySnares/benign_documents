              <td valign="top"><p>Shared decision making can improve the quality and acceptance of decisions,   bolster worker motivation and self-esteem, increase sense of ownership and   improve interpersonal relations with employees. But it is not always easy to   delegate. A farmer wondered why his workers came directly to him with their   problems and questions, skipping right over the foreman. Upon further   reflection, this grower realized that he was encouraging this behavior by   answering questions and solving problems for the employees. Instead, he needed   to support his foreman by having employees go to him with these matters. </p>
                  <p>There is a tricky balance, here, however. While workers should feel a need to   work out day to day issues directly with the farm foreman, the door should be   left open for workers to sense that the farmer can listen to them, too. At one   farm operation, the grower made it clear to the employees that his door was open   to listen if they ever needed to talk. As soon as the farmer would leave the   field, however, the foreman would close that door, by telling employees that   they were <em>not to ever bother the grower</em>. </p>
                <p>Delegation and empowerment work best when it is done in small increments. In   an effort to get some of that <em>empowerment potion</em> into personnel, where   employees will see things with managerial eyes, sometimes farm employers will   over-delegate. And when the employee fails, much of this decision making or   responsibility is taken away from personnel. Instead, as the employee succeeds   at increasingly more difficult tasks, more can be delegated. When delegating, it   is a wonderful feeling to know the employee will do the job just as well, if not   better, than one would. To accomplish this, the supervisor needs to test for   employee understanding before delegating. </p>
                <p>One dairy farmer wanted to delegate to a working herdsman some decisions   based on cow body condition. They had been working together on this project for   some time. This dairyman selected one hundred cows and evaluated their body   condition. Then, after explaining what he was doing, gave the same list of cows   to the herdsman, and had him do his own evaluations from scratch. When he was   finished, the two were able to compare notes and discuss each cow individually. </p>
                <p>When a farmer employs a new foreman, rather than having this supervisor   evaluate the workers directly, it is preferable that both go out together to   look at the work. Once removed from the workers, they can talk. The grower can   first ask the foreman for his opinion and only then share his own feelings.   After coming to an agreement, both can return to view the jobs being carried   out, but this time, rather than keeping quiet about the quality of work being   performed, the farmer allows the supervisor to be the one who gives feedback to   employees on the quality of the work. This way the farmer can make sure the   supervisor has understood him well, and at the same time the employees can see   that the new foreman has the support of the grower. </p>
                <p>The first part of this chapter deals with the advantages and challenges   inherent in delegation. The second half focuses on communicating assignments to   employees, and following through to make sure jobs have been   completed.</p>
                
                  <p><strong>Involving Workers in Decision Making</strong><a name="o_1" id="o_1"></a><a href="#1">1</a>
                      <! [F]>
                  </p>
                <p>Decision making is the crux of management in any enterprise. In most business   organizations, responsibilities are divided between &quot;those who think&quot; and &quot;those   who do.&quot; Though farmers typically engage in more &quot;doing&quot; than the average   executive, often they also carry the whole thinking load. </p>
                <p>A strict separation of manager and employee roles sends the message to   workers that they are only responsible for what they are specifically told to   do. But how much stock might be saved, damage avoided, spoilage reduced, and   work improvement generated if the minds connected to all those hired hands were   tapped? Involving people in decision-making transfers power to subordinates. </p>
                <p>Some supervisors think failing to maintain tight control may be seen as a   sign of weakness. Others simply find their use of authority very satisfying.   Finally, there are those who are concerned their subordinates would not make   decisions or discharge responsibilities well. </p>
                
                  <p>Levels of involvement </p>
                <p>A supervisor may usefully include others in virtually every decision. <em>When</em> and <em>to what extent</em> to involve workers are key management   choices. There are several approaches to decision making. At one extreme is the   traditional use of managerial authority in decision making or the   &quot;boss-centered&quot; style. At the opposite is a management style with high worker   involvement, an &quot;employee-centered&quot; style. Five approaches within such a   continuum are discussed in this sub-section to illustrate the differences in   decision-making philosophy.<a name="o_2" id="o_2"></a><a href="#2">2</a>
                    <! [F]>
                  This categorization of decision-making approaches can be applied to any kind of   management decision. </p>
                <p>1. &nbsp;<em>Tell them</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor makes the decision and announces it. He   identifies a problem, considers alternative solutions, chooses one, and then   reports it to subordinates as an order for implementation. He may or may not   consider what employees will think about the decision. In any case, he provides   no chance for them to participate in the decision-making process: &quot;Please go   ahead and start baling the alfalfa now.&quot;</p>
                <p>2. &nbsp;<em>Sell them</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor makes the decision and explains her   reasoning to employees in an effort to gain their acceptance of it. She takes   responsibility for identifying the problem and generating the solution, but she   recognizes the possibility of some resistance among those who will have to   execute it. She may indicate to employees what they have to gain from her   decision: &quot;Start baling now. It has dried enough to keep from molding, and it   may get too tricky to handle if we let it dry any more.&quot;</p>
                <p>3. &nbsp;<em>Check with them</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor presents his decision as an idea   and invites questions and comments. Here the boss has arrived at a tentative   decision but provides an explanation of his thinking and gives subordinates an   opportunity to influence it. He retains the initiative for diagnosing the   problem and the final decision for himself but solicits reactions from affected   employees: &quot;I&rsquo;m thinking of buying that new XK tractor. It has plenty of power   for the money and Simoes says his has been very reliable. What do you think,   given what we have to use it for?&quot;</p>
                <p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Include them</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss presents a problem, asks employees for   ideas and suggestions, and then makes her decision. Again, the supervisor   ultimately decides, but the employees provide and analyze much of the   information on which the decision is based. The boss benefits from their   knowledge and experience: &quot;Our records show we had twice as many back injuries   during harvest this year as in any of the previous five. Why do you think it   happened, and what can I do about it for the next year?&quot;</p>
                <p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Involve them</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor passes to employees the   decision-making responsibility. He points to the existence of a problem,   outlines constraints on solutions, and essentially commits himself to accepting   whatever the employees decide within prescribed boundaries. The employees   diagnose the problem and consider alternative ways of handling it. If the boss   participates in the decision-making process, he does so as an equal member of   the group involved: &quot;We&rsquo;ve got to plant all twenty sections by Wednesday, and   only six of our rigs are working. Let me know if you guys can possibly get it   done, how, and what extra expenses we&rsquo;ll have to incur.&quot;</p>
                <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Regardless of approach, the supervisor needs to carefully communicate with   subordinates about their role in the decision process. For example, a supervisor   may only want to check out a decision he intends to make himself, but workers   get the idea he is delegating the responsibility to them. Confusion and   resentment are likely to follow. </p>
                <p>Bound for even greater difficulty is the supervisor who knows exactly what he   wants and tries using a &quot;democratic front&quot; to get workers to think his idea is   theirs. Most people can smell that act coming a kilometer away. </p>
                <p>Even if he wants to involve employees as much as possible, a supervisor   cannot delegate any more responsibility than he himself has been given by his   own boss. Clear limits need to be set. Of course, employees will lose their   taste for involvement if no action results from the decision they help make. </p>
                <p>Several factors bear on the desirability of the various alternatives. In   general, they can be grouped as attributes of the supervisor, the employee(s),   or the situation.</p>
                <p><em>Attributes of the supervisor</em></p>
                <p>A supervisor&rsquo;s own beliefs and personality usually predispose her to favor   more or less employee involvement. </p>
                <DIR>
                  <p>1. <em>Value system</em>. Some supervisors strongly believe employees should   participate in decisions affecting them. Others feel involving workers in   management work is passing the buck. Such views obviously influence the approach   to decision making. Another key value question is the relative importance the   supervisor attaches to short-term efficiency and long-term employee development.   The latter is more consistently served by involvement. </p>
                  <p>2. <em>Need for control and certainty</em>. When a supervisor releases some   control over decision making, he reduces the predictability of its outcome.   Supervisors with more tolerance for ambiguity and surprise are more comfortable   delegating than their risk-averse counterparts. </p>
                  <p>3. <em>Leadership habits and inclinations</em>. Some supervisors seem to   function more naturally as highly directive leaders. Resolving problems and   issuing orders come easily to them. Others are more comfortable and experienced   in sharing their work with subordinates. Some supervisors perpetuate styles they   learned earlier in their careers. </p>
                  <p>4. <em>Confidence in subordinates</em>. Supervisors who have more trust in   other people generally, and in their subordinates specifically, are better able   to solicit and effectively utilize employee participation in decision making. </p>
                  </DIR>
                <p><em>Attributes of the employee</em></p>
                <p>A supervisor&rsquo;s confidence in his workers may depend partly on his general   inclinations but certainly ought to also be based upon employee ability and   interest. Most workers enjoy responsibility if they are given the training,   materials, time, and freedom to act. </p>
                <p>Some employees tend to be negative and blame everyone but themselves when   things go wrong. Others may only pretend to follow instructions. With their look   or voice they may say, &quot;see, it doesn&rsquo;t work.&quot; Some workers may try making the   supervisor feel guilty for delegating a task. One employee, for instance, scared   his supervisors into not assigning jobs to him with comments such as: &quot;What, you   want me to drop everything and do it right now!?&quot; Effective interpersonal skills   are critical when dealing with employees, especially when difficulties arise   (Chapters 12 &amp; 13). </p>
                <p>Individuals do respond differently to decision-making opportunities. It is   crucial to remember, however, that most employees are capable of significantly   expanding their skills. How they develop is partly influenced by their   supervisor&rsquo;s expectations of them.</p>
                <p>Hispanics and other minorities are often categorized as coming from cultures   not appreciating participation. Despite cultural differences, people of all   cultures display a broad range of behavior. When it comes to worker   participation, Hispanic and minority workers are just as interested&mdash;or   uninterested&mdash;as their majority colleagues. </p>
                <p>The foreman with enough confidence in a worker to delegate part of an   important decision is likely to be rewarded with both an immediate contribution   and a more experienced, confident employee to whom she can delegate even more   tomorrow. You have probably heard about a &quot;troublemaker&quot; or &quot;goof-off&quot; from one   ranch who moved on to become a highly valued performer at another. Though   personal circumstances often play a role in such turnabouts, so do different   management styles. Some workers give the job their best as long as the   supervisor stays away.</p>
                <p>Involving employees is usually more productive if workers possess the   following: </p>
                <DIR>
                  <p>1. Knowledge and experience relevant to the issue at hand. </p>
                  <p>2. Interest in the issue and appreciation of its importance. </p>
                  <p>3. Understanding of, and overall agreement with, goals of the business. </p>
                  <p>4. Desire for autonomy, responsibility and growth. </p>
                  <p>5. Tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity, as opposed to need for firm   structure. </p>
                  <p>6. Previous involvement in decision making. </p>
                  </DIR>
                <p><em>Attributes of the situation </em></p>
                <p>Finally, the appropriate approach varies with the situation. </p>
                <p>1. <em>The problem itself</em>. More involvement is called for when (a)   information relevant to the problem is widely dispersed in the organization, and   (b) employee acceptance is critical to the implementation of whatever decision   is made. Identifying the cause of a rash of equipment breakdowns cannot be done   alone in the comfort of one&rsquo;s own office. </p>
                <p>Complex decisions require broader involvement but simple ones may be   delegated directly to those employees who have the necessary information. Who is   better situated than the tractor driver to decide when to fill its gas tank?</p>
                <p>Most decisions recurring routinely, such as tank filling, supply ordering,   and stock culling, are permanently delegated through job descriptions. Managers   can exert considerable control over delegated decisions by narrowing the   decision-maker&rsquo;s area of discretion.</p>
                <p>An observant labor contractor once noted his workers took much better care of   their own equipment than his. Similarly, people are more likely to accept and   implement decisions they have participated in making.</p>
                <p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Time pressures</em>. In the short run shared decision making generally   takes longer than unilateral action. It is not surprising to find crisis-ridden   ranches that often operate with a highly authoritarian management style. The   pattern perpetuates itself since boss-centered responses to crises do little to   develop staff capacity. </p>
                <p>3. &nbsp;<em>Organizational traditions and values</em>. Organizations tend to   select, promote, and retain people who fit in with their prevailing management   philosophy. &quot;The way we&rsquo;ve always done it here&quot; has a profound impact on how it   will be done in the future. </p>
                <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Research has found more participatory approaches are, in general, associated   with higher levels of employee motivation, acceptance of and adaptability to   change, managerial decision quality, teamwork and morale, and individual   employee development. When decision-making responsibilities are shared,   slumbering organizations often &quot;wake up.&quot; Workers will increase their   expectations of both themselves and the organization.</p>
                <p><strong>Delegation Follow Through</strong></p>
                <p>The previous discussion dealt with the who, what, and why of delegating   decisions. Following through is just as important but much simpler. Whether   delegating menial jobs or high-powered decision-making assignments, there are   some basic requirements. At the very least, employees need to understand clearly   what is expected of them and when their assignments are due to be completed. </p>
                <p>Do you find yourself delegating work but sometimes wondering when or if it   got done? Do you ever feel uneasy about checking up on the worker, fearing you   may convey a feeling of mistrust? If you answered yes to either of these   questions, you may want to try a work-order form (see Figure 10-1). You can   design a form to fit your needs. A separate form can be used per job, or a   single one can serve for many positions.</p>

            <tr>
              <td valign="top"><br />
                  <p>The form is not a substitute for clear communication. With new employees or   tasks, you will want to provide training and close supervision. Employees who do   not understand what is expected of them need to feel comfortable asking for   clarification.</p>
                <p>The form provides a place to tell employees what you want them to do, how   important this task is in comparison to other tasks assigned to them, when the   request was given, and how soon you expect it to be completed. The priority code   along with the &quot;date wanted&quot; helps employees prioritize their efforts in accord   to what is most important to you.</p>
                <p>Workers can be trained to communicate with you when given unrealistic   assignments. For instance, they may want to negotiate for a later completion   date. With time employees grasp what is most important to you and you can skip   the &quot;date wanted&quot; section.</p>
                <p>In some cases you may want to go over assignments with employees and ask for   their input on a reasonable completion date&mdash;or a timetable with a series of   sub-goals. If it is a job you want to check on at specific intervals, you may   indicate this on the form, too. If several unrelated tasks are delegated, it   helps to use different forms to track each one.</p>
                <p>The middle part of the form consists of typical tasks you delegate to the   employee, as well as space to provide specific instructions. The list of   delegated tasks may be refined with time, so you may not want to print too many   forms the first time.</p>
                <p>The bottom left of the form has a space for you to initial your request. The   employee will, upon completion of the assignment, also initial and date the   form. Finally, to complete the feedback process, you will initial the form   (bottom right) thanking the employee. From time to time you will want to add an   extra word of positive feedback and encouragement to express your gratitude,   such as, &ldquo;well done!&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Employees experience the satisfaction of completing, and being thanked for,   specific assignments. Of course, comments of gratitude remain of great   importance. A worker lamented the fact that the farmer would tell everyone else   what a great job he was doing, but had never told him directly.</p>
                <p>With such forms, employees do not have to guess what is important to their   boss. Forms also serve as a performance history. Records may also provide useful   data for job analyses, job evaluations, or performance appraisals (as well as   on-going feedback). Planning worker training or conducting a disciplinary   procedure may also be facilitated. </p>
                <p>You may want to keep extra blank forms handy in your pick-up or at home.   Employees need to keep blank forms, too, as an easy way of letting you know   about tasks they have carried out on their own initiative, or when completing   assignments for which you did not provide a form. </p>
                <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
                <p>Shared decision making can lead to better decisions, increase communication   with employees, bolster worker motivation, and increase acceptance of difficult   decisions. While delegation may save time in the long run, it takes more time in   the short term. Circumstances are critical, as are both the supervisor&rsquo;s and the   subordinate&rsquo;s skills and perspectives. Whether delegating routine jobs or   important decision-making assignments, supervisors also need to assure   instructions are clear, communicate the limits of the shared decision-making   power, and see tasks are carried out in a timely fashion. </p>
