It has been argued that by displacing the confused and fragmented case-law which has emerged when applying the non-discrimination principle, a market access test would not only introduce greater doctrinal coherence into a currently confused area of law; b

The purpose of this paper is to examine in more detail the relationship between the proposed market access principle and the concept of regulatory competition.  We ar
gue that a move to market access would be helpful in clarifying the issues at stake over regulatory competition. At the same time we question whether an }{\i\fs24 unqualified}{\fs24 
 market access principle would achieve the benefits which regulatory competition is meant to
 bring about.  On the contrary, unless the emerging economic jurisprudence of the Court addresses legitimate concerns about the effects of the market access principle on Member State autonomy, the market access test will struggle to gain acceptance.  

\par Our focus on regulatory competition may need some justification.  The stated aim of the EC rules on free movement is not regulatory competition, but market integration.}{\cs18\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s22\ql \li0\ri0\sl480\slmult1

les also have the effect of protecting what can be seen as fundamental rights in the economic sphere.  The debate over regulatory competition, by contrast, is concerned with arrangements for rule-making and the division of powers between state-level bodie
s and transnational entities, an apparently separate set of issues.
\par On closer inspection, however, it becomes clear that market access and regulatory competition are two sides of the same coin.  Within a federal constitutional framework (or in a transnation
al entity such as the EC), mobility of economic resources is one of the first preconditions for the emergence of a market in legal rules.  When courts review laws of Member States against criteria of how far such laws obstruct, or promote, economic mobili
t
y, they are necessarily defining the scope and nature of regulatory competition.  Their approach to market access will therefore have profound implications for the nature of the law-making process and for the content of legal rules in a variety of substan
t
ive areas as well as for the division of powers, and the doctrines of preemption and subsidiarity.  Given the importance of the issues at stake, it would be preferable if these considerations were to be more clearly articulated by the courts as part of a 
m
arket access test.  This would engender a more meaningful debate on the effects of free movement jurisprudence and its relationship to other areas of EC policy making, including harmonising Directives and other forms of policy intervention such as the ope
n method of coordination (OMC).  As part of this debate, it should be possible to set more coherent limits to the market access principle than has hitherto been the case.
\par In developing this argument we outline in section 2 the theoretical foundation of regu
latory competition, the so-called pure theory of decentralised law-making, and draw out its legal implications.  We then move on in section 3 to a closer examination of the predominant conception of regulatory competition in practice, which we refer to as
 the model of \'93competitive federalism\'94
, and examine its implications for the market-access test. We find that decisions which make adequate sense when expressed in the customary doctrinal language of free movement and market integration often appear inconsi
stent when seen through the lens of competitive federalism. In section 4 we argue that much of the difficulty stems from problems with the idea of \'93competitive federalism\'94
, and we consider alternative approaches, both in respect of legislation and judicial intervention, which acknowledge space for diversity in rule-making between the Member States.  Section 5 concludes.

\par }{\b\fs24 2. Regulatory competition: theoretical underpinnings
\par }{\fs24 
\par The term \'93regulatory competition\'94 refers to a process whereby legal rules are select
ed (and de-selected) through competition between decentralised, rule-making entities (which could be nation states or other units such as regions or localities).  Three justifications are normally given for regulatory competition: firstly, it allows the c
ontent of rules to be matched more effectively to the preferences or }{\i\fs24 wants}{\fs24 
 of the consumers of laws (citizens and others affected); secondly, it promotes diversity and experimentation in the search for effective legal solutions; and thirdly, by providing me
chanisms for preferences to be expressed and alternative solutions compared, it promotes the flow of information on effective law making.

\fs22  416.}}}{\fs24  the mechanism through which competition operates is mobility of persons and resources across jurisdictional boundaries.  In his \'93pure theory\'94 of fiscal federalism, local authorities compete to attract residents by offeri
ng packages of services in return for levying taxes at differential rates.  Consumers with homogenous wants then \'93cluster\'94
 in particular localities.  The effect is to match local preferences to particular levels of service provision, thereby maximising the satisfaction of wants while maintaining diversity and promoting information flows between jurisdictions.
\par Tiebout\rquote s model can be applied to laws since they, like public services, have the character of what economists refer to as indivisible public goods, t
hat is to say, they cannot easily be priced individually because of issues of non-excludability. Hence collective consumption is more cost-efficient.  Laws, then, are seen as products which jurisdictions }{\i\fs24 supply}{\fs24 
 through their law-making activities, in response to the }{\i\fs24 demands}{\fs24 
 of consumers of the laws, that is, individuals, companies and other affected parties.  If supply and demand can be brought into equilibrium, then, in the terminology of welfare economics, }{\i\fs24 static}{\fs24  or }{\i\fs24 allocative}{\fs24 
 efficiency will be maximised.  This is another way of saying that the wants or preferences of the various parties will have been satisfied to the greatest possible extent. 
\par At the heart of this conception of regulatory competition is decentralisation.  The process cannot work unless effective rule-making authority is exercised by entities operating at a devolved or local level.  It is argued that a centralised or \'93
monopoly\'94 regulator would, by contrast, behave like any other monopoly; contrary to the normal laws of supply and demand, the price of the product goes up while the quantity supplied diminishes, so driving a wedge (a \'93social cost\'94
) between an optimal economic outcome and what actually occurs.  To avoid this outcome implies conferring law-making powers on lower-level units, su
bject only to the principle that there must be some level below which further decentralisation becomes infeasible because of diseconomies of scale.  
\par Perhaps the best known case of regulatory competition is
 the so-called Delaware effect in US corporations law. Over 40% of New York stock-exchange-listed companies, and over 50% of Fortune 500 companies, are incorporated in Delaware.  Some commentators have argued that Delaware\rquote 
s success in attracting such a high level of company incorporations has been achieved by lowering standards.}{\cs18\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \qj \fi-720\li720\ri0\sl480\slmult1\widctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin720\itap0

with regard to centralised judicial review of national-level regulation.  This is because, in a }{\i\fs24 perfectly}{\fs24

e for the factors of production to decide whether or not to quit that state for one which provided a more appropriate regulatory regime.  Hence voters who were unhappy with a state\rquote 
s alcohol advertising ban would exit to what they regarded as a more congenial legal regime, while labour-only subcontractors would shun a country which applied its labour standards in an over-rigid way.  
\par Taking the process back one stage, such laws could be avoided in the first place in so far as their negative effects imposed 
a potential cost on legislators in the jurisdictions adopting them.  If such laws reduced the wealth of the citizens of the country concerned, legislators would, it is presumed, have an incentive to avoid adopting them (this would be the case if the well-
b
eing of the legislators was linked to the well-being of the country in some way).  On the other hand, it might well be the case that citizens (and legislators acting on their behalf) prefer to pay the price for having high standards in areas of product sa
f
ety and social policy.  They may prefer, in other words, to trade off a part of national wealth in return for social redistribution or environmental protection.  If this is the case, there is nothing in the pure theory to say that they should not have the
 right to do so.  A federal judicial body should no more prevent the exercise of local-level sovereignty by striking down such laws, than a federal legislature should seek to occupy the field at their expense.

try and exit are met.  If any such formal barriers exist they must be removed.  Thus, according to the formal market access approach it is sufficient that the goods be allowed onto the foreign market, irrespective of how difficult it is in practice for th
o
se goods actually to be sold once they have gained access to that market.  By contrast, the substantive sense of the notion of market access focuses on these very practical difficulties experienced once the goods have penetrated the market, and requires t
h
at these be eliminated.  To give an example, the formal approach to market access would require a German rule banning the importation of French Cassis into Germany to be struck down.  The substantive approach would require not only formal access of French
 cassis to the market (the removal of the import ban) but also, potentially, the elimination of any quality requirements that the French cassis would have to comply with.

 access being denied, the access being that of Centros Ltd. to the Danish market.  What was really at stake, tho
ugh, was the access of Mr. and Mrs. Bryde, the founders of Centros Ltd., to incorporation procedures of UK company law.  The Brydes incorporated Centros Ltd. in England  for the purpose of avoiding the Danish law relating to minimum capital requirements f
o
r privately-held companies.  Apparently they never intended that Centros Ltd. would trade in the UK.  This was the reason given by the company registrar for his decision; to allow Centros Ltd. to trade in Denmark would be to condone an abuse of Danish com
pany legislation.  
\par In finding that the registrar\rquote s decision contravened the principle of freedom of establishment under Article 43 (subject to the possibility of justification), the Court assumed that a }{\i\fs24 substantive}{\fs24 
 barrier to the exercise by Mr. and Mrs. B
ryde of the right to incorporate their business in the UK was sufficient for it to be intervene.  Thus, this was not a case of a formal barrier to access.  The Brydes were not formally prevented from incorporating Centros Ltd. in the UK.  It was simply th
at the decision to deny them the right to trade through Centros Ltd. in Denmark removed the (substantive) benefit of doing so.  Nor was }{\i\fs24 Centros}{\fs24  a case in which a test of non-discrimination was applied.  }{\i\fs24 Centros}{\fs24

national measures liable to hinder or make less attractive the exercise of fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty\'94. He, nevertheless, argued that these tests related \'93
solely to the sorts of formal conditions of access to the employment market which were at issue in those\'85cases\'94.   He favoured a test under which \'93
neutral national rules could only be deemed to constitute material barriers to market access, if it were established that they had actual effects on market actors akin to exclusion from the m
arket. As in the case of rules regarding selling arrangements in the case of goods, there can be no presumption that neutral national commercial regulations, or those governing pay scales, social protection and other matters of concern to workers, have th
is effect.\'94 
\par As we have seen, the Court in }{\i\fs24 Graf}{\fs24 , relying on a number of pre-}{\i\fs24 Keck}{\fs24  cases, identified certain effects which were \'93too uncertain and indirect\'94
 to hinder free movement of persons.  Thus, the national employment legislation in question did not fall under the scrutiny of EC law and national diversity was maintained.  One aspect of }{\i\fs24 Graf}{\fs24 
 is that the rule in question was regarded as applying in a non-discriminatory manner.  In }{\i\fs24 Keck}{\fs24 , also, the Court identified }{\i\fs24 non-discriminatory}{\fs24  certain selling arrangem
ents as another area which would never be subject to review.  As Advocate General Tesauro noted in }{\i\fs24 H\'fcnermund}{\fs24 ,}{\cs18\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s22\qj \fi-720\li720\ri0\sl480\slmult1

 the purpose of the Community rules in respect of the free movement of goods was to liberalise }{\i\fs24 inter-state}{\fs24  trade or and not to encourage the unhindered pursuit of commerce in the individual Member States. In these 
cases, then, the Court accepted that provided formal access to the market was permitted, it would not review other measures which might (more substantively) hinder market access. 
\par What marks out }{\i\fs24 Graf}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 Keck}{\fs24  as cases in which a test of formal market access was appropriate?  We have already noted the unsatisfactory aspects of the \'93selling arrangements\'94 concept used in }{\i\fs24 Keck}{\fs24 
.  In }{\i\fs24 Graf}{\fs24 , as we have seen, the Court concluded that any negative effect of the rule being challenged was too \'93uncertain and indirect\'94, 
a formula which itself does little to dispel uncertainty.  The Court argued that since it was uncertain that Graf would have received compensation upon the termination of employment in any event, for him to lose it by resigning his job to take up an emplo
y
ment in another Member State could not be said to be a sufficient deterrent to freedom of movement.  This prompts the question of what the Court would have decided had it been clearer that Graf would otherwise have qualified for compensation.  A rule whic
h was discriminatory or which was non-discriminatory but substantially hindered access to the market would have been subjected to closer scrutiny.  
\par However, what more clearly sets }{\i\fs24 Graf}{\fs24  aside from decisions such as }{\i\fs24 Centros}{\fs24  is that Graf was claiming, in effe
ct, for a kind of levelling up of labour standards.  The logic of his claim was that the standards of employment protection operating under the Austrian law on termination of employment should be }{\i\fs24 raised}{\fs24 
 in such a way as to make it easier for workers to exe
rcise rights of entry and exit.  If this principle had been accepted, an inverted form of mutual recognition would have been established, under which Member States would have been required to come up to the standards of the most protective jurisdiction in
 relation to the treatment of migrant workers.  It is not surprising that the Court, faced with the invitation to initiate a forced \'93race to the top\'94
, declined to do so, stressing instead the autonomy of Member States in the labour law field.  However, the resulting stress on formal access as the relevant test stands in stark contrast to the emphasis, in }{\i\fs24 Centros}{\fs24 
, on ensuring that the substantive freedom of movement was protected.  
\par In comparing }{\i\fs24 Centros}{\fs24  and }{\i\fs24 Graf}{\fs24 , it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that t
he Court was content to accept a test of substantive market access when it came to striking down national level regulation, only to revert to a test of formal access when it would have had the effect of requiring Member States to level up to a higher degr
ee of social protection.  Hence the difficulty with an open-ended, substantive market access test is that, in the words of Advocate General Fennelly, it will be \'93
exploited as a means of challenging any national rules whose effect is simply to limit commercial freedom\'94.}{\cs18\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s22\qj \li0\ri0\sl480\slmult1\widctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0

  By contrast, a more restrictive, formal access test has the merit of protecting national legislative autonomy: goods have access to the French market but they cannot be resold at a
 loss and workers can work in Austria and Germany but they cannot challenge the validity of national employment legislation under EC law.
\par To sum up the argument so far: the crucial determinants of a market access test are whether access is defined formally
 or substantively, and whether discrimination between nationals of the host state and those of other Member States is required for the Court\rquote 
s intervention to be triggered.  Across the range of free movement cases, we find surprisingly little consistency i
n the approach of the Court; its decisions range all the way from those in which a substantive access test is coupled with the absence of a discrimination requirement, to those in which a formal access test is adopted.  These cases may be explained in par
t by historical accident and their place in the development of a complex jurisprudence by the Court of Justice.  Nevertheless, such explanations do not help with clarity.  This uncertainty is compounded when we look more closely at the Court\rquote 
s approach to the application of justifying factors.

  The essence of reflexive law is the acknowledgement that regulatory interventions are most likely to be successful when they seek to achieve their ends not by direct prescription, but by inducing \'93second-order effects\'94
 on the part of social actors.  In other words, this approach aims to \'93couple\'94 external regulation with self-regulatory processes.  Reflexive law therefore has a }{\i\fs24 procedural orientation}{\fs24 .  What this means, in the context of 
economic regulation, is that the preferred mode of intervention is for the law to underpin and encourage autonomous processes of adjustment, in particular by supporting mechanisms of group representation and participation, rather than to intervene by impo
s
ing particular distributive outcomes.  This type of approach finds a concrete manifestation in legislation which seeks, in various ways, to devolve or confer rule-making powers to self-regulatory processes.  Examples are laws which allow collective bargai
ning by trade unions and employers to make qualified exceptions to limits on working time or similar labour standards,}{\cs18\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s22\qj \li0\ri0\sl480\slmult1\widctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0

See J Black, }{\i\fs22 Rules and Regulators}{\fs22  (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998).}}}{\fs24 
\par A procedural orientation also implies an important difference in the way in which the law responds to market failures or externalities from the way in wh
ich it is normally represented in the law and economics literature.  Reflexive regulation does not seek to \'93perfect\'94
 the market, in the sense of reproducing the outcome which parties would have arrived at in the absence of transaction costs (the so-called \'93hypothetical bargaining\'94
 standard).  This is partly because it is understood that information problems facing courts and legislatures make the process of identifying an \'93optimal\'94 bargaining solution extremely hazardous.  It is also because of a perception
 that the essence of competition is that it is a process of discovery or adaptation, rather than the achievement of optimal states or distributions.  
\par In the context we are considering here, this implies a particular role for the transnational harmonisatio
n of laws.  The purpose of harmonisation would not be to substitute for state-level regulation; hence, the transnational standard would not operate to \'93occupy the field\'94 in the manner of a \'93monopoly regulator\'94
, but instead to promote diverse, local-level a
pproaches to regulatory problems by creating a space for autonomous solutions to emerge when, because of market failures, they would not otherwise do so.  This may involve what some regard as a restriction of competition, in the sense of ruling out certai
n options which could be associated with a \'93race to the bottom\'94, while leaving others open.  As we have seen, this is a familiar technique in labour law, where directives mostly set basic labour standards as a \'93floor of rights\'94
, allowing member states to improve on these provisions but, on the whole, preventing \'93downwards\'94 derogations.  Reflexive harmonisation operates to induce individual states to enter into a \'93race to the top\'94
 when they would have otherwise have an incentive do nothing (the \'93reverse free rider\'94 effect) or to compete on the basis of the withdrawal of protective standards (the \'93race to the bottom\'94
).  This is done by giving states a number of options for implementation as well as by allowing for the possibility that existing, self-regulatory 
mechanisms can be used to comply with EU-wide standards.  In these ways, far from suppressing regulatory innovation, harmonisation aims to stimulate it.
\par Another form of reflexive harmonisation can be seen in the use of OMC.  OMC involves \'93fixing guidelines
 for the Union, establishing quantitative and qualitative indicators and benchmarks as a means of comparing best practice, translating these European guidelines into national and regional policies by setting specific targets, and periodic monitoring, eval
uation and peer review organised as \'93mutual learning processes\'94.}{\cs18\fs24\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s22\qj \li0\ri0\sl480\slmult1\widctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs20\lang2057\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp2057\langfenp1033 {

\par In this chapter we have reviewed part of the free movement jurisprudence of the Court through the lens of a law and economics analysis, with a view to considering how far it discloses a cohe
rent approach to the question of regulatory competition.  Viewing the Court\rquote s rulings through an }{\i\fs24 ex post}{\fs24 
 set of analytical classifications might strike some as unusual.  The justification for doing so is two fold.  Firstly, while regulatory competition may not be the aim of the Court\rquote 
s interventions, it is certainly one of its most significant effects.  Secondly, law and economics analysis of this kind is widely used to understand the workings of market integration rules in other federal or transnational ju
risdictions, in particular the United States, where argument has raged over the benefits of the market for legal rules in areas such as corporations law.  When these techniques are applied to the free movement case law of the Court, we see a surprising la
ck of consistency.  The Court veers between an approach, in cases such as }{\i\fs24 Centros}{\fs24 , which combines a strong substantive market access test, to one, in cases such as }{\i\fs24 Keck}{\fs24 , which would limit the Court\rquote 
s intervention to situations in which formal access is barr
ed or there is clear evidence of discrimination against non home-state nationals.  From the point of view of regulatory competition, it is beside the point to argue that one case arises under the law governing establishment and the other is concerned with
 goods, since the effects are largely the same in both cases.  At the very least, we would expect the Court to offer some explanation of the divergence in approach in this and other cases, but none has been forthcoming.
\par \tab In addition to inconsistency, the Court\rquote 
s approach risks the worst of both worlds: a race to uniformity, which is also a race to the bottom in the sense of leading to the degradation of standards of market regulation.  Because the market access principle is not clearly articulated as such, t
he importance of this process for the debate over the substance of economic and social policy in the EC is being obscured.  The case for a more explicit consideration of these questions is further reinforced by the emergence of clear alternatives to court
-
led deregulation, in the form of reflexive harmonisation and novel regulatory techniques such as the open method of coordination and, as far as the Court itself is concerned, experimentalism.  The need for all parties, including the Court, to articulate m
