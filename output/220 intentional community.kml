Black Bulga is a small intentional community of people who are custodians of a beautiful piece of land in the Upper Monkerai Valley – in the foothills of the Barrington Wilderness, New South Wales, Australia.

We strive to live in harmony with nature and with each other, and to tread lightly on the earth. We share a vision of just and sustainable future and actively engage in the world to help make this vision a reality. As part of this vision, we intend to create an inspiring educational, arts and ecology centre to actively engage the wider community in our work for social change towards a more ecological and just society. 

We are a group of passionate people who are ambitious about creating a sustainable future, and who are willing to work hard to enact our vision on our land for the benefit of our community and others

In early 2010, we purchased a beautiful block of land at the confluence of the Karuah and Teleghery rivers on the edge of the Barrington wilderness. Something about the sweet taste of the river water, the cool, deep swimming holes, stunning views and fertile soil made it easy for our group to realise that we had finally found the place we had been looking for.

Email us for further details. Note: Our joining process requires potential new members to visit regularly, so it's probably not feasible for people residing in other countries to join. Visitors are welcome.

The Atwater Resources Cooperative (ARC) is a growing informal co-housing community in an ethnically and economically diverse neighborhood of New Haven, Connecticut -- learn more about our area at chathamsquare.ning.com, or Google &quot;Fair  Haven&quot;.  We are working among ourselves and with others to create a socially just, environmentally sustainable and spiritually fulfilling human society. We believe that living with people who share these goals gives us our best chance of making real progress, and enjoying the process. We have no overarching ideology but are inspired by permaculture and the Transition Towns model of economic re-localization. Some of us actually read Yes! from cover to cover (yesmagazine.org).

We are four blocks from the Quinnipiac River, which flows into the harbor, and within easy walking distance of schools, a library branch, a senior center, restaurants and shopping, a farmers' market, a community bank, and bus routes; we're also a short hop to I-91 and I-95, and ten minutes to the train and bus station.  

Prospective members can rent an apartment or a room in a shared apartment in one of the houses owned by community members, or buy or rent a nearby house or apartment.  People can choose whatever level of involvement in our activities suits them. Also, there's no need to live with us to be part of our activities.

Hidden away on five private acres in sunny southwest Florida, GYMNOS is a land-based, naturist tribe in formation.  A spacious house, studio, garage workshop, post and beam barn, open pasture, citrus grove, vegetable garden and nature trails all support a dream of healthy, land-based self-sufficiency.  GYMNOS is on its way to becoming a small tribe that is on a return to life in harmony with nature, loving each other selflessly, sharing resources and ideas and living with freedom. We are also full-time naturists which means we live together without clothing at all times.  We expect to outgrow our five acres soon and are looking at relocation to a much larger rural land base in the near future.   For more detailed information check our website and blog posts.  At this time we are only welcoming visitors who are seriously interested in joining us.  An email dialog and subsequent phone conversation is essential.

+ Community is the center of our life

Neighbors following Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/springwater/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/springwater/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
//COMMMUNITY DESCRIPTION//
Springwater is a lay-led and covenanted neighborhood-rooted church of Anabaptist conviction.  We're in ten houses (19 members and novices, 12 kids, many chickens, 3 dogs) within a 5-minute walk

We gather around practices which express shared values such as simplicity, nonviolence, mutual discernment, and justice-seeking.  Our pocket of Portland's eclectic Lents neighborhood is the arena for us to experiment with working all that out.

We gather weekly with a meal to celebrate what Jesus has been up to in the neighborhood.  We also gather mid-week either for a neighborhood initiative/project/activity/event, a family business meeting, or small discipling groups.  Households and clusters of households meet up throughout the week over meals according to their own schedule and hopes.

Oh, and a lot of us bicycle and vegetable garden.  :)

Wolf Den Hollow is a four and a half acre property located 7 miles outside Duvall, Washington and 40 minutes east of Seattle.
We are located near the Wilderness Awareness School in Stossel Creek.  
We intent to create a long-term small-nature conscious community here. We currently have two cabins, one duplex cabin, a yurt and bedroom as dwelling units. With visions of new alternative dwellings in the works..  This last year we started building a  Cedar-hot-tub structure by one of our Cedar groves bordering a marsh. As well as a Earth Temple for gatherings, ceremony and spiritual practices. We envision bringing people together who share a passion for becoming Self-Sustainable through Gardening and Stewarding the Earth. Survival Skills, and crafts. We are inspired by Earth based Spirituality and welcome kindred folk of all faiths that desire to live in harmony and live closer to nature..  We need people who want to contribute resources for the benefit of the whole.. Such as building a Greenhouse which is next on our project list as well as some financial support for basic land expenses.  We have a main house with communal Kitchen, Shower/Bathroom and small study lounge.  There are also two outhouses on the property. We border Mackworth State Forest which has endless trails that stretch into the Cascade mountain range.  Some Old Growth Cedar groves, and waterfalls within a hour hike.  We feel a urgency to start preparing to become self-reliant for we feel that we cannot depend on mainstream society for much longer.. No better way to do this than in a intentional community. Please email us if you are interested.</description>

We enjoy a balance of female/male people and are currently looking for men to join us.  A couple might be possible too.  Someone who already knows and loves the area, as well as who is open to the right long term (3+ years) situation is preferred but we are most interested in the right fit for all of us.   
 
If you are interested and experienced in farming and/or permaculture, that would be a plus as there are dreams and space to create..land with decent soils for a committed knowledgeable person and a fair bit of water.  

Life is busy so we try to live by our dreams and goals but be realistic and flexible too.  
We do put a major emphasis on health- both in body and spirit- and love the country rural life and place we live.
We are a mix of ages, the youngest being 30, the oldest 65.  Currently 3F, 1M.  
Teaching science, property management, artistry, retired and volunteering are some of the things that describe us.  Also biking, hiking, flowers, crafts, making yogurt, helping our elders and friends, mushrooming, traveling, dancing... We strive to live an ecologically regenerative lifestyle.
Join current AM stretching and meditation practice or not...  Shared activities are likely to arise here and there as we get to know each other, have time and interest.  
We do share a weekly meal together - our food preferences are all over the map but healthy for each of us.  We also meet monthly to review what's working well for everyone and what might need to be discussed.  

We live in a lovely peaceful hollow where the skies are dark at night and coyotes &amp;amp; owls abound.  We share an old but updated house with 6 bedrooms, one being for guests.  We are fairly quiet and enjoy the serenity here.  
Our closest large town is Keene and the whole Monadnock region is lovely with woods, rolling hills, lakes, streams and of course the mountain itself.  

We aim to make home life more fun, efficient and economic while enjoying each others camaraderie.  We have a warm interactive habitat here- a Home as opposed to a place to live.   For the best fit, you should be fairly neat and clean, positive and open minded, a good communicator, and willing to compromise. Perhaps you are also a bit wise but still growing &amp;amp; learning :).  
We drink very little if any and do not use recreations drugs.  We value a positive outlook on life, little drama and open communication.  

Rooms range from $450-$550 and include gas and electricity.  We pitch in for firewood, telephone, wifi and chores.  Well behaved pets are negotiable.

We'd love to hear from you.... please share a little about yourself and what appeals most to you about this situation and what group living experience you have.

We recognize the immensity of this work and seek to sustain one another in nourishing community and empower a worldview which honors the sacredness of all life.

We are a small collective of yoga practitioners and devotees who have a desire to share the teachings of yoga and spirituality in an informal setting. With a small core of permanent residents, and a revolving cast of interns and retreat attendees, we co-create a vibrant and diverse center for spiritual living. We are musical, fun-loving and devotional, having deep roots in Yogananda’s path of Kriya Yoga.
As the result of inner inspiration our outward lifestyle at the Sanctuary has been shaped by the values of permaculture, alternative energy, and intentional community. We embrace all of the gifts and challenges that come with living side by side with an array of differing energies, ages and perspectives while daily attuning ourselves to the One Reality behind all differences.
Although the teachings and lineage of Yogananda are emphasized we Love all true Masters and saints…..
Pleasant Valley Sanctuary is located on a secluded and truly charming stretch of the Sierra Nevada foothills in Northern California. We are a small, spiritual community living our highest ideals and sharing that process with others. Living off-grid since 2002 has allowed us to develop our own harmonious, workable homesteading model, that is centered around authentic experience of the Divine through meditation and yoga. We welcome those who want to experience the gifts of such a lifestyle for work exchanges or internships. We also have a busy schedule of structured retreats led by both residents and our extended spiritual community.
We believe, as the great yogi master Paramhansa Yogananda did, that small, spiritually committed communities with a cooperative spirit are both powerful tools for our own spiritual growth and the key ingredient to uplifting the planet.
Adjacent to state park land, the retreat acreage is a scenic blend of meadows, seasonal creeks with waterfalls and picturesque views of the rolling foothills that line the Yuba river canyon.
The retreat center serves as both the facility for visiting guests and as a sustainable homestead for the current long-term residents and co-founders.
Solar panels provide electricity, an artesian well flows with sweet water, and a large, booming garden/orchard yields much of the food year round.
The atmosphere is informal and homey, appealing to those who do not feel drawn to organized settings.

Hello!!!
We are a collective farm on corsica in our first year. We are currently in search of other families who would like to live on site with us, share our projects and join our children in homeschooling. Also those who are seeking a spiritual journey and a simple life in complete nature. We are all francophones and speak a little english, but are open to all who have a similar philosophy of living. 
We are between the mountains and the sea on corsica. We have another chalet awaiting a family, who lend a hand with our work in the garden, help us with our homemade products, and with construction projects on the property.
We are now keen on finding people who wish to stay for longer terms, and permanently. 
Send us an email if you have questions or would like to come see us on corsica.

We would like to share all the practical knowledge, the information, the technologies and at the end the solutions that we may discover, research and apply to this journey of ours. We will do all we can to animate, empower, educate and inspire all people we meet so they will be able to follow their own path towards a more possible, more balanced coexistence of races and species on the planet.

Here it is a crystal palace in the Winter, a cool refuge in the Summer, where Nature provides your needs if you coax her. To keep that unchanged, while becoming a part of the balance....to love the land that loves us...that is the mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/taking-liberties-camp/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/taking-liberties-camp/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This is a beautiful 20-acre piece of timberland in northern Washington, about 20 miles from the Canadian border, bordering the National Park. There is a cabin, a huge barn, septic hookup for two trailers, and a well. We are seeking members to form a communal-type, off-grid living arrangement. A visit is just a phone call away. Becoming a member requires loving breathtaking sunsets, wildlife, clean air, loving Nature, being willing to work to carve out your spot, paying a portion of the land payment, being open-minded and real. And loving chihuahuas. Any sharing other than work will be done by heart only.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21678&quot;&gt;City of God Villages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; A Christian Village&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/city-of-god-villages/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/city-of-god-villages/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
&quot;What would a community of Christians be like who truly believed and trusted in the words of Christ, &quot;I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these.&quot; John 14:12 

As the flood waters of secularism and immorality rise around Christians, the work of Christian evangelization and Christian charity will become more and more difficult and dangerous, in every sense of the word. One doesn't try to save a drowning person by jumping into the torrent with them when dry land is nearby along with the support of others. Communities such as that proposed by the City of God Villages offer the safety of a Christian environment - dry land - from which to reach out to others. 

The proposed City of God Village community will be based on the concept of the &quot;extended family,&quot; in which multiple generations of members function as a family unit, recapturing the many benefits of the natural extended family. Although each individual and nuclear family will be responsible for their own livelihood, the physical and spiritual well-being of each extended family will be the responsibility of its members. No Community members will be left in need. 

The Village should include businesses, such as shops, medical clinics, farm and manufacturing operations, providing work for at least half of the Community's members. The strategy of the Village should be to tailor its businesses and activities to the talents and callings of the members it serves. The revenues from the Village businesses, as well as the financial support from Community members that work outside of the Village, provide the funds for the Community's outreach programs.

We are living fairly harmoniously with a number of vegetarians on 11 beautiful acres near Mullumbimby NSW. 

We have space for more people on our current property. We are specifically looking for people who are vegan, basically drug-free and sober. Visitors may camp with us near the river.  Amenities are simple with electricity, water, fire pits, internet hub. 

We are hoping to have minimal cars, we have a van as a share-car.

Most buildings on the land are currently occupied, however there are a number of building projects including a geodesic dome, a guest hut, more compost toilets, with which help would be appreciated.


What we will create:
---------------------------

Our vision is for a co-owned, off grid, vegan community with few vehicles.
We are looking to purchase a larger property more suited to rural land sharing 
or possibly acquire a neighboring property if it becomes available.</description>

We do not follow any one path, any one school of thought, but rather, try to maintain an open space where each individual can express him or herself in his or her own unique way, and grow in his or her unique direction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/aldeia-coletivo-de-familias/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/aldeia-coletivo-de-familias/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a group of friends and families attempting to live together, and in harmony with nature. We believe in having a relationship with the land we live on.
We believe in community, in the sharing of resources, skills and ideas. Each member of our community has a skill to teach and a perspective to share, but we more than anything else, seek to be students; students of nature, of our common history, and of community living.</description>

Who Are We?

We are a small intercultural community called Finca Sagrada located in Southern Ecuador. Our farm, Finca Sagrada, is 13 acres of pasture and gardens and 500 hectares of mountain.  We are a biodynamic, organic and homa farm

Our websites are:

Website www.fincasagrada.com
Walter Moora www.growbg.org
Susan David Moora www.capitalmissions.com
Leisha Brand www.magicalforest.com 
David Hartley www.holistiq.com 

Our inspiration is the indigenous saying of the Americas that “neither the people of the North nor the South will thrive until the Eagle and the Condor fly as one.”   We work in accord with the Pachamama Alliance, which has taken this as its mission and is making great progress.

Finca Sagrada is a community birthed in gratitude where people can reconnect to the sacredness of the Earth and of our own being...
      ...where the Earth has rights equal to human beings...
                    ...as the Eagle and the Condor fly as one...
                                ...over a self-sustaining community.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21683&quot;&gt;Ashram West&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Enlightenment and Service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ashram-west/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ashram-west/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Ashram West was founded in 1997 and incorporated in California as a 501c3 non-profit organization in 2001 to inspire and guide gay-identified persons to enlightenment and to offer service to the community. There are both monks, i.e., dedicated member-practitioners, who may be residents or non-residents, and lay members. 

The teachings of Ashram West are based on Vedanta philosophy and traditional Hindu Tantra in the lineage of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda, that encourages the integration of all aspects of life with spirituality, including sexuality. Vedanta teaches that our fundamental nature is pure, perfect, and divine, and one specialty of Tantra is a whole body of spiritual technologies for developing greater awareness of the our true divine Self. We offer meditation instruction, spiritual coaching, and counseling for individuals, couples, or groups free of charge with donations gratefully accepted. All persons are welcome to enjoy the benefits of our community services and activities.

Although most ashram members are gay men, and residence is for men only, we also have non-gay women students who form part of our extended world-wide family, united by email and occasional personal visits. We invite men of any sexual-affectional orientation to apply for membership as monks. Celibacy is neither required nor preferred, but resident monks must conduct committed relationships, if any, in service of the community and its goals. Non-resident monks live according the Rule of the Order of Ashram West but are free to conduct relationships as they like. All resident monks contribute to the material support and physical maintenance of the community, and they may hold outside jobs as necessary to make this possible. 

Currently the ashram exists in a large one-bedroom apartment in Silver Lake with two permanent residents, including Brother William, the Founder and Spiritual Director. We are seeking a larger residence that will permit more monks and visitors to live in community and provide space for rituals, classes, and our kirtan group that meets weekly for joyous group singing and spiritual chats. If you already occupy or own a property suitable for us, or if you have the resources to help us purchase a property, we can consider accelerating the process of your becoming a monk.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21687&quot;&gt;Safe Haven Ranch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Green Eco Families with Kids that would like to work together to create the lives we can only dream of on our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/safe-haven-ranch/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/safe-haven-ranch/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a small family (man, wife, &amp; 7yo son) looking to get out of the rat race and live a more natural, green, healthy, peaceful, stress free, and sustainable life in a small community of similar likeminded families. We were hit very hard by the outsourcing of IT jobs overseas and then after rebuilding our lives and only 8 months after our only child was born we got hit hard again by the onslaught of the corruption induced recession we all know as the Great Recession.

I rebuilt again, but this time the 18 hour days 7 days a week was at the expense of quality time with my child, my wife, my aging mother, my dying dad, and my friends, not to speak of the toll it took on my body and emotional wellbeing.  And after missing much of my child’s young life and most impressionable years, and all the other sacrifices my hard earned successes were all taken away again when a major corporate client went over budget on a major project and couldn’t or didn’t want to pay their bills in a timely manner causing us to become homeless because we couldn’t pay our bills.

So during this rollercoaster ride of life we realized that fighting the ways of the new and corrupt global economy to keep ourselves in the middleclass or even just surviving was a futile battle that was just keeping us enslaved in life that wasn’t healthy for us anyway.

So through this we realized that a good quality life is about family, healthy kids, friends, non-poisonous food, good nutrition, love, and a stress-free existence.   Additionally, having a young child on board we want to protect (not shelter) him from everything rotten in the world while preparing him for the worst and letting him decide for himself if he wants to fight for a happy successful future in the world we chose to leave.

During our battles to survive we have become very enlightened to what is really going on in this country and the world, and we see very clearly what is/has happened to the middleclass, the poor, our futures and the futures of our children.

We are not happy with the corporate and religious takeover of the United States of America, but there is so much more going on that most people don’t know about or realize, because if they did there would be massive rioting in the streets. Unfortunately, those that are willing to get their voices heard (even in a nonviolent manner) are scorned by those that are still hanging on and don’t realize the extent of the damage being done to us in this country. Our politicians have completely sold us out and down the river, and the mass media is all part of it, and has done a great job of shutting out the voices of those of us in need of assistance and change.

Our Children have to live in this world, and they will have to suffer for a long time to come if we don’t do something about immediately.  But for those of us who have already been beaten up and silenced the best thing that we can do is to create the best life possible for ourselves and our children, which is what this community is all about.

We are tired of eating bland, poisonous, genetically altered food and we are tired of having to decide whether to pay rent or buy fresh healthy food for ourselves and our child, and we want to grow our own.

Our dream and goal is to find some acreage in Southern California where our likeminded families can live in peace, health, and harmony and be self-sufficient, self-sustaining. 

We do have a strong sense of spirituality through a connection to Mother Nature and a strong belief in common decency, kindness with Karma being our guiding light, but we do not participate in any commercialized religion.

We feel that the Native American’s had it right in their lifestyle and connection to the earth but see no proof of a creator and we believe in the science of evolution.

I’m an X hired gun software developer/consultant to the Fortune 500, the US Government and many other businesses, and I used to make around 100k per year, but now my family and I live in an RV bouncing around Southern California trying to give our son the best life possible.

If you feel that you and your family (couples or single mom’s with children) are compatible with ours please contact us via FIC.

I look forward to hearing from.

Sincerely,
Jerry</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21688&quot;&gt;Serenity House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Serenity House aspires to create a healing community that is based on compassion and service to humanity using Non-Violent Communication, ancient yogic teachings and local indigenous healing practises.
We strive to be as self sufficient as possible and live in harmony with the earth and our neighbors, we grow our own food and share our healing wisdom with our local community so that they may thrive as well and distribute moringa as a way to sustain the health of all peoples and our own economic well being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/in-la-kesh/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/in-la-kesh/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Serenity House is located 12 km outside of Alto Paraiso, Goias, Brazil, near the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park.
The town (population: 7,000) is in the world’s most biologically rich savannah ecosystem, with scenery that simultaneously conjures the vast plains of Africa and the rippling mountains of Kauai. Scattered about are hundreds of waterfalls, many flowing into river pools that are warm enough to swim in and clean enough to drink from. The region’s geology also comes with the requisite mystical component: Just beneath the soil is the world’s largest crystal bed, allegedly so luminous that it’s visible from outer space. 

We have come together to manifest from the heart, creating abundance and ease by living together in connection and harmony with the earth, building sustainable adobe or bamboo homes and practicing permaculture and biodynamic gardening.
We use natural ancient medicinal healing practises and eat pranic alive whole foods. We have an amazing abundance of GMO free and organic food in the area we live in.
We come from different cultures and backgrounds and are sharing and growing in the healing arts and using the wisdom of indigenous &amp;amp; yogic cultures-see more information on our website www.yogaofbeauty.net
We have a vision of acquiring the land we are currently residing on, with the intention of it being held in community trust that is set up legally to protect all share holders, yet the land will not be owned by any one person, acknowledging that the land belongs to us all as a gift.
We have enough space to accommodate 4 families comfortably as well as host volunteers and there is room to expand the community if we desire. The land can be purchased for a collective buy in fee of $12,000 per family (please contact us directly for further details) we have very rich soil for growing food and trees and building structures with adobe or bamboo. 
All the water we drink and use is coming from a live spring in the mountain, we live steps away from two rivers that intersect that have very clean water. The community we live in is very small, friendly and safe, the weather is sub-tropical and the climate is pleasant all year long.
By practicing Consensus and Non-Violent Communication we aspire to grow in the challenges that arise from coming together out of domination based societies and finding new ways to live in harmony with one another through this shared living experience.
One of our collective projects is growing moringa, and we consistently are moving towards self sufficiency, barter, and other forms of exchange besides paper.
We have a process of becoming a guest first, getting to know one another for a period of 4 months and then deciding if a longer stay or integration into community is of benefit for all through consensus, we know that all people have valuable gifts to offer and we welcome you to come and share in this beautiful vision.

&quot;When you look into the eyes of another person, you are looking into your own eyes&quot;

&amp;amp; Permaculture Demo-farm

On a small Island south-west of Bohol in the Philippines we are establishing a Community based on spiritual aspects.
At the same time we do self sustaining farming and follow permaculture principles on a lot of almost 1'700 sqm.
The lot has around 7 different sections containing:

1. Entrance, Rest House with basement, workshop, open- and deep-well
2. Forest Garden with composting area, compost toilet, outdoor shower, Bird cage, water storage and grow beds
3. Shaded Labyrinth garden and sweat lodge
4. Japanese Pond Garden
5. Rocky pits with Meditation Hall base for Geodesic Dome
6. (Earth-House/future project) Ditch with recognizable cliff side
7. Rocky Coral hill with different plant varieties

A small rest house of native style gives us shelter from moody weather. The climate is tropical, sometimes rainy but mostly warm.
A Solar-Island-System provides us with electricity and a deep well pump ensures us plenty of water with the small disadvantage of salinity. 
The farm is located on mostly flat alvar terain, approx 10m above sea level and about 1km away from the sea cliffs. 

Our rest house can accommodate people in 3 small rooms.
Currently there are 4 people, 1 cat, 4 dogs, 1 rabbit, fish and a few chickens living at the Rainbow Farm.
We are still open for new members and volunteers;
People with skills and sencitivity towards the surrounding as spiritual guides and practicioners are most welcome.

Coming here is for most people, which are not used to Asia a bit of a culture shock.
We are trying ourselves to find the balance between the local culture, other species of plants and the cultural background we come from. Sometimes it's necessary to look at things with less expectations to manage daily challenges in communication with locals.
Anyhow, we just like you to know that we take our spiritual path very serious, practice unselfish love in meditation and in our daily action. We testing our limits for example with diets and fastenings. Sure there are slight adjustments for everybody’s health situation included, because one have to be ready for certain steps.
Basically we walk the talk, and not just signpost the path and let the others walk it… (Aquarian Gospel 15:15)

Co-Creators' Dream
Ke Aku’a Moe’uha’ne Kauha’le

The vision of Ke Aku’a Moe’uha’ne Kauha’le / The Creator Dream Settlement is to co-create a settlement of people using the creation story as told by Anastasia in book 4 as well as The Billionaire story in book 8.1 of the Ringing Cedars of Russia Series in the Western World. In the Ancient Hawaiian its understanding that the key to the future is learning the past through the Legend known as “The Children of the Rainbow”. The time before time was Heaven on Earth and the children of the most high Akua lived as though immortal without concern of food, clothing, shelter or disease.

The creator had a divine dream to create something greater than self. This dream started a conversation amongst all the diverse energies of the universe. They asked the creator, ‘What do you desire”? ‘Co-creation and joy for all from it’s contemplation’ was the answer.  At the creator’s request, all the diverse energies contributed a part of their energy to the dream. The creator harmonized all of these energies within itself. The creator became pregnantly powerful. With a harmonized balance of all these energies, inspired by love, the creator made the physical world. 

When love inspires two people to create a family together, a similar co-creation takes place. The diverse energies of the family are balanced and harmonized and the dream is manifested. 

We have a dream to create something greater than ourselves. We dream of co-creating  settlements balancing and harmonizing the diverse energies of the members of the settlement into a grand and beautifully loving physical creation. We envision supporting one another’s dream to co-create a space of love with our own love, physical contribution and those who have a desire to use their worldly resources to lift mankind into a place of enjoying “Heaven on Earth” in balance with themselves, the earth and all living things.

     The vision that follows is a co-creation of the members currently involved in Ke Aku’a Moe’uha’ne Kauha’le / The Creator Dream Settlement.  As other members are inspired to co-create with us, their input and energy will be balanced and harmonized with the existing group. As a result, our vision is living and changeable according to the energies that are present in the group and on the land. 

     We envision settlements nurtured and stewarded with love. There are spaces of love with trees, ponds, flowers, fruits and cozy shelters. Each of us is competent and self-sufficient in our ability to create. When a member asks for help with creating their space of love, we joyfully take part in the co-creation. 
     We see our group creating our settlement in or near the ocean and mountains. There are grassy meadows, diverse tree species, and a creek running through the land year round with a waterfall. At night we see only the lights of the cosmos, we hear only joyful sounds of nature and kin. 
    We generate our energy locally and sustainable. We are an integral part of creating our own shelters. We help each other when requested and are able. We are open to individuals getting outside help to create their shelters if they feel it is needed. We share resources such as vehicles and other large tools. There is a drivable road to the entrance of the property with a covered parking area. The use of vehicles throughout the settlement is minimized. We have a shared community space where common daily conveniences will be available such as communication systems, hand and electric tools, laundry, and guest quarters. We see nature as the primary teacher of our children. Children are precious and valued and are the inspiration for the live art we create with our spaces of love and to this end we aspire to Co-create life in a conscious and intentional manner as put forth so beautifully in Chapter 8 “I am giving birth to you, my angel! In book 8.1.

Friends Southwest Center is an intentional residential community on 64 acres of land in the very SE corner of Arizona, USA.  The community was founded by Quakers from Tucson 35 years ago and remains small but vital today.  The founding principles of non-violence, harmony, living gently on the earth, and consensus decision making still inform our daily life and business decisions. We have camping and rental options for travelers, small groups and interested seekers. We embrace and nurture diversity for those who want to live simply in peaceful high desert surroundings.
Some of us do &quot;guerrilla gardening&quot; as the extremes of climate and local critters take a toll on our gardens. There are several home greenhouses and a young orchard.
FSC hosts a weekly unprogrammed Quaker meeting year round. We have a Peace Park, and donate regularly to charity. We are LBGT and family friendly. We support activism in border issues and some members volunteer with ESL classes for people in Douglas and with art projects and food bank volunteering. We have contacts in Sonoran border towns in Mexico and in Hermosillo Mexico. We are located close to the Agua Prieta border crossing,Bisbee, Douglas and beautiful wildlife and natural areas like the Chiricahua National Monument. Our local airport is in big city Tucson, but our lifestyle is high desert sustainable.
It's very quiet in the summer, when the monsoon rains arrive. We often do not have enough members here to host summer visitors.

Currents community formed in the late 1970s as an outgrowth of our regional food co-op network. In 1981, we bought a 163-acre farm in the Appalachian hills of southeast Ohio near the progressive university town of Athens, a very supportive macro-community environment. We began community life together in the original farmhouse and another multi-family house that we built. Those houses are still the center of our community. Since then we have built 6 family homes, and the infrastructure and facilities to support a pleasant, meaningful life in a rural, multi-generational community. We are committed to creating a replicable model of joint land ownership and sustainability practices, grounded in cooperative principles and affordability.

Within that model, our original intention was to create a home base for members engaged in various forms of nonviolent social change activism. Changing times have impressed on us the need to incorporate an even stronger commitment to sustainability practices – or, “Earth justice” – as the necessary foundation for social justice. 

To that end, we are looking ahead to growing more food, developing a conscious relationship with our land and its potential, transitioning to renewable energy, and encouraging home-based economic enterprises. We welcome inquiries from energetic visionaries who would appreciate the stability of a long-established community, while also welcoming the challenge of co-creating with us a new, forward-thinking model of community life for the difficult times ahead.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21694&quot;&gt;Growing Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Growing Home is a vision of a beautiful and harmonious living situation where community members strive to live in tune with our Earth and each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/growing-home/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/growing-home/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&quot;Growing Home&quot; is a forming intentional community/co-op home in Portland OR or the surrounding area. There is no location as of yet, and many details are up in the air right now. If the following descriptions sings to you, please get in touch to help make this dream a reality.

Growing Home is a vision of a living/working/playing space in accordance with its members ideals, including: sustainability, creativity, spirituality, gardening, DIY, giving, hospitality, freedom, self-sufficiency, consensus decision making, and paradigm-shifting.

We cherish nature and seek to live in harmony with the Earth. Growing our own food will be a major part of this project. We envision a greenhouse (made of reclaimed materials) where we will grow all sorts of yummy, nurturing foods. Cooking and eating together is imperative. A big kitchen table topped with fresh, vegan meals will be a gathering space for us and our wider community. Ideally we will become as self-sufficient as possible and produce our own energy as well.

We embrace non-denominational, non-dogmatic spirituality to foster a connection between each other and the planet, galaxy, Universe which is our home.  Spiritual atheists are welcome as well. We may incorporate ritual as part of our daily lives.

Another major project will be the offering of hospitality.  Our home may have elements of a hostel, where weary travelers can stay and integrate with our community.  Guests can contribute with their energy and/or in other ways.

We also choose to embrace the intelligent use of technology (especially DIY and open-source technology!) for the benefit of all. We recognize technology as inherently neutral and choose to use it responsibly and with good intentions.

Creativity will be encouraged and space and time will be designated for playing music, creating art, and expressing ourselves however we chose.

We strive to improve ourselves, our lives, and our planet.  Openness to new ideas is essential. We will never stagnate nor become burnt out, but rather transform in a constant process of evolution. In this way, we will become catalysts for the new world!</description>

We are a young family (2 26 year olds with a 2 year old and 4 year old and one on the way) looking to connect with like-minded people. We hope to start a small community over the next few years with a system of unconditional love, support, and respect for all at its core. We want to reach out and help empower people to make changes in their lives along with building a support group for ourselves. We hope to inspire and directly help create new communities, and wish to better connect them to each other, furthering the web of support.

We are currently in the beginning stages of developing 40 acres in Dallas, Oregon with gardens, orchards and small shelters. We have started with close to an acre of vegetable production that we work by hand. We are planning on establishing a viable permaculture farm in the coming years to support the property and community. We also plan to add chickens for eggs, bees for honey and beeswax, and sheep for wool.

Female empowerment, especially through natural childbirth and midwifery is the other side of the vision. We believe that through real food and natural birth things can change. Children that are born peacefully into the world, raised with love, fed with food from the earth, and are instilled with values that make earth stewardship, cooperation, and hardwork priority will have the type of leadership, appreciation of the earth, and love for all that can make changes in the world.

We want to surround ourselves with open-minded freethinkers, who wish to actively work together in creating a better world for future generations. We are looking for people with experience or interests in natural building, permaculture, biodynamics, homesteading, renewable energy, as well as education/homeschooling (nature-based, waldorf-inspired, etc), natural parenting, midwifery, natural childbirth, organizing and outreach, and working towards living truly fulfilling/meaningful lives!

We are looking for driven individuals with different ideas for marketing, businesses, or projects branching from the farm to help support the property.  For example, growing and selling flowers, herbs and/or herbal products, and prepared vegetarian foods that can be sold at the markets that we are currently attending.  Along with adding those options to our forming CSA.  Other ideas might be to start a garden/farm/nature-centered, organic foods daycare program for the area.  Or Holding classes and events (natural building, gardening, cooking, yoga, self-sufficiency, etc) - We'd love to consider other ideas. 

Please contact us if you have any questions, would like more info, or want to develop an affiliation.

Our farm lies along a year-round creek and is mostly surrounded by National Forest. The farm is 1 hour drive to any size-able town (Corvallis). We raise sheep, milking goats, pigs, chickens, a milking cow and several beef cows. The garden is an acre of assorted vegetable crops, an additional acre of blueberries, along with raspberries, strawberries and the wild blackberries. We have one larger (30' X 90') and one smaller greenhouse on the property for season extension. We maintain irrigation rights to our creek and irrigate both pastures and gardens.   We grow our own fiber flax and process our sheep fleeces for spinning.  We speak English and Spanish. We eat a wide assortment of food from vegetarian to dairy to farm raised meat. Accommodations include indoor private space, shared bathroom and kitchen, wood heat.  Email for first contact and then we will schedule a follow up phone chat. No drop ins. We are not a large community and have very complicated schedules to juggle farm and off-farm income, so as much lead time as possible is best for planning a visit. We charge $40 per person/ per day for food and the time it takes for us to show you the land and spend several hours discussing the possibility of living together.

We are a working farm. Please be mindful of that and leave dogs at home during your visit. Please understand that as we grow most of our own milk, meat and veggies, there are times of the year when we may not have time to play host or show you around. Also, please do next expect to come here and &quot;hang out&quot; or be on vacation. 

At present we are actively looking for a couple or several single individuals who already have experience in rural living, community life and agricultural endeavors. We currently have open housing spaces available for the right person(s). As this is a very rural area, and we are not income sharing, the situation lends itself to people with an established internet-based part time job or those who pursue seasonal work elsewhere. We are NOT interested in folks seeking to grow cannabis here!</description>

We offer monthly 12 day shamanic ceremony retreats, with AYAHUASCA shamans and SAN PEDRO shamans. The retreats are at cost, non profit, and very transformational for all who come to them.

Gaia Sagrada Eco-Community &amp; Shamanic Retreat Center is nestled in the magical Andes Mountains near Cuenca, Ecuador. Gaia Sagrada is approximately 150 miles south of the equator, consists of 55 acres of pristine land with fresh clean mountain air, peaceful pastures, gardens, whispering pine forests and incredible views. Walks on various dirt roads offer breathtaking views of the mountains and sky. 

Live at Gaia Sagrada in your own private room (shared bath), shared room, or dormitory. Small apartments are on the way. 7 hrs/wk in the community is required to keep everything neat and clean, things that you would normally do to keep your own home in order. This helps us keep the prices low and at cost. We don't make money, but must break even. Everyone must chip in for chores and upkeeping the gardens.

Live at Gaia Sagrada affordably month to month, no lease or obligation, for 3 months per year as a tourist, or up to 6-9 months per year on an extended tourist visa in Ecuador. With residency in Ecuador, one could stay indefinitely.

Unfortunately we have no facilities or education for children, and there are none nearby. Only a poor, indigenous elementary school that only speaks and teaches in Spanish, no English. 

If you really like living at Gaia Sagrada and want to have your own small home, you can join with our Build It Forward program and have your own home. We require you rent for a little while first though, 6-12 months at least, and make sure Gaia Sagrada is a good fit for you. 

Residents can participate in retreats if they want to by paying the difference between the housing fees and the retreat price. The retreats vary between shamanic ceremonies with the Ayahuasca shamans and the San Pedro shamans, and we occasionally have yoga, weightloss and detox retreats between the shamanic retreats.

Life at Gaia Sagrada is a beautiful experience with a laid back lifestyle in a supportive and serene atmosphere with retreats with visitors coming every month. If you are coming for experiencing an eco-village community, you will find a beautiful model in action. You can also take day trips into Cuenca and enjoy the historic district where restaurants and activities abound.

We practice living in the moment, gaining self understanding, and living as gently on the earth as possible. We also have the goal of helping visitors with life changing and transformative shamanic retreats with the Ecuadorian traditional plant medicines. 

You will meet people you'll become friends with for life and live a beautiful adventure during this era of change and awakening of humanity in a truly safe place. 

If you are looking for the experience of a lifetime, this is the place to be! Gaia Sagrada is the only community of its kind in Ecuador and is the most advanced. You get so much more than just a place to live. You get a balanced lifestyle and you can blossom into your highest potential with others on the same journey.

We are an ecovillage living in strawbale houses and farmhouse as rentals. We garden, farm, have horses and chickens on 30 acres of mostly forested land in N. Idaho.
We have some openings from time to time, and the residents are here with a 30-day notice if they do not work out. We are currently building another strawbale cabin, harvesting food, riding horses, bio-dynamic gardening, off-grid living, composting and enjoying fall. We ski, wake board and learn about the Natural processes. We now have 11 folks here ages 10 to 65.

Fort Awesome is a micro intentional community.  Right now we exist in the form of a large three person apartment in Middletown, CT.  We hope to expand soon into the two other apartments located on the bottom floor of the three family house where we reside, and later to possibly purchase property.  Our home uses a highly structured environment in an attempt to create maximum efficiency with resources, excellent communication, and personal accountability.  Our values focus on environmental sustainability, consensus-based egalitarianism, non-traditional family structure, and the creation of a safe space.  Dan and Ari, the founding members, are queer-friendly, child-free, progressive, in our early 30's, geeky, largely freegan, academic, and we have a pet dove named Juniper.

PLEASE NOTE: The earliest we will be potentially seeking a new community member is Spring 2016, and our current third roommate has expressed an interest to stay here for a few years. We are unlikely to have vacancy in the interim. Please contact AriKubie if you're interested in scheduling a tour and interview.

Thanks!

&quot;I lived in this home for two years and was happy and comfortable from start to finish. The bedroom is spacious, well lit, and comfortable. There is ample storage space in the attic, and plenty of room in the kitchen and bathroom. Dan and Ari are fun, yet responsible, making them easy to live with. The apartment is large enough so you have a sense of privacy. It is not cramped. The house is clean and well-kept. The division of household chores is fair and clearly defined. I found it very easy to keep up with the simple chores and never felt burdened.&quot;

Most significantly we work to facilitate and inspire community building here locally and everywhere, because we are continually awed by the power and fun of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/dacha-project-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/dacha-project-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Dacha Project, founded in 2008, is a do-it-yourself, egalitarian and educational homestead. We are comprised of six friends and an extensive circle of supporters and community members. Situated on 16 acres in Finger Lakes region of New York, we have built an off-the-grid, earth-bermed, solar-passive house, powered by active solar and a diesel generator converted to run on waste vegetable oil. (We connected to the grid on 2014 but still use solar power) In addition, we built, or rather sculpted, a straw-bale cottage, planted a fruit and nut tree orchard, and are ever-expanding our gardens.  We are almost entirely owner built, with innovative designs for our energy, heating, water, waste and agriculture systems.  

We often invite the community in for tours, events and workshops. In the future we plan to expand our educational programming and more official artist/writing residencies, as well as internships and apprenticeships. Although, we are not looking for more permanent members at this time, any interested people are welcome to visit, to write us, to purpose projects, or to simply explore our website or keep up with us on Facebook  (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dacha-Project/72957687386?ref=hl).

Our overall aim is to live in conjunction with the land that supports us, to present alternatives to wasteful practices,  and to have ample time to follow various individual pursuits, be they micro-businesses, art, or anything else.  Most significantly we work to facilitate and inspire community building here locally and everywhere, because we are continually awed by the power and fun of collaboration.

    -family atmosphere
    -own farm where to learn practical skills
    -students may stay over summer holidays
    -support for low-income families
HOUSE OF PRAYER
    -Daily prayer and Christian lifestyle
    -Denominational cooperation (Ecumenism)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kristian-david-school/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kristian-david-school/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
We are an intentional community in Latvia and we run a state accredited primary boarding school since 1991. We have 35 children in school and about 15 community members/educators, most of whom live full time in community and receive no salary for their work. We have an organic farm and fields, which provide our school with almost all necessary foodstuffs. Children work side by side with teachers on the fields, with animals, also in the kitchen baking pastries, engaging in culinary experiments etc. Some of the pupils are  orphans who have become foster children of our community members and are being cared for till their adulthood and beyond. We try to teach them christian values, open-mindedness, creativity, empathy and compassion. We get immense joy from growing in mind and in spirit together. Our classes are small, children get individual attention and help whenever it's needed. We play music with our brass band which takes part in music festivals. We sing and pray together every day. Our music teacher composes music for school theatre and our art teacher also runs an art studio in the town. We try to cultivate the culture of cooperation and mutual aid amongst ourselves. School's family-like environment gives children opportunity to acquire various practical skills. They can learn to take care of the animals, ride a horse or a pony, grow vegetables and fruit, do some light household DIY and acquire some technical skills in the garage. The result is confident, self-reliant, multifaceted human being whose both mental and physical capacities are developed. We have friends from other countries who help us financially, materially and through regular visitations create a paradoxically international environment in the middle of sparsely populated Latvian countryside. We are always happy to make new friends. Contact us at jekabss@gmail.com

We'd like to build a community or group of friends, perhaps some of whom live on our property, and some of whom live nearby. Our idea of &quot;Friends of Anima Journey&quot; means just that: we want to broaden our base of friends of like-minded people and improve the world a little piece at a time!
We are especially interested in libertarian-minded, freedom-minded, civil liberties-minded individuals who do not follow the mainstream 'sheeple' mentality. Any lawyers, accountants, doctors, or paper-work gurus who would love to be part of making the World of Tomorrow Happen Today would be very welcome!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/anima-journey/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/anima-journey/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Come check out AnimAJourney where the World of Tomorrow Starts Today! AnimAJourney is located in a rural small subdivision. We are part of a neighborhood (small subdivision) of some like-minded neighbors who are interested in a similar lifestyle and similar values. AnimAJourney is currently two adults who have been living a life of voluntary simplicity in many ways: P.V. solar, composting, organic/veganic gardening and orcharding, building with concrete [building for 200 to 400 years, fireproof, sounds are very moderated, termite-proof], mostly live (raw) vegan foods, solar cart [a PV electric golf cart that we use for portable electricity], 'green' and 'sustainable' [we know those terms are sometimes difficult to define, and people have differing perspectives on them] and integrated living. We are not perfect, but doing our best! One of our neighbors is EarthReleaf, another 'sustainable' property. Most of our neighbors, for example, get their electricity with P.V. solar, and live fairly quiet lives. Some have been activists [such as keeping electrical poles from being installed]. We have regular fun activities, and plan to incorporate more. We'd like to have people come stay with us in our groovy &amp; beautiful cabins [or camping] who are interested in friendship, short-term or long-term stays, WWOOFing, internships, and possibly checking out the neighborhood for living here. We see ourselves as a grain of sand in the beach of the evolutionary transformation in the world! Come learn from us, share your knowledge, and perhaps stay a while! We love live foods because they love us back! We strive for harmonious living using Miguel Ruiz's &quot;Four Agreements&quot; and &quot;The Five Agreements&quot;, among other things, so if you haven't read Ruiz's books, we recommend them! We want to draw people here who are of like mind, of course. We especially are interested in connecting/hanging with those who are fascinated in exploring the psychosocial frontier! Maybe take a vow of levity? :) The World of Tomorrow is Today at AnimAJourney!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21707&quot;&gt;Belterra Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Belterra Mission Statement: To create and sustain an evolving community that embraces respect for a diverse group of ecologically accountable and socially responsible people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/belterra-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/belterra-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Belterra Cohousing is a multi-generational community with 30 condominium-styled homes in 5 residential buildings on a forested hillside overlooking beautiful Howe Sound and the Coast Mountains of British Columbia. We are located on Bowen Island, just 40 minutes from downtown Vancouver. 

As of July 2015, we reached our goal of 30 households and had all moved in. Our vision of sustainable island living has captured the imagination of a diverse group of people, from 10-year-old Josie to retired UBC professor Paul. From the U.S. and across Canada, we have found this lovely island with a thriving arts community, small scale agriculture, active outdoor lifestyle  and a variety of spiritual practices. 

Belterra is a community within a community. Bowen Island has a small-town feel, an interesting history as a vacation spot popular in the early 1900s, and a continues to attract summer visitors to its two primary commercial centres with cafes, grocery stores, restaurants, fine crafts shops, galleries, and retreat centres.

If you visit the Belterra Cohousing Website, you can learn more about the talents and interests of many of our members under “Who We Are” and find out if we have listed any rentals or homes for sale. The website includes renderings of the buildings that grace our 10 acres with 30 energy-efficient homes http://www.belterracohousing.ca

At meetings, we find ourselves laughing a lot and enjoying the process of designing a community that includes community gardens, a 3,300 sf common house, greenhouse, workshop and children's play areas. We also have fantastic potluck meals, with a range of diets represented. We enjoy cooking and meal sharing and grow lots of vegetables in the summer months.

The homes and other facilities are certified BUILT GREEN® Gold and have in-floor radiant heat and water catchment. Each household may have up to &quot;eight legs&quot; for pets - that is two dogs, two cats, or one of each. We have adopted policies that govern smoking, fencing, and parking that were developed to respect both individuals and the group.

We are free to rent out our homes, but are a stable residential community and nearly all &quot;owners&quot; live at Belterra year-round and participate in the process of creating community.

Among us you will find: nurses, wood workers, teachers, musicians, techies, fine artists, therapists, social workers, body workers, doctors, seekers, gardeners, students, environmental consultants, editors, small business owners, builders, a yoga instructor, a financial analyst, a certified ecologist, an RCMP officer, a researcher, a graphic artist, a pharmacist and a librarian. We have young children and retirees, and several ethnic groups are represented. 

You can find us on Facebook.</description>

An  environmentally and socially responsible, sustainable cohousing community.  Our irrigated 1+  acre infill community is in Albuquerque's North Valley, next door to La Montanita food coop. 
Our homes are small--800 to 1200 sq. ft. and are highly energy efficient. There are 10 homes including the original farmhouse, part of which is our community space and guest suite. New homes are clustered around a courtyard, parking is in carport row near our large community garden. All owners are members with one vote per owner,  and all work in committees to organize activities, manage and maintain the community. Decision-making is modified consensus--- Dynamic Governance. Our focus has been on having a thoughtfully designed, supportive community of singles and partners who will thrive in a nurturing, diverse and inspiring community. We aim to live more lightly on the land and welcome active adults who share those values.

We seek a life of prayer, humility, simplicity, and voluntary poverty alongside the poor. Committed to the Catholic Worker movement, founded in 1933 by Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day, we advocate for personalism, a decentralized society, and a green revolution through nonviolence, the works of mercy, manual labor, and voluntary poverty. Eight permanent residents currently live in our Catholic Worker farm house, and our Christ Room is available nightly for temporary guests. Funds and donations are directly used for the performance of the corporeal and spiritual works of mercy, and no one in the House draws any compensation from contributions.</description>

We produce all of our own electricity and plan to heat our buildings using wood burning stoves and fireplaces , and we are in the process of establishing a garden , orchards , and vineyard where we will grow all of the vegetables we need for our own consumption , sale , and bartering.

Buildings are being constructed to achieve virtual 100% efficient use of energy (i.e. R40+ insulation in walls and roof).

All water used for drinking , household use , livestock , irrigation , and fire suppression is harvested from rainwater runoff and stored in large , elevated , above ground storage tanks.

Gardens , fruit orchards , vineyards , wild hog traps , and a variety of animals and poultry will be used to minimize the impact of runaway food prices and predicted future shortages.

Plans are underway and scheduled to implement a substantial number of diverse revenue generation projects with all residents sharing in the proceeds of these ventures , including the establishment of a &quot;Guest Ranch&quot; , and a &quot;Safe House&quot; that will include such activities as wild hog hunting &amp;amp; trapping , daily horse riding , ATV rides , fishing , cook-outs , hiking trails , farm chores , etc.

Excess food production will be donated to needy causes , sold , fed to livestock , and bartered for various goods and services from our neighbors.

We are in constant contact with the rest of the world using high speed internet access and mobile phones , while taking maximum advantage of our quiet , clean , and beautiful rural setting.

We make extensive use of the latest technology and products available to optimize our efficiency , comfort , and effectiveness.

Our members attend the churches of their choice throughout the surrounding community on an optional regular weekly basis , they participate in their favorite community service activities on a regular monthly basis , and they take part in other community activities as well - to ensure we remain an integral , valued , and welcome member of the surrounding communties.

In summary , we maximize our self-sufficiency and survivability while taking full advantage of what modern technology , materials , and the internet offers - while enjoying the many benefits , advantages and freedoms of our rural environment.</description>

White Pine Cohousing is a six unit community on 41 acres of meadow and forest land located in rural central Vermont, just outside of Montpelier. The houses are clustered on the south side of the seven acre meadow to enhance solar exposure and maintain the open fields for gardens, wildlife and activities. We aim to create and maintain a residential community that both respects individual needs and expects member participation in managing the social and physical requirements of the community. We have village-like informal connections and use a consensus decision-making process. Our individually owned homes were built with environmentally sound construction, are super insulated, share a common heating system and have small ecological footprints.

Villagers will live in privately owned homes, and enjoy the benefits of a large common area jointly managed to enhance physical and social resilience. 

Atamai is specifically designed to deal with the impacts of climate change, energy descent and the economic and social challenges that are likely to follow.

The development of our ecovillage is well underway. We have a dozen families on site, living in interesting eco-homes. Our common land has been developed into orchards, grazing, market gardening and forestry. We will eventually be quite large, about 50 homes, and so we are still actively developing these titles. We currently have lots of various prices and sizes for sale.

We are located within biking distance of Motueka, on the top of NZ's South Island, and less and an hour's drive from Nelson and Richmond.</description>

Aldeas de Paz (ADP) is a sustainable NGO based in Santa Barbara de Samana, the dominican republic. ADP is independent from political, religious or business interests and maintains independence by completely funding and operating its programs with the practical and monetary contributions of volunteers. The community promotes the &quot;Culture of Peace&quot; through enriching cross-cultural exchange for people of all races and nationalities and practices voluntary community service where it provides additional opportunities in educational, recreational and environmental fields and assists its beneficiaries to develop their potential and improve their own lives. ADP Volunteer opportunities are truly the microcosm of a world where people join together giving priority to improving life for humanity and promoting a &quot;Culture of Peace&quot; as a practical way to both prevent and resolve conflict. Volunteers and interns are the driving force of our charity, both through their volunteering and through their financial contributions. A typical volunteer/intern needs to be enthusiastic, willing to learn, ready for a challenge, has a desire to take initiative and dedicates a lot of caring and passion to the position. Friendliness, care, commitment and patience are among important qualities. We welcome individual volunteers, families and groups regardless of age, experience or background. Volunteering with ADP is a great opportunity to work side by side with locals, learn new skills, study Spanish, and immerse oneself in the Latin and indigenous culture. You are interacting with the community, building relationships and making a positive impact.

    The focus of community is the development of an attractive sustainable, repeatable, Eco-Village Business model to replace 75-80 percent of the &quot;external economy&quot; with an &quot;internal economy&quot; meeting the housing, energy, food, entertainment, and transportation needs of a population of approximately 80 individuals. 
    The plan is for a dedicated team of about twenty highly skilled farmers, cooks, builders and support staff to be committed to offering a &quot;product&quot; to about 60 renter customers called &quot;Quality of Life&quot; or more appropriately &quot;Quality of Experience&quot;.  That team over time become equity partners in the enterprise which is organized as a perpetual corporate institution and upon their &quot;retirement&quot; essentially sell their ownership to their replacement.  
    The plan is to offer an experience similar to living in a small village in the south of France.  Anyone who has spent time in Provence knows that this is perhaps the highest quality of life anywhere on the planet.  
The &quot;mission&quot; of this team is to compete with the Archer Daniel Midlands, Monsantos, and other multinationals and to create such an attractive economically viable, and essentially &quot;kick their asses&quot;! 
The Village provides a lease on demand automobile fleet, meets most of their energy needs through solar and passive house design principles.  The Village functions almost as an all inclusive resort for the renters who may work from home or hold conventional jobs.  The Village has support staff for laundry, cleaning, and personal services such as shipping and office services as well as picking up items from local stores.  There is a state of the art movie theater and library of books and dvds as well as access to a 2,400 square foot shop equipped for woodworking, metalworking and the latest CNC equipment.  
   The farming staff uses a mix of the latest and most appropriate farming methodologies including permaculture, aquaponics and the grass based methods of Salatin as well as conventional organic farming.  The farming focus is on Sustenance farming for the internal community as opposed to commercial farming.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21716&quot;&gt;Richmond Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The mission of Richmond Cohousing is to create an intentional multi-generational community of households who are good neighbors and conscientious environmental stewards.

Living in close proximity and sharing resources, we increase quality of life by caring for one another, celebrating together, reducing consumption, decreasing our impact on the environment, and offering Richmond a new model of vibrant neighborhood design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/richmond-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/richmond-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Richmond Cohousing is working with a developer to build a multi-generational, urban cohousing community in Richmond, Virginia. The developer owns the land and plans are with the city for approval with anticipated groundbreaking this spring and move-in late 2019. All you need to bring is a deposit, mortgage, and a covered dish!

Our condo-style building will have 19 single-level one-, two- and three-bedroom units on four floors with anticipated prices ranging from $185k to $365k. Common spaces include a large first floor area featuring a kitchen, dining/meeting area, and kids’ play room, a storage area, and a 2000 square foot rooftop deck with views of downtown. We plan to have multiple weekly shared meals and a collaborative rooftop garden. Site and unit designs are still being fine-tuned but some unit-types are going fast. Commitments from prospective buyers are encouraged by November 2018 with construction slated to begin Spring 2019. 

Our site is in the Manchester neighborhood of Richmond. This historic area is just over the James River from downtown and walkable or bikable to many attractive features including a library, restaurants (and two breweries!), shops, playgrounds and pocket parks, a large farmer’s market, and outdoor activities at the river. Public transit and bike lines are expanding throughout the area.

Richmond is located in the heart of Virginia and is one of America’s oldest cities. Our site in the state’s capital, just east of the Blue Ridge Mountains, is a two-hour drive from both Washington DC and the Tidewater region. Richmond has the benefits of both a major metropolitan area and small historic city with amenities, charm, and convenience. The city provides residents with a diverse employment, social, and community opportunities.

Richmond Cohousing has been active for a number of years. We’ve sung, biked, played games, and volunteered together. We’ve eaten delicious community dinners in each other’s homes. We’ve drafted agreements that assert the way we want to live together as a community. We’ve honed our meeting format to a fast-paced, no-nonsense structure. And we’ve laughed - a lot. Through it all, we’ve become a genuine community and are excited for others to join us with their own perspectives and personalities. Richmond Cohousing is looking to attract a diverse membership and welcomes singles, couples, families, and those wanting to age in place. There's still time to make your mark on the community by helping us affirm our values, finalize our designs, and create new community traditions.

***Update: We don't currently have any space available but are working on some exciting developments with other IC's and landowners in Colorado. Send us your email if you'd like to be updated when something comes available. 

A fun-loving and creative community of like-minded individuals who have all independently arrived at many of the same understandings of how important environment &amp; community is to be a healthy &amp; happy human being. Needless to say, commonplace modern society has not recognized nor embraced these fundamental principles. Instead it relies on default mechanisms &amp; serves the interests of select political &amp; economic powers, not the health &amp; success of each citizen nor our species as a whole. Simply put, we believe we can intentionally choose to do better -and we are. 

Our physical location at 8000 feet overlooks both Denver and Colorado Springs while still providing a quiet and peaceful setting to take-in and connect with nature.  

   It has become apparent to us that the awareness and embracing of Intentional Communities is likely the single greatest tool we have to ensure the success of both ourselves today and the future of humanity. It is the only apparent viable solution to replace the inherently flawed and deeply troubled political and economic systems that are being self-perpetuated without regard to nature, common sense, scientific findings, psychological &amp; health  implications and the will of the citizens. 

 There are many ideologies. movements and organizations from which we each draw our understanding &amp; inspiration. The following are just a few &amp; each one represents a wealth of information, as you know if you are familiar with them. If not, we would encourage you to research them to see if you can identify with the life changing and problem solving wisdom presented.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21718&quot;&gt;Serenity Gardens Eco Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; off grid simple lifestyle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/serenity-gardens-eco-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/serenity-gardens-eco-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Serenity Gardens Eco Village is an idea whose time has come. This 234 acre parcel of land in the mountains overlooking the Pacific Ocean above the town of Coronado will have 130 homes. Each house will be of simple, sustainable materials and with ample land to grow food that the community will share. The permitting process is underway as well as topography work to determine all of the home sites. A portion of the land has incredible ocean views and will be used as a community area so that all can enjoy it.  

There are three streams that flow through the property. One in particular has significant flow and elevation drop to support several hydro-electric turbines to power the community and supply water to the homes and common areas. Homes will be built with solar panels and be equipped with energy efficient led lighting throughout. Studies will be conducted on whether or not there is enough wind to generate electricity as well. 

Serenity Gardens is a &quot;sister&quot; project to Osa Mountain Village Resort which is approximately 10 minutes south in the same mountain range. Homes in Serenity Gardens will cost approximately $75,000 for a small 2 bedroom. If you are interested please call 818-561-5602 to be put on our email list to receive more information.

We also have three extra lots for growing food, play, and experiments in urban homesteading.

Currently, we are more of a family home than ic and are primarily building community as a venue for local music, potlucks, and other events. We are taking an extended break from life as an intentional community, but are open to the possibility of new people moving here after a time of getting to know them. In other words, it would probably need to be someone local.</description>

This is a new tribe trying to get established on 9 acres of woodland and a grass meadow in south central Oregon.

The land is already being purchased but we are not currently living here. It will be a summer only camp until better accommodations can be built. It may be some time before this can be finished due to lack of funds. Check back in the future for updates.

It borders the 2 million acre Fremont National Forest with many trails and wildlife.

The object of this community is to live together in harmony and be self sufficient off the grid.

Anyone wanting to join the tribe will first have to visit and make sure that it will work for everyone involved.

We lived in community with between two and seven other people for seven years.  We love wild harvesting and camping, and we also have large gardens and dairy goats!

We are still wishing to live in community with others, at our home base, and while wild-harvesting and camping. Our homespace includes several handbuilt cabins, several garden plots, dairy goats in pasture, and adjacency to wild public land. Our main harvests are: sugarbush, leeks, medicinal herbs, sucker fish run, garden, berries, hazelnuts, apples, wild rice, deer hunting, and snaring hares.  We are definitely a family (kids aged 13, 8 and 2), and are most interested in people with children joining us. We also run a summer camp for our friends, and would welcome adults who would be interested in participating in that!

Our home is in the midst of state forest and state park land; wilderness abounds!  Local communities include Finland, which is small, friendly and open-minded, and Grand Marais, which is a bit bigger, artistic and also friendly; it has a food co-op.  The blooming Long Haul Community is down the road four miles...

We will consider any time period length of visit from anyone. We would like to especially invite a person or people with one or more children to consider staying seasonally, over the summer/harvest time, as a good match for our space and life rhythms. Just contact us to get acquainted with possibilities!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21723&quot;&gt;Pleasant Glade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our goal is to strike a balance between individual and community living, promote organic gardening, adhere to the principles of permaculture, recycle, reuse and live light on the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/pleasant-glade/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/pleasant-glade/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Pleasant Glade is an Intentional Community looking to add to its core group.  Our community is designed to appeal to a diverse group of people who wish to live in a green community dedicated to sustainable living in a small town.
We are building a six-home community on 4.25 acres in the town of Tonasket in Northcentral Washington State.  All of the highly efficient earth sheltered homes are being pre-built to &quot;green&quot; building standards.  Each home will have an attached garage plus additional garage/storage space in the Community Building.  The Community Building is also equipped to house occasional guests and  contains a commercial kitchen, workshops, library, work area, ADA bathrooms, greenhouse, large meeting room, and dining area.  Each member/family will own their own home and lot and will share privileges with other members on the remaining common ground (nearly 3 acres) and the community buildings.  All members  will share the cost of stewardship (taxes, insurance, maintenance etc) on the common areas.  
The property has dedicated irrigation water which will be used to establish the permaculture landscape that will provide a large part of our food.  We are located in an excellent agricultural area just 20 miles south of the Canadian border.    
Most of the infrastructure; water, power, phone, internet and sewer was installed in 2011 and is in place to each lot.  As of this writing (1-12-2016) the community building is finished, two living units are completed and occupied and the landscaping is in.  We have begun construction on the next two living units and they should be completed next spring.
Our site is walking distance to shopping, schools, hospital, clinics, farmers market, library, and parks.  Tonasket is a vibrant town of about 1000 citizens with very diverse lifestyles.  It is the home of a long-standing food co-op and a cultural center dedicated to presenting healthy alternative programs, entertainment, and educational opportunities that benefit the entire community.  Our medical community is outstanding and the hospital in Tonasket has an authorized Veterans Clinic, and an extended care facility.  
It is our hope that, as an Intentional Community, we will be able to strike a balance between individual and community living, promote organic gardening, adhere to the principles of pemaculture, recycle, reuse, and live light on the land.   Pleasant Glade members will belong to an association which will be the governing body and use consensus for decision making to establish rules and guidlines for The Community.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21725&quot;&gt;Smart Progressives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; low-tech anarcho-socialists/ Caring individuals with an open mind who use technology responsibly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/smart-progressives/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/smart-progressives/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We can be described at &quot;low-tech anarcho-socialists&quot;, but a better description of us would be &quot;Caring and open minded individuals who use technology responsibly&quot;. We try to limit our exposure to EMFs, particularly the microwave frequency ones from devices such as cell phones and Wi-Fi. We live by the principle of &quot;Live as you want. Harm none.&quot; We aim to include a wide variety of people in our community encompassing different lifestyle choices, religions, and even political views. We are going to accept all of them as full individuals of the community and not ostracize them or condemn their actions so long as what they are doing is not harmful to others. Lastly, we are social. Though we all have our personal lives and our own sources of income, we also enjoy being with others in the community and are mindful of their needs and willing to be there for them when needed.

Everyone is welcome in our community, but there are two groups we are especially looking at attracting. The first one of these is electrosensitives, as well as those who are MCS/IEI. We feel this is important, as I am electrosensitive myself and as far as I know there are no other currently existing EHS-friendly intentional communities that are connected to the grid. Though we will be connected to the grid, none of our buildings will have smart meters. Also, our property will be at least half a mile, preferably one mile, from the nearest existing or planned cell tower. Though individuals will be allowed to use cell phones and Wi-Fi in their own homes ( completely banning them would be unrealistic in today's society and would excessively infringe on personal rights), they will not be allowed in the common areas or during group activities. The common house will have a couple of low-EMF computers with a wired connection as well as Internet jacks providing wired connections to laptops and other compatible devices.

The other group if families with older children and teenagers. When intentional communities accept families, they tend to focus on ones with younger children, as they are going to be raised from birth or nearly from birth in the community. Though that is a good idea, and we will be open to some families with younger children, in many of these communities the children leave once they pass the &quot;little kid&quot; stage and the community thus becomes too much of a little kid-centered place. Teenagers and older children, on the other hand, would have more of an understanding of our community and our ethics and will be better able to have intellectual conversations with the adult members and participate in our activities. We also aim to foster quality connections between youth and adults, which is something that is unfortunately lacking in our society.

Our property will have a common house which will be open to all members of the community. Dinners will be held there on a regular basis and we will also regularly have game nights and other events. The community will also have an organic farm. Housing will consist of a wide range that will include individual homes as well as apartments. For electrosensitives living in multi-unit buildings, there will be at least one EHS-friendly building where cell phone and Wi-Fi use will be restricted. Some members may need to, for whatever reason, live off site. They will be accepted as full members of our community (with the possible exception of some voting privileges) so long as they are able to participate in our events.</description>

      <name>Kentucky Tiny House Builder Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21726&quot;&gt;Kentucky Tiny House Builder Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To provide a place where people can build their own tiny house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/graysonohio-county-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/graysonohio-county-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Currently in the design phase of a place for folks to build their own tiny house, regardless of ability to pay for supplies or basic necessities (namely, food and shelter).  It would be a temporary residence while you build your tiny house.

Builders would contribute time to basic upkeep of community living, as well as actual building.  

Ideally, several core people would live on-site, or nearby, who would possess the skills to help people build.  There are some large buildings on the property, but the physical infrastructure needs a solid use plan.  Additionally, the plan should make the community solvent, so that it can handle assisting people with no way to fund their own house.

At this time, we are looking for people to assist with (or take over) setting up and planning.  My family and I live in a house on the land.  

If you would like to be added to the list of folks wanting to build a tiny house, feel free to contact us, but note that we do not yet have an anticipated start date.

After we begin building, we will probably be looking to also establish a tiny house community in the area.</description>

      <name>The Ardens</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21727&quot;&gt;The Ardens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Historic Village&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-ardens/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-ardens/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Ardens are three historic communities in Northern Delaware, about a mile from the Pennsylvania state line. The original village, Arden, was founded in 1900, as a land trust based on Henry George's Single Tax principles, and inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement and the land use policies of the Garden Cities movement.
From these earliest beginnings, it has flourished as a haven for artists and dreamers of all kinds, adding the villages of Ardentown (1922), and Ardencroft (1950).  Each generation of residents has contributed to a vibrant artistic and community venue, where the arts are considered a birthright of everyone. Although the villages are independent governments, the community functions as a whole.
Important community organizations include the Arden Club, which has activity gilds ranging from Folk Dance to Swim to the Scholar's Gild, and which sponsors an annual fair, the Saturday of Labor Day weekend, showcasing community talents and fundraising to support the converted barn that houses the club. The Dinner Gild operates a community dinner every Saturday during the winter, and various performance gilds continue the traditions of theatre and music, particularly Gilbert and Sullivan and Shakespeare, that have been with the town since its inception.  The Arden Community Recreation Association, or ACRA, sponsors events throughout the year, from a community camp to holiday parties and a house and garden tour.
Famous present and former residents include artists, performers and political activists far too numerous to mention, but Arden has been a home to political activists Mother Bloor, founder of the US Communist party, Upton Sinclair, and Scott Nearing,  to artists who have included Edward Loper and Rick Rothrock, as well as to performing artists including dancer Bea Bell, actress Barbara BelGeddes and actor Tony Perkins.
To live in the Ardens only requires finding a place to do so, and, while most of the housing is single-family owner-occupied, there are rental properties. If you purchase a house you purchase the house, only, all land is held in trusts and assessed according to Georgist principles. However, participating in the community does not require residence... membership in the Arden Club is open to all for a nominal membership fee. Other than artist studios and theatres there is little or no commercial development, but as the villages are now surrounded by suburbs, many residents commute to work or school in Wilimington or Philadelphia.

The villages are listed on the National Historic Register for their utopian vision and community organization, but no vision of utopia is achieved without struggle. Well into our second century, we continue to work together to try to solve the issues of justice and economic parity that concerned our founders, striving to balance the expectations of residents both longtime and new-come, without reenacting the power relationships of the larger society. As the surrounding area has changed, the challenges of this have changed as well, but as long as we commit to the process, we can still lay claim to our history.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21728&quot;&gt;RainSong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are building a new way of living, full of play, creativity, nature, and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/rainsong-village-home/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/rainsong-village-home/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;RainSong is a small intentional community located in the thickly wooded foothills of the Cascade Mountains about 45 minutes east of Seattle.  We have a comfortable rustic house with many bedrooms, wild edibles, tall trees and a salmon bearing creek singing along one border.  

We are building a new way of living, full of play, creativity, nature, and love.  Informed by the work of Charles Eisenstein and Jon Young (8 Shields), we are creating &quot;the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible,&quot;  a place we all belong, where we are each honored and connected. 

We are passionate about our food, and strive to choose organic (or better!) ingredients as much as possible.  We include both (local) meat eaters and vegetarians, and create both traditional foods (raw milk, kefir, kompucha, kimchee, coconut oil and healthy fats, organ meats, bone-broth soup) and brand-new receipes.  

We are fascinated by permaculture, primitive skills, non-violent communication (NVC), and alternative paradigms. We are passionate unschoolers, letting our children (and our adults!) choose their own paths and learn from their community and mentors. 

We like to cook together, eat together, work and play together.  We value privacy, and each adult or family has their own bedroom, but we greatly enjoy the community of sharing our common spaces together, and socializing, and learning from each other. While we value long term members, we also know that life is change, and we usually have a couple room openings every year.  

We often host community gatherings, so please email if you'd like to come visit us.  Please tell us about yourself when you do: what you are passionate about, what you want to do, what cool stories you might share!

We are part of Barefoot Village, a collection of local individuals and families. Barefoot Village gathers throughout the seasons to celebrate connection, share our gifts, and belong to a supportive community.</description>

We aim to relinquish non consensual power hierarchies created from our societal influences and build off of each other’s experience and background to better the earth, the cooperative and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/r-o-o-t-s/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/r-o-o-t-s/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Roots Cooperative

We are one of the 8 community cooperative here in Austin Texas. Our focus is on environmental sustainability and community building. We are governed through consensus process and highly value communication. Roots was founded by 10 activists out of the Occupy movement and takes a strong political and social stance for equality by gaining awareness of societal generated oppression and creating a new standard for non-hierarchical relationships.

We have a few raised bed gardens, a hugelmound, wicking beds and an aquaponics system. Cats, dogs, people, chickens and the occasional guinea fowl and turkey live here. We are renters who all have different hopes and dreams. Some of us wish to acquire land and some wish to integrate into other types of societies, cultures and cooperatives. Our current goal is to open up the passions of each other with the freedom of expression and allow each individual to blossom while creating a stronger blueprint of how a coop should walk and talk.

If you are interested in helping and are OK with primitive camping with facilities on-site, do get in contact with us because we would love the help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Bringing the intentional village and Primal skills together in one place for exceptional living and thriving in health, attitude, relationships and economy.

The primal Village will be an Intentional Community comprised of individuals and families who's main goal in life is to live life without depending on the rest of the world for survival or existence, who are aware and accepting of Polyamory (you don't need or have to be Polyamorous).

You will find that most of these people will be trying to live the four R's (Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). The reasons will be varied, some may live this life style because it is cost effective, others for the Planet, etc.

Members will most generally be interested in Alternative Energy production, Eliminating GMO foods from their diet, growing their own food (Wild Edibles, vegetables, meat, fruit), building their own Natural (locally obtainable natural resources) buildings/homes and many more similar ideas and lifestyles that result in not needing to buy anything.

If you are or know someone that might be interested in helping out with the formation and implementation of this project (planning, strategy, building, etc.), contact me.

We envision a world without oppression or hierarchy, where power is shared equally, and where all life is treated with dignity. We work to create this future by building housing alternatives that are equally accessible to all and that encourages the exploration of what it means to live in a beloved community. Our goal as a household is to create a cooperative and supportive home, where house members can develop, create and become whatever they desire in their self, alongside others and in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/la-casa-de-hueso/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/la-casa-de-hueso/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our home is a large two-story house (plus a very large basement) with 6 bedrooms (2 more in the basement), a large living room and dinning room, and kitchen. We have a large covered backspace (which is convenient for the rainy Olympia weather), a back garden space (that is used mostly for our grazing chickens), and a large front garden space (the chickens aren’t allowed here on account that they keep eating our sprouts!). We also have a large garage used for bike storage, maintenance projects, and roof access. We are all currently renters and do not own the space (something that we would love to change one day!).

We are located on the beautiful west side of Olympia. The house is in walking distance from down town and the west side Olympia Food Co-op and a short distance from The Evergreen State College. On clear days we even have a view of Mount Rainer from our top floor.

Our community consists of artists, activists, musicians, poets, workers, environmentalists, students, radicals, lovers, dreamers, and adventurers.</description>

      <name>New Oasis For Life ( Lifechanyuan China 2)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21735&quot;&gt;New Oasis For Life ( Lifechanyuan China 2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; A. New Universal Values
In our community, we have a harmonious relationship between people and nature. Everyone enjoy a simple and happy life here, the instances of crimes and fights are zero. Arguments, quarrels, and conflicts are very rare.

This is because of the solid basis of the universal values we had built before the community was established. It was initiated and written by the founder Xuefeng, and since 2001, he has written more than 2500 articles with over 10 million words in Chinese. Before participating in setting up the community, all members are first resonating with the values, include the dream of creating a sustainable new life mode beyond the limits of countries, nationalities, religions, and races; and bringing people real happy, free, joyful, and blessed lives.

So this values system and the common dream are the deep roots and energy source that motivates all members of the New Oasis for Life under all circumstances.

The content of this Universal Values includes the origin of the universe, the origin of LIFE, the origin of human beings on earth, time, space, consciousness, the value, meaning and purpose of life and LIFE; the crises human beings are faced with, the nature of countries, political parties, religions, marriage and family; the non-material world, and the way of beautifying one’s soul garden etc. It absorbs the wonderful wisdoms of human history such as those of Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Muhammad, and all wisdom essences of sages and saints from different civilizations and cultures.


B. New Life Mode

We have created a new production and life mode. We share the income 100%, all resources are shared, everything belongs to the community, and there is no private property any more.  Living, shelter, eating, clothes, transportation, aging, sickness, and death are all communal responsibilities, including nursing the elderly and educating the children.

Everyone works efficiently for at least six hours one day, everyone is mostly responsible for one job, and tries to achieve it to a first-class level. People serve and treat each other equally.  Paradise management is implemented here as we believe the best management is no management. There is no management teams or leaders, there is no constitution, laws, statutes, commandments, or dharma. Each branch has only one director, whose role is to arrange and coordinate the branch’s daily production and activities.  

C. New Social System 
- One global government + university of universal values education + ecovillages lifestyle

We have a bold vision: the earth will enter into a new age where human beings will grow up to a higher level of consciousness and create a brand new social mode. Countries, political parties, religions, and traditional families will no longer exist; wars, conflicts, fights, and crimes will disappear, and all resources will be shared among people on earth. There is no private ownership any more. There will be a global government responsible for the whole management of administrative affairs on the earth, since there is no countries, political parties, traditional families any more, leaders of the global government will be chosen from the most excellent persons who are totally selfless and fair. Besides, under the universal values, the essence of different nations and cultures will be integrated into a new human beings culture, and the earth will become a harmonious planet with diversity blossoming everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/new-oasis-for-life-the-second-home-of-lifechanyuan-the-4th-branch/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/new-oasis-for-life-the-second-home-of-lifechanyuan-the-4th-branch/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our community was established in April 2009 in Yunnan China by a group of people who held common universal values and the vision of creating a new life mode for human beings to sustain themselves on earth.

Yunnan is a region that offers the best weather and rich natural resources in China. We set up three branches in two years and the community members rose from the original 20, up to 150. We did all the designing and construction, as well as raised all the funds by ourselves. After three years of construction, each branch became a very beautiful and harmonious environment with members living happily together, including 20 elder members and 14 children. We received visitors from more than 15 countries within two years.</description>

An Oasis where one can come, meditate, and ground in self and nature.  An Oasis where one can come, tend organic gardens, and share vegetarian meals grounding in nature and community.  An Oasis, where it is safe to explore those &quot;you's&quot; that have remained veiled and hidden and want to be opened and examined, grounding in self and life. An Oasis where you are welcome to create gatherings for celebration, teaching, arts, organizing, grounding in community.

1. To create more financial freedom and emotional enrichment for each of us by living interdependently, mindful of environmental responsibilities and sustainable practices in our community living.
2.  To create an inclusive environment that embraces our extended families and welcomes our friends.
3.  To create sustainable practices that embody our values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/rarebirds-housing-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/rarebirds-housing-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The RareBirds are a group of 6 investors currently comprising 3 couples and 2 single women in Kamloops, BC.  Together we have build a 6,000 square ft home on the edge of the downtown area.  We have about 1/2 acre of property that overlooks a gorge with an amazing view of the valley.  Our home is spacious with lots of natural light.  The common space has a large open space living, dining and kitchen area with a walk in pantry and access to 2 patio areas.  The lower floor has a multi-purpose room, a guest room and bath and a quiet room for meditation or yoga.  Private space consists of 6 bed sitting rooms with bath that range from 380 sq ft to 410 sq ft. each  2 units are on the main floor and 4 on the upper floor with a common area library and east facing deck.  We are multi generational and adult oriented, ranging in age from 50 to 73. Some members working full or part time and some are retired.  We currently have a dog in our family.  Cats are not an option because of pet allergies, but a second dog might be considered.
We are a busy active household.  Our members typically engage in outdoor and cultural activities, volunteer in the community and travel widely.
After 3 years of planning and 2 years of test driving,  we feel we are well on our way to living into our shared vision.</description>

The Living Energy Farm is a project to build a community, education center, and farm that demonstrates that a fulfilling life is possible without the use of any fossil fuel. Our mission is to serve as an example and actively promote lifestyles and technologies that are truly sustainable, and to make these sustainable technologies accessible to all persons regardless of their income or social position. 

LEF is a zero fossil fuel school and community. Our goal is to demonstrate that it is possible to live a healthy joyful life without the use of any fossil fuel, and to promote this lifestyle far and wide. 

We operate an organic farm that grows vegetable and grain seeds for income. We produce all of our own electricity with photovoltaics, and we run our tractors on woodgas, a low-grade biofuel. We heat our homes and cook our food with solar energy. We grow a large percentage of our own food, and preserve the harvest by drying and canning. 

We also host interns and volunteers in an educational program covering diverse areas of modern sustainable living, including organic gardening and orcharding, green building, solar water and space heating, solar electricity, woodgas, composting toilets, bicycle repair, and other subjects. Most importantly, LEF teachs about the importance of sustainable technology in context, about when and where such technologies are effective and when they are not. The most powerful sustainable “technology” we employ is cooperative living.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21743&quot;&gt;Bruderhof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Bruderhof is an international communal movement of families and singles who seek to put into action Christ’s command to love God and neighbor.
 
Like the first Christians described in Acts 2 and 4, we have been called to a way of life in which all are of one heart and soul, no one possesses anything, and everything is shared in common. We also draw instruction and inspiration from the Reformation era Anabaptists who revived the early Christian example of discipleship in full community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bruderhof/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bruderhof/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
The Bruderhof is an international communal movement of families and singles who seek to put into action Christ’s command to love God and neighbor.
 
Like the first Christians described in Acts 2 and 4, we feel called to a way of life in which all are of one heart and soul, no one possesses anything, and everything is shared in common. We also draw inspiration from the Anabaptists of the Reformation era who revived the early Christian example of discipleship in full community.
Jesus Christ and his spirit and teachings are the foundation of our community. We come from many cultures, countries, and walks of life. We have no private property but share everything in common, as the early Christians did. Each member gives his or her talents, time, and efforts wherever they are needed. Money and possessions are voluntarily pooled, and in turn each member is provided for and cared for. Meals are eaten together, and meetings for fellowship, singing, prayer, or decision making are held several evenings a week. Meetings are held in a large circle.  Someone leads each meeting, but we don't have someone preaching and everyone else listening. We are conscious of our shortcomings, yet we are committed to trying to live out Jesus’ way, not only on Sundays, but every day.
The family is the basic unit of our community, though many of our members are single adults. Marriage is upheld as a sacred vow between one man and one woman that assumes faithfulness until death. Our families and community are built on this faithfulness and commitment – to God and to each other. We value modesty and sexual purity, and expect the same of our children and guests.
Founded in 1920, our community was one of many that sprang up in Germany after World War I among young people disillusioned with a society based on competition and greed and a church that had blessed the war. Eberhard Arnold, his wife Emmy, and a circle of fellow seekers left middle-class Berlin to start a rural settlement in the spirit of early Christianity and the Radical Reformation of the early 1500s, when thousands of Anabaptists left the institutional churches to live a life of sharing and service in Christian communities. During the 1930s, Nazi persecution forced the fledgling community to resettle in England.
We believe every human life is sacred, and for this reason we are opposed to war, abortion, and capital punishment. We have a long history of pacifism and remain committed to working for peace, reconciliation, and social justice. In community we can put this into practice. We hope to show by example that it is possible for ordinary people to live a life that addresses the needs of the whole person and the root causes of injustice, war, and isolation.
At the same time we remain involved in our neighbourhoods and wider society. We support disaster relief efforts, peace projects and assist with many local activities in schools, churches and hospitals.
Children are part of the reason we live together as we do. Children need an environment in which they can remain children, unencumbered by the materialism and violence in our society. Parents have the primary responsibility for their care and education, but have the support of teachers in our school and the rest of the community. Teenagers attend local colleges before moving on to further education, voluntary service, or other work.
Membership requires a voluntary lifetime commitment, so it is a choice that can only be made as an adult. Those who grow up in the community are encouraged to spend time elsewhere so they can make a mature, independent choice.
Work is love made visible. From washing clothes in the communal laundry or teaching in the school, to weighing a baby in the community clinic or fixing a water main, our communal work is a practical expression of our love for one another. No one receives a wage or salary. We earn our living by manufacturing and selling Community Playthings (classroom furniture and play equipment).
Disabled and elderly members enrich our community with their vitality and experience, and participate in the communal work as their strength allows. Because the community (which includes members who are doctors and nurses) is like an extended family, we are usually able to care for our sick and elderly at home and whenever possible, death takes place within the supportive atmosphere of the church community.

      <name>The Barley Jar - Urban Ecovillage and Spiritual Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21744&quot;&gt;The Barley Jar - Urban Ecovillage and Spiritual Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Ecological, spiritual and social sustainability and permaculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-barley-jar/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-barley-jar/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
The Barley Jar is an evolving Plum Village inspired permaculture training and practice centre and development site, learning and practicing to live harmoniously with each other and the natural world. We aim to do this to the utmost degree possible. The community is also a kind of research and development laboratory striving to achieve the deepest level of social, spiritual and environmental permaculture based on the Plum Village Tradition and the best available science. 
Our desire is to be the change we want to see in the world.


The tradition of Plum Village and Thich Nhat Hanh is a non-denominational spiritual tradition open to individuals of any persuasion ranging from atheist to Catholic, Muslim, Jewish or similar. This tradition focuses on mindfulness in daily life. Though they arise from a Buddhist vision for a global spirituality and ethic, it's practices are nonsectarian, and their nature is universal.


We will give preference to individuals who are interested in training and deepening their practice at the Barley Jar and ultimately becoming longer term stable members of our community. We are also open to shorter term guests. Currently our community is typically comprised of 2-3 long term members and 3-4 shorter to medium term guests.


Training and deepening practice is possible through  a program of courses and activities being developed at the Barley Jar in which residents and broader community members can deepen their practice of permaculture and the Plum Village and Barley Jar traditions. These also include reading and study groups and participation in local retreats and practice opportunities.


We share meals/cooking, groceries, cleaning/chores, music/art/ideas, joint parties, community dinners, collective space and household items, a mixture of privacy and community,...We have positive shared values / enthusiasm for sustainable transportation (bikes, no cars owned), local organic, vegetarian/vegan, natural materials (plastic free), fair trade ...inclusion and diversity are highly valued and desired e.g. no labels / all ages / all abilities / queer-positive / all backgrounds / all social (including marginalized) groups etc. 


Our house is medium to large, we really like having people around as well as having a balance of privacy, we like having guests.Our members positively contribute to our community and to the network of similar homes that we are a part of. 


Physically: We live in a century home at the north end of Brunswick Ave, the house has 6 bedrooms. There are lots of shared spaces - a kitchen, 2 bathrooms, sunroom, dining room, living room, patio-deck, garden. We generally have 6-8 housemates including couples and kids...


Our members tend to be community activists, social change agents, artists and farmers.


We host:

- community wide sunday dinners once a month (last sunday of the month - potluck optional with a music jam) all are welcome
- workshops (anything and everything - politics, art, sustainability, social justice)
- music and art events (house concerts, readings and the like)
- guests from all over

    

Community Healing:

- The Barley Jar is engaged in a new exploratory healing journey which is making available a room for anyone seeking habitation in Toronto who might want to live and practice with us. The space is reserved for those who have been without a home for long periods of time ....ask for more from any of our members...</description>

Cooperative, sustainable housing in Houston’s urban core

The HAUS Project was formed in late 2010 to provide affordable, sustainable, cooperative housing in the accessible, urban core of the Houston region within close proximity of Houston’s growing light rail transit system. 

The first house, Rosalie, opened on January 1, 2011 in Midtown and now houses ten people in its ten rooms. We’ve since expanded to include a second 15 bedroom house on Ruth St.  We intend to develop houses of various sizes and appropriate for various lifestyle options, including at least one student focused house, and at least one house appropriate for children and families.

We are always looking for future members and are especially looking for people who are excited about being on the front lines of developing our next house.

The mission of HAUS Project is to:

Provide affordable housing operated cooperatively by residents.
Provide greener, more sustainable lifestyle options.
Educate the general public about cooperative organizational principles and greener, more sustainable lifestyle options.
Assist other cooperative and sustainable efforts in the Houston region and elsewhere.

We are living together in harmony, being healthy, exercising and constantly learning from ourselves and others. We are committed to the cultivation of body, mind and spirit in self, culture and nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/rancho-la-salud-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/rancho-la-salud-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
A new gated community is being created near Ajijic, Mexico, a sustainable Cohousing village. The Lake Chapala area has long been touted as one of the best retirement places on earth, and now comes a new kind of place to retire, Rancho La Salud Village. This is “community by design” where the residents themselves work together to create their village.
This community will be the first Cohousing community in Mexico, and one of the most comprehensive. It will consist of an international neighborhood of 11 homes, 20 townhomes and 6 residential suites that concentrates on sustainability (total on-site solar energy and water generation, on-site disposal of water and waste, organically growing our own food),  health and wellness (following the guidelines established by AARP in the Blue Zone), adult learning and teaching, organic farming and permaculture, aging in place, and longevity. The land is purchased, the common house is built, and the lots are approved. We are ready to move onto the next step, that of forming community with the people who will live here.  All residents own their own lot and home and a percentage of the common ground.

Teremos ainda a casa do mel, onde serão ensinadas as técnicas em apicultura, centro de vivências e do conhecimento, e o núcleo de saúde com terapias naturais para prevenção de doenças. 
Para alcançarmos a meta de lixo zero será construído um galpão de reciclagem para administrar o lixo da comunidade e do entorno. 
As crianças do Portal do Sol terão uma escola onde pretendemos utilizar a Pedagogia 3000. Esta escola estará aberta às crianças das cidades vizinhas.
Todo o Projeto Portal do Sol está sendo documentado para ser copiado em outros locais, com as adaptações necessárias. Já fizemos diversas parcerias, com o Grupo de Escoteiros da cidade, a UERGS, universidade local, Espaço Holístico Solar (medicina alternativa) e Pastoral da Saúde (fitoterápicos). Atualmente já temos um morador no local, utilizamos energias renováveis (eólica e fotovoltaica), a trilha do Tatu já está em funcionamento e temos um local para eventos para 72 pessoas sentadas, na forma de uma Geodésica e uma cozinha campeira. As visitas deverão ser agendadas pelo e-mail contato@portaldosol.org.br.</description>

“Saba” is translated as “tomorrow” in the tongue of the native Abenaki people and this intentional community is planned according to the needs of tomorrow:  Wholistically creating peaceful, voluntary, sustainable alternatives to meeting human needs on physical, mental, spiritual and social levels. 

Saba is a social enterprise dedicated to assisting communities with integrating cooperative housing with complementary and alternative healthcare services as well as community education on permaculture, arts, and sustainable living practices.  

Saba's mission is to assist communities with goals to becoming ecologically and economically sustainable.  Saba’s projects include the utilization of local building materials and passive and active solar collection and storage systems for energy.  Further, in this bioregion, a significant concern for structures is heat retention during the cold season.  Saba's projects use the support of nature for this purpose using earth-sheltered structure designs for the community and living quarters, as well as in the design of greenhouses.  Saba’s goal is to promote harvesting and storage of rainwater through the use of specific drainage designs and water catchment systems as well as gray water recycling.

Saba's mission is to assist with the development of sustainable food systems that meet the community’s food needs while maintaining healthy ecosystems. Saba commits to the use of permaculture principles to promote regeneration of healthy ecological conditions not only for the current community, but for generations to come. Permaculture is based on working with, not against nature and promoting human dignity and health, animal welfare, social justice and environmental sustainability.  The anticipated application of the permaculture design integrates local plants, edible forest gardening, pasture-paddock chicken raising, proper utilization of all potential waste products such as with composting, biologically diverse polyculture herb and vegetable gardens, and the utilization of natural patterns found in nature in the gardens, greenhouses, and structures.</description>

Community functioning while seeking rural (not remote) land near Eugene, Oregon, and additional members.  We honor all generations from children to elders.  Vision statement at website.

Our main external focus is on services of healing and wellness to the outside community and the planet, with special focus on spiritual/energetic work but offering all modalities for which our current or future members may be qualified:  healing, counseling, workshops, seminars, retreats, acupuncture, allopathic, etc.  Those with relevant skills are therefore especially welcome, but don't hold back if you are not trained in an eneregy healing modality, because you can be.  Others also welcome.  Not all members need to be healers, since there is the usual IC work to be done: gardening, construction and maintenance, shared childcare, administration, etc.

We promote our own emotional and spiritual well-being and personal growth through mutual respect, empathy, and compassion; mutual support and help in life’s difficulties and puzzles; and just enjoying life and each other’s company.

We currently support ourselves with Reiki Tummo healing, other energetic healing, life coaching, writing, and other home office work.  When we acquire land, we want to provide for our own physical survival comfortably and sustainably.

Sustainable self-sufficiency: growing most food; partial off-grid power with potential for 100% off-grid if necessary.  Chickens, maybe sheep, goats, llamas, etc.  Barter, trade, and buy other items.

We anticipate separate living quarters on shared land plus a community building and shared outbuildings.  You could also live off the premises.

We share labor and cash costs; your other money stays yours, as does your free time.  Outside jobs, home offices, and cottage industries welcome.

Deep ecology.  Utilizing solar photovoltaics, solar hot water, biking for transportation, gardening, fruit and nut orchard, black soldier fly composting, humanure composting, rainwater catchment, rocket stove/wood gasifier, coppicing nitrogen fixing trees for green manure, fodder, fuel, building materials, near zero waste, living simple so others can simply live.  Lacto ovo vegetarians.  60 laying chickens, 12 goats, 1 dog, 5 cats.

We are deep ecology, sustainable  homestead that incorporates Organic, Sustainable,  Permaculture,  Regenerative Agroforestry,  Agroecological principals in order to live within the means of the land.  We live more simply so others (*human and other species”) can simply live.  Popai has evolved into a sustainable living and educational project..I’m an idealist and would like to live in a fair, sustainable, healthy planet where we are wise stewards and reawaken to our interdependency in the web of life, and the necessity of “care giving”/leaving/giving back .  We seek to take only what we need and to live within the means of 3.5 acres available per person on the Earth, which is our Earth Fair Share amount of space to live within the carrying capacity of the biologically productive land and sea.  Three acres provides just food, modest shelter and a small amount of energy to cook food, but not for transportation, eating meat, or for cash crops (coffee, tea, chocolate, tobacco, meat [or crops like soy and corn used to feed livestock], sugar, oil crops/palm/canola, cotton, flowers, monocropped forests/eucalyptus, biofuels for cars).   I’m not talking about the amount of acreage ones house is on but the space needed to manufacture all of their needs  That means we have  to live simply and only require 3.5 acres to provide all of our needs for food, fiber, fuel, fodder, fineries, fencing, fun, pharmacy, and shelter.    In order to live fairly we have to practice “willful restraint”, lower our standard of living/consumption, stop the use of dirty inappropriate technologies, reduce our human populations, and reduce our land space requirements from e.g. 25 acres  per person in the U.S. to 3.5.  We are currently “six planet living” when there is only one Earth, so in order to co create a fair, sustainable, and healthy planet we have to learn to live “One planet living”. Our industrial society is a planetary plaque, a cancer,  with all of the social, medical and environmental  ills (war, crime, drugs, terrorists, have/have nots, cancer, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Asthma, Allergies, pollution of our soil, water and air,  soil erosion,  soil impoverishment,  6th wave of species extinction, 150 species going extinct daily, 35,000 people starving each day,  etc.) and we accept, acquiesce, accommodate to  the side effects of our rapacious, “taker”  society, just like a frog who is placed in warm water and slowly brought up to a boil without a struggle.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21754&quot;&gt;New Vrindaban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To protect cows, be self sufficient, a place of pilgrimage, offer spiritual education and above all develop love for Krishna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/new-vrindaban/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/new-vrindaban/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Founded in 1968 by disciples of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, New Vrindaban became the first rural farming community of the Hare Krishna movement in the U.S.

In the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia, about one hour from Pittsburgh, PA thousands of visitors from all religions and nationalities  come annually to have a spiritual retreat and partake of the many festivals. People also like to attend work parties to get hands on experience in our certified organic gardens.

New Vrindaban is a great opportunity for WWOOFERS, Help Exers, Work Exchangers to not only learn and share experiences in farming and caring for the Earth but to also hike and bike our 2,000 wooded acres.  Many streams and creeks are available for a swim on a hot day.

The spiritual aspects, based on the Vedic ancient holy texts of India, make for a well rounded body, mind and soul experience.  The diet is lacto vegetarian.  Proper care for the cows who provide us with milk and manure for our gardens is very important.

We have set up WWOOF GLOBAL VILLAGES (WGVs).  which serve as meeting point for WWOOFERS in India.  The main objective of WGV is that the WOOFERS from different countries will stay and could meet each other here and share their WWOOFING experience in India. At WVG the WWOOFERs could relax from their hectic WWOOFING farm schedule and expected only to work just 3-4 hours daily and are free for lot of sight-seeing and travel to places of tourist interest so that they become close to experience the Indian historical and cultural background which they can take back home . The project is situated at Village Surajpura near World famous Khajuraho temple town in MP state in India , which is adjacent to the Ken River and Panna Tiger Reserve. 
The proposed WGV in long run would function, evolving into a model of sustainability using traditional knowledge and cultural practices.  This would closely work with the farmers in various clusters of villages in development of organic agriculture, education for children, local handicrafts and other village developmental activities. People will stay in the traditional family homes with the family and eat delicious traditional food . The Ultimate goal of the WGV would be to regenerate soil, conserve water, raise the water table, work along “Natural Farming” methods towards a model of self-sufficiency on all fronts.

      <name>Immaculate Conception Benedictine Priory</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21756&quot;&gt;Immaculate Conception Benedictine Priory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Ecumenical Benedictines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/immaculate-conception-benedictine-priory/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/immaculate-conception-benedictine-priory/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ecumenical Benedictine Community within the catholic tradition whose mission is to pray constantly and work for the reconciliation and unity of Christians.
Our Priory in formation welcomes those with a call for reconciliation and unity in order to make possible the desire of Christ &quot;that all may be one&quot; (Jn. 17). Our monastic community is above all else a reconciled community within itself. Being reconciled, allows us to embark in the work of reconciliation and unity of Christians.
The Ecumenical Mission of this Priory is rooted in sane teachings and tradition of the church of Christ:
“…The attainment of union is the concern of the whole Church, faithful and shepherds alike. This concern extends to everyone, according to his talent, whether it be exercised in his daily Christian life or in his theological and historical research. This concern itself reveals already to some extent the bond of brotherhood between all Christians and it helps toward that full and perfect unity which God in His kindness wills.

There can be no ecumenism worthy of the name without a change of heart. For it is from renewal of the inner life of our minds, from self-denial and an unstinted love that desires of unity take their rise and develop in a mature way. We should therefore pray to the Holy Spirit for the grace to be genuinely self-denying, humble. gentle in the service of others, and to have an attitude of brotherly generosity towards them. St. Paul says: &quot;I, therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and meekness, with patience, forbearing one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace&quot;.  This exhortation is directed especially to those raised to sacred Orders precisely that the work of Christ may be continued. He came among us &quot;not to be served but to serve&quot;.

Part of our mission is to preserve 150 acres of mature woodlands owned in common on the hill overlooking Goose Pond and Moose Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/goose-pond-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/goose-pond-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Beech Cobble Landowners Association was formed from other communes in 1973 to preserve a wooded private 232-acre site overlooking Goose Pond (a 625 acre lake located in rural Canaan, NH.) 

Householders own 10 to 25 acres, plus an undivided 1/6 share in 137 acres of common land. Decisions are made by consensus. There are now three households living on different sections of the land and three pieces for sale. We are actively looking for new members. 

We're located within half hour of Lebanon, Hanover, Dartmouth College, White River Junction, VT, Rts. 91 and 89, organic farms, and food coops. Although the area is full of culture, creativity, and conscious connection, our land is at the end of a woodsy gravel road. It has mature trees, rocky but fertile soil, some water and mountain views, lots of wildlife, loon calls, and a trail brings you to our lake frontage across from a wild park with wonderful places to swim and a boat put in. Appalachian Trail, skiing, and 16,000 preserved acres within 10 miles. We have cell phone and Internet access on MiFi.

We're in our 50s-60s, two of us living an off-grid solar homesteading lifestyle. We seek others of all ages with similar and complementary goals, skills, and values. Interests include black smithing, writing, organic gardening, simple living, nature and environment, counseling, energy healing, drumming, and shamanism. We hope to attract flexible, healthy, aware, emotionally mature, sustainable living activists (pagans welcome!) who want to work, play, and live in a small loose community that uses consensus. You must be financially able to build or renovate after a process of getting to know each other, however land (and houses) available here are pretty affordable.  We are in a no zoning town where alterntive building is easier than most places. 

Would love to share: some common gardens and a greenhouse, regular meals, meetings, community service projects, tasks such as wood gathering and splitting, permaculture, canning, stewarding the common land, path making, hiking, kayaking, building a cordwood sauna, trips to town, being active for a better world, fire circles, shamanic journeys, earth rituals/celebrations, plus resources such as wood splitter, truck, etc.

FOR SALE: 1. 25 acres (3 acres open, rest wooded with lots of mature white pine for building), large post and beam house in need of extensive repair or salvage/tear down, plus workshop/garage, excellent artesian well, older septic, underground electric, driveway, possible to move another small house onto the land from next door, $70,000 or best offer, possible owner financing; 2. Wooded 20 acre, off-grid, south facing piece w/shared drive and artesian well, about $30,000; 3. Land in either piece could be subdivided once and sold to others acceptable to the community. 

Possible co-creation waiting.

Sustainable living&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/greenbriar/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/greenbriar/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Greenbriar is an intentional community on 170 wooded acres near Austin,Texas, whose focus is in supporting and sustaining Marsalom Inc. the  non-profit, educational corporation that owns and operates Greenbriar School.  

     The school was a part of the free school movement begun in the sixties.  Fueled in part by the belief that we are all life long learners, that we learn best in a safe, supportive   atmosphere, and that learning takes place everywhere, not just in a classroom, we have developed a dynamic, flexible, student centered curriculum and facility that is constantly changing to meet the needs of our students based on their current interests. Participation in community life is an integral part of the learning process.
    In many ways, life at Greenbriar is about simplicity and with the awareness that every action of ours today will influence the next generations.  To that end, we strive to live more consciously, in our interactions with one another and with the world/environment around us.  
     Greenbriar School does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. 
The land and all of the structures belong to the corporation.

We believe in open and honest dialogue and place a heavy emphasis on relationship building as a foundation to create a safe and inviting experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/fortunity/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/fortunity/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Please be aware we are currently restarting at the moment, seeking more core-committed or equity-invested members to proceed more effectively. 

fortunity reflects an urban community lifestyle based on a complex combination of residential, commercial, and rural properties with interwoven related projects. Our passion above and beyond living and working together is communication -- in many forms. Though we may tend towards lengthy and intensive planning discussions at times, the goal is to apply the results in productive fashion. Check out our website for more info, and to schedule a visit or tour if curious.

Please also note: we would best be defined as 'spiritual not religious', represent many different ideologies, dietary paths, and cultivate open minded but grounded and healthy lifestyle choices. Pets, addictions, and substance abuse are not welcome here, but responsible and conscious living definitely is.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21760&quot;&gt;Valterra Village eCohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To build a friendly and safe community that meets the social and private needs of all ages with a small ecological footprint and options for sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/valterra-village-ecohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/valterra-village-ecohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;At Valterra Village, we are creating a cohousing community on a semi-rural property in the town of Qualicum Beach, Vancouver Island.  The development intends to incorporate green building technologies within the typical pedestrian-friendly community of clustered homes and extensive common facilities.

From the Valterra site, a pleasant 35 minute walk, mostly along an existing trail system through Town-owned land, brings one into the town core.  It is also a mere 10 minute walk down Laburnum Road to the new Qualicum Beach Elementary School.  The serene location is set amidst beautiful Crown land forests, Town-owned parkland, and a buffer of privately-owned land adjacent to Laburnum Road.

To make the project more affordable and customizable, a proposal for two cohousing communities may be put forward.  A multi-generational community of +/- 30 units would have spaces for all ages such as a tot lot and playroom, sound-proofed music room/teen space, craft room, mini gym, adult retreat, etc.  This could be complimented by a community focused on empty nesters / seniors consisting of +/- 20 units with features geared towards &quot;aging in place&quot; including universal accessibility and a suite for a caregiver in the common house. 

The site affords plenty of room for the two communities, shared orchards and gardens.  Combined with 13 acres of adjacent farmland, the result would be much like the two communities that make up Yarrow Ecovillage in the Fraser Valley.  There, several families in Groundswell Cohousing have a live/work situation as they lease the 20 acre certified organic commercial farm alongside other residents of Yarrow http://www.yarrowecovillage.ca/.

How involved individuals would be in the extensive lands outside of their actual community would be their choice.  Some people are happy to participate in what cohousing offers in terms of social interaction at the heart of the community – the common house - while others are excited to extend that experience to include producing their own organic food in the community gardens.

For a wealth of information about cohousing, including a video and slide show, visit the Canadian Cohousing Network at http://www.cohousing.ca/. Of special note is this video produced for the Belterra Cohousing Community on Bowen Island entitled &quot;What is a Home&quot; http://www.cohousing.org/node/1738.

Mana is the Hawaiian word for divine power, the life force within all things. Mana Gardens LLC owns 89 acres of the last lowland rain forest in the United States. Stewardship by Miss Green over several years has won government funding for the LLC to plan a native forest restoration. The plan is to restore the native habitat for the resident native dragonflies, native snails, native honey-creepers, and Hawaiian hawks (which are members of a threatened species). The planned project should bring in Federal and State funding to create dozens of part-time jobs. Miss Green has received more than a hundred letters of support from local residents, educators, business leaders and a senator. All members will actively work together to create and steward a sustainable agricultural community. Miss Green cultivates and sells heart-shaped flamingo lilies that grow by the thousands in the forest. All activities are conducted with the aloha spirit of unconditional love.
Temperatures range from 70-85º F daytime and 60-70º F nighttime. It rains almost every day, occasionally six inches per day. No need for any irrigation. Water supply is rain-catchment. County water is free 4 miles away. Miss Green cultivates many seasonal avocado trees and year-round herb and flower gardens. The Gardens gently slope at around 900 feet of elevation on the east rift zone of an active volcano. Walk, bicycle or roll 2 miles to Pahoa town with laundromat, stores and library. The Hilo international airport (ITO) is 22 miles away. Walk, bicycle or roll ten miles to the lava-warmed coastal waters for decent surfing and boating. Small-scale solar power and composting toilets are popular in the area. Internet and cell phone signals are good in certain spots and fair in others. New cell-phone towers are planned to meet the growing demand.
Members and visitors may enjoy solitude, commune with nature, garden or work on a project. Projects are listed at http://www.green247.org including the online flower shop. The flower business has a zero-carbon footprint until the flowers leave the garden for delivery. A managing member in good standing has a voice at annual meetings and may develop two acres for private use. Loyalty is required to maintain governance rights in a limited liability company.
New members are welcome to apply to join the limited liability company that owns the property. A maximum of 17 members will equally steward the LLC.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21764&quot;&gt;Sat Yoga Ashram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We function as an advanced wisdom school to train serious yogis and shamans in transformational skills. The school functions in an ashram, a residential community of dedicated healers and teachers. Around the ashram core an eco-village is being built, to serve those individuals and families with children who would like to receive the benefits of living near an ashram/wisdom school that is anchoring a cultural renaissance, without making as complete a commitment as do the core members of the spiritual order of Sat Yoga. The eco-village will one day host schools for children, an innovative university, clinics and spa, a hotel, and a retirement community with an elder care center/hospice as well.  To all we offer a refuge of peace and higher vision in this time of global cataclysmic change, to accelerate the transformation of human consciousness and contribute to the creation of a new divine culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sat-yoga-eco-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sat-yoga-eco-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We welcome women and men from every culture and religious background, of every shade of skin color, of all ages. The Sat Yoga Ashram is a community of paradox. We are preparing for off-grid living and radical change but we uphold the classical principles of beauty and high culture. We are a community based on ancient universal Dharma, including the principles of non-violence, truthfulness, friendship and synergy, yet always pouring the ancient wine of spiritual truth into new bottles for the delight of the postmodern consciousness. We value the arts and are developing new forms of music, drama, and philosophy. We process our wounds and conflicts in confidential transformational sessions. We grow our own organic vegetarian food and we are becoming self-sustaining. 

We often hold formal retreats and invite people from all over the world to participate. Some are accepted for longer term individual immersion retreats. We invite scholars and artists to come and spend time in residence and teach what they know as well as have time to create and heal their own wounds. We are creating a refuge for those who seek transcendence of the ego.

If you feel called to join us, please attend a retreat and get to know us and this sacred land. There is an admission process and a period of orientation and trial to ensure you would feel at home here and that you share the vision and the way of life we offer.</description>

Isidore the Laborer (1070-1130), was a beloved Christian saint, known for his love to the poor and to the animals.  He is considered the patron saint of farmers, day laborers, and rural communities.  Our goal at St Isidore is to live together in community, supporting each other along life's journey, finding ways we can serve and help others in need.  Ideally we would share several  meals together throughout the week, and have a little bit of time each day for daily prayer.  We would like to start by buying a house in the city of Battle Creek, Michigan, with enough yard space to do some organic gardening. 

As of February, 2016, we are still looking for interested individuals.  It would be great if we could get going either in 2017 or 2018.

Please call or e-mail if you might be interested in joining.  We look forward to hearing from you!  You also might want to consider joining the Meet-up Group:  http://www.meetup.com/Battle-Creek-Intentional-Community-St-Isidore/

      <name>HeartTribe Village &amp; Chrysalis</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21766&quot;&gt;HeartTribe Village &amp; Chrysalis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; eco-spiritual living, loving and healing through deep listening and heart-connection with all beings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/hearttribe-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/hearttribe-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
We are currently forming HeartTribe Village based on a 5th dimensional paradigm for community living. As we join Gaia in her ascension process during The Great Shift that is in progress now, we too must shift and change and let go of old ways that no longer serve the good of all. It is time to open our hearts, witness our emotions, heal our pain bodies, transcend our egos, and live authentically in harmony with all living beings based upon love. 

We are starting with a small group of Wise Women who are embodying the Divine Feminine, learning to matrix surf,  and shifting our DNA through various shamanic practices and quantum technologies. We are learning to witness our egos and rise above them as we center in our Inner Wise Selves and live from the heart. Each Wise Woman is going within to do our inner journey work during the fall and winter of 2016-2017.  By the fall equinox of 2017, we plan to each build or acquire a mobile tiny home with which we can eventually form a caravan and have our first gathering. This will enable us to be flexible and go with the Flow of Earth changes and Cosmic events as well as political and economic upheaval.  

HeartTribe will be a communal, residential non-profit community that is resource-based and built on a foundation of joyous co-creation with Gaia and all who live upon her. We are invoking the energies of the Divine Feminine &amp;amp; of the devic realms. We are taking full responsibility for our creations both individually and collectively. Most importantly, we are learning to live from our hearts and in unconditional love so that we may model a new paradigm for the planet based in a gifting economy philosophy known in Africa as &quot;Ubuntu&quot;.  

Eventually we intend to build &quot;hobbit-style&quot; Earth Houses(partly underground) and become 100% off-grid. Everything we do is intended to be in harmony with the local nature spirits (as they have done at Findhorn, Sirius, and Perelandra) and a co-creative venture where deep listening is paramount. We also embrace the ancient Mayan idea that &quot;time is art&quot; and plan to practice and model a more natural way of flowing with time rather than the current artificial clock. 

Central to our vision is also the desire to create a spiritual retreat center in the central common house dome called &quot;Chrysalis&quot;. This will be a place where people can come and &quot;cocoon&quot;, witness a new way of life, and be supported in their own personal &quot;metamorphosis&quot;. Those who live in HeartTribe will serve as the staff, teachers, and healers who facilitate Chrysalis retreats, events, art workshops and playshops.  This Chrysalis will be like a an ashram where people find that their guru is within. 

We are envisioning using wind/solar/&amp;amp; geothermal power as well as creating innovative perma-culture projects, shamanic rituals, composting toilets, a home-school cooperative, a labyrinth, an eco-spiritual education program, local barter exchanges, and possibly a&quot;living machine&quot; to process gray waters.

We envision starting out with a village of 7 tiny homes and  building others as the demand arises. All members will be trained in spiritual empowerment &amp;amp; cooperative decision-making skills. We hope to begin building by 2018 once the appropriate location is determined somewhere in upstate NY. 

It is time as the Tribe of Many Colors to create the future we all dream of because We are the Ones we have been waiting for:)

We have created a community for older adults and have built on a property on the edge of Saskatoon’s revitalized cultural core that meets our goal of locating within walking or biking distance of most of our needs. A charming bike and pedestrian trail runs the length of 17th Street and connects with the riverside trail system. The residents have actively participated in the planning with the goal to create an old-fashioned neighbourhood that supports friendly cooperation, socializing, mutual support and environmental responsibility. We currently have one unit for resale. Individuals or couples interested in our project are invited to contact us.

It is being created to demonstrate a model for sustainable living and community empowerment that upholds the Balinese philosophy of Tri Hita Karana, which balances our harmony with man, nature, and God or Universal Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/taman-petanu-eco-neighborhood/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/taman-petanu-eco-neighborhood/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Taman Petanu Eco Neighborhood is a beautiful 1.5 Hectare property just 15 minutes south of Ubud, Bali. The founders came together and began to form the community vision in 2009. As of December 2015, construction on the common facilities has finished and half of members' homes are completed or under construction.

The neighborhood includes 18 self-contained private plots, which are supported by a range of common access facilities including: centralized waste and wastewater treatment, permaculture landscaping, pool, playground, barbecue &amp; gathering area, amphitheater and pavilion for workshops and events. When purchasing a lot, members also purchase a share in the common facilities proportional to their lot size.

Please see our website for updated details on opportunities to purchase a lot or live in the neighborhood.</description>

      <name>New Oasis For Life ( Lifechanyuan China 1)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21771&quot;&gt;New Oasis For Life ( Lifechanyuan China 1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; A. New Universal Values
In our community, we have a harmonious relationship between people and nature. Everyone enjoy a simple and happy life here, the instances of crimes and fights are zero. Arguments, quarrels, and conflicts are very rare.

This is because of the solid basis of the universal values we had built before the community was established. It was initiated and written by the founder Xuefeng, and since 2001, he has written more than 2500 articles with over 10 million words in Chinese. Before participating in setting up the community, all members are first resonating with the values, include the dream of creating a sustainable new life mode beyond the limits of countries, nationalities, religions, and races; and bringing people real happy, free, joyful, and blessed lives.

So this values system and the common dream are the deep roots and energy source that motivates all members of the New Oasis for Life under all circumstances.

The content of this Universal Values includes the origin of the universe, the origin of LIFE, the origin of human beings on earth, time, space, consciousness, the value, meaning and purpose of life and LIFE; the crises human beings are faced with, the nature of countries, political parties, religions, marriage and family; the non-material world, and the way of beautifying one’s soul garden etc. It absorbs the wonderful wisdoms of human history such as those of Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Muhammad, and all wisdom essences of sages and saints from different civilizations and cultures.



B. New Life Mode

We have created a new production and life mode. We share the income 100%, all resources are shared, everything belongs to the community, and there is no private property any more.  Living, shelter, eating, clothes, transportation, aging, sickness, and death are all communal responsibilities, including nursing the elderly and educating the children.

Everyone works efficiently for at least six hours one day, everyone is mostly responsible for one job, and tries to achieve it to a first-class level. People serve and treat each other equally.  Paradise management is implemented here as we believe the best management is no management. There is no management teams or leaders, there is no constitution, laws, statutes, commandments, or dharma. Each branch has only one director, whose role is to arrange and coordinate the branch’s daily production and activities.  

C. New Social System 
- One global government + university of universal values education + ecovillages lifestyle

We have a bold vision: the earth will enter into a new age where human beings will grow up to a higher level of consciousness and create a brand new social mode. Countries, political parties, religions, and traditional families will no longer exist; wars, conflicts, fights, and crimes will disappear, and all resources will be shared among people on earth. There is no private ownership any more. There will be a global government responsible for the whole management of administrative affairs on the earth, since there is no countries, political parties, traditional families any more, leaders of the global government will be chosen from the most excellent persons who are totally selfless and fair. Besides, under the universal values, the essence of different nations and cultures will be integrated into a new human beings culture, and the earth will become a harmonious planet with diversity blossoming everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/new-oasis-for-life-the-second-home-of-lifechanyuan-the-1st-branch/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/new-oasis-for-life-the-second-home-of-lifechanyuan-the-1st-branch/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our community was established in April 2009 in Yunnan China by a group of people who held common universal values and the vision of creating a new life mode for human beings to sustain themselves on earth.

Yunnan is a region that offers the best weather and rich natural resources in China. We set up three branches in two years and the community members rose from the original 20, up to 150. We did all the designing and construction, as well as raised all the funds by ourselves. After three years of construction, each branch became a very beautiful and harmonious environment with members living happily together, including 20 elder members and 14 children. We received visitors from more than 15 countries within two years.</description>

Goolawah co-op is a low cost rural land sharing co-operative situated at Crescent Head in NSW Australia. We have 1600 acres of land bordering wilderness area, 4 km from the coast with 78 house sites separated into 3 different areas. We have 3 towns within 45 minuets drive, the beach is accessed via a walking track through the wilderness area or a 20 minute drive to town. 

We are 15 years old with 50 people living on the land full time at October 2015. We are free to build as we like on our own 1.2 acre site and are planning to build a bigger community center in the near future. 

We all live off grid, solar for power, composting toilets, rain and dam water with many members maintaining permaculture designed gardens and orchids. 

We can be found on www.helpx.net if you want to stay in exchange for work, this is the only way to visit and stay. We are actively looking for mentally stable, functioning, financially interdependent, inspiring new members who want to help us create the best community ever!

WE HAVE LAND, PLANS FOR 28 UNITS, AIMING TO BREAK GROUND SPRING 2019. 
Oakleigh Meadow Cohousing (OMC) is an intergenerational community of independent households committed to finding purpose and a sense of belonging through working, learning and playing together in a neighborhood designed to make a small, beautiful footprint on the land.

OMC, Eugene, Oregon's first cohousing community will consist of 28 units; units are still available. We are couples with children, single parents, working singles, and retired folks who believe that life is richer when people of all ages come together to support and share their lives. We value each person for their unique contribution to the community. We want to be nurtured by the companionship offered to one another and to be enjoyed for being ourselves. Our values include finding a balance of simplicity, economy, and quality in developing and maintaining our neighborhood. 

Oakleigh Meadow Cohousing will be built on 2.2 acres of land situated on the beautiful Willamette River which runs through the heart of Eugene. More than 25 miles of pedestrian-bike path running along both sides of the river connects us to nearby parks, a thriving downtown, and the University of Oregon.

Eugene is a city of 156,000 located in the Willamette Valley, which sits east of the Pacific Ocean and west of the Cascade Mountains. It is a city known for its natural beauty, recreational activities (cycling, running, rafting, fly fishing), focus on the arts, and activist political leanings. Temperatures are mild year round, with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Winter snowfall is sporadic and rarely accumulates more than an inch or two. With an hour's drive west from Eugene you can be scouting for whales and enjoying the sound of the surf while walking along sandy ocean beaches. Or head east for an hour to explore the endless wilderness hiking trails and spectacular glaciated mountains of the Oregon Cascade mountains; continue a bit further to reach the fascinating high desert eastern Oregon with its intriguing lava caves and abundant wildlife. 

We know that the decision to join a cohousing community is a major life consideration.  We have a mentoring process to help you decide whether Oakleigh Meadow is a good fit for you and your family. 

 Oakleigh Meadow's site design, which includes five unit types of 2, 3 and 4 bedrooms and our large central common house has been completed and can be viewed upon request.  In the meantime, check out our community's 3D virtual “fly-by“ at oakleighmeadow.org.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21775&quot;&gt;Maa Land Co-op&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Happy viable off-grid alternative to the culture of crazy, focussing on ecology, ethics, permaculture, awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/maa-land-co-op/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/maa-land-co-op/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Happy 22th birthday Maa! congratulations to us :-) 
Maa is a rural land co-op, established in 1994, providing off-grid living on 88 acres of forested mountainside in the Bird Creek watershed on traditional Sinixt Territory.  This unceded First Nations territory is also known as the West Kootenay region, near Nelson, BC, Canada.
 We are a diverse, healthy, vibrant community where we balance living independently with working and playing co-operatively. We value life on the land and strive to live mindfully and with ecological, social and spiritual integrity, recognizing that we each define these things for ourselves and that how we embody them is fluid and changes over time. 
At Maa, we collectively embody a working alternative to individual property through shared land ownership / stewardship and caring, co-operative community.  
Currently (summer 2016) there are 5 houses, with a sixth under construction, and 15 residents on the land (5 are children). The two youngest were born at Maa in January 2016 and August 2013, and the three others will turn three in February (twins) and May.  There are two yurts on the land and we also have a tipi which we set up in the summer.  We have a small amount of electricity available per house (8000 watts shared 6 ways = 1333 watts/house), which is generated by a micro-hydro system that we built and maintain ourselves. Bird Creek runs through the land and provides us with lovely drinking water, electricity, irrigation for the newly expanded co-op garden, and wonderful walking and meditation opportunities.
Since 2012 we've been in a period of growth, with new people joining each year, bringing our total membership to 9 with an additional two people currently in their trial period.  We still have associate memberships available, which  means you would share an existing homesite.  The process to become a member involves a 12-month trial period of living on the land and participating fully in the life of the co-op.  There is walk-in access only during snow months. We have a great sledding run! We have no specific criteria for membership, but life at Maa works best for people who love the land itself, love living rurally / semi-isolated (especially in winter) and really want to be living in and contributing to community.  It is great to have young families on the land; we are enjoying having a cohort of almost 3-year-olds and a new baby in the community. 
The land was originally purchased by a group of women; membership is now a mixture of genders and orientations. Being queer-friendly is essential. 
And for those who are wondering, Maa means land in Estonian.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21776&quot;&gt;Backyard Neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The goal of this group is to connect people in any city or town who want to share all or parts of their backyards to create large, shared spaces, where children can play and learn together spontaneously and neighbors can easily get to know each other, share things, and do things together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/backyard-neighborhoods/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/backyard-neighborhoods/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
The goal of this group is to connect people in any city or town who want to share all or parts of their backyards to create large, shared spaces, where children can play and learn together spontaneously and neighbors can easily get to know each other, share things, and do things together.

Some may just want to share portions of their backyards and nothing else. Others may want to share a few more things, such as tools and outdoor toys, and perhaps share occasional meals outdoors. And some may want to develop into retrofitting cohousing communities with some shared indoor facilities like N Street Cohousing in Davis, California, where fences have gradually been removed from the backyards of 19 houses. Those that focus on permaculture and sustainability might even become urban ecovillages.

Families who practice home and community education (such as unschooling) might be especially interested in sharing backyards and some indoor facilities. Some families might want to pool resources to set up a laboratory or music room, for example, or share other educational resources.

If you own or rent a home with a backyard and would like to have neighbors who want to remove or change fences and share parts of their backyards (or if you already have shared backyard space and want to notify interested people when a home on your block becomes available for sale or rent), please see the &quot;Blocks with Potential&quot; page at BackyardNeighborhoods.org.

And if you would like to buy or rent a home on a block where there are residents who want to share parts of their backyards, you can contact us to be added to an announcement list. Please be specific about which area(s) you are interested in, such as a city, region, state, or country. Whenever someone tells us about property for sale or rent in a block where a resident wants to share backyard space, we will make an announcement to the people who are interested in that area.

Also, please contact us if you hear of two or more houses next to each other for sale or rent at the same time, on any block. We will then contact the people who are interested in that area.

The founders of this group live in San Francisco, but we also want to help create backyard neighborhoods in other areas.

We will never sell or rent any email address, and we won't give your email address to anyone except a person or group you ask us to give it to (for example, you might want to have your email address given to other people who would like to share backyards in particular areas).

      <name>Piscataquis Village Project</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21777&quot;&gt;Piscataquis Village Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; compact, car-free&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/piscataquis-village-project/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/piscataquis-village-project/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
This proposal is to create a compact, car-free, village of 125 acres, on a site totaling 500 acres in southern Piscataquis County, Maine, USA. Development of the site would be guided by a set of zoning and building covenants specifically composed to create a space, as it is built out, to resemble traditional villages of Europe and early North America, in which foot or bicycle was the primary or sole method of transportation. This site would be declared a car-free zone. Motor vehicles would be parked at the perimeter of the development in a green belt of at least 375 acres, which would also be acquired as part of this project. The green belt, other than the area designated for vehicle parking, would also be a zone for allotment gardens, small scale agriculture, playing fields, outdoor recreation and park-like green space. 

In place of building ordinances, typical of most areas, which require setbacks from the edges of the lot, would be &quot;zero-lot line&quot; ordinances making for connected buildings with common walls that front directly on the sidewalk. Streets would be narrower and human scaled. Buildings would have a 4 story height limitation and be constructed in such a way as to create arcaded, covered sidewalks. Small squares or plazas would be set through the development, which would become neighborhood centers and meeting places.

The site would be defined as a medium density, residential/mixed use development allowing an average density of 35 to 50 building lots per acre. Buildings, due to their close proximity to each other (typically town house /row house style), would be of masonry construction to meet a strict fire-proof standard. Ordinances typical of Maine towns requiring car parking spaces for businesses and residences would not be required, and commercial space on the ground floor of residences would be allowed and encouraged.

Our vision is modest: to secure a site, obtain regulatory approval for a medium density/ mixed used development, map out a basic physical structure of streets, plazas and building lots, compose a set of building covenants appropriate to a human scaled, car-free settlement, and let it organically, incrementally evolve. Those people or groups of people that wish to pursue their own, various versions of the Good Life within the bounds of the Village are welcome.

At present, we have &quot;contingent investment&quot; pledges from 42 households totaling $475,000.

We are currently a community of six member households and three households interested in membership, living close to the land on 135 acres of mixed woodland and pasture. We range in age from infant to 60s, with 15 adults and 14 children. We strive to live spirit-focused lives that are simple, sustainable, and joyful, benefiting from and enjoying our close connections with each other and the land. We don't all need to identify explicitly as Quaker. We welcome diversity of all sorts.

We are in the gorgeous Hudson Valley of upstate New York (2.5 hours from NYC/Boston, 10 minutes from our local Quaker Meeting), in the foothills of the Berkshires.

We are thriving in a range of green homes that use technologies including plastered strawbale walls, slip-and-chip walls, stick-building, timber-framing, passive solar design, solar hot-water systems, and wood heat; many of us built our own. Many of us farm small plots organically, raise chickens and livestock, and eat increasingly more from what we grow. We join together in our big farmhouse for weekly potlucks, occasional community dinners hosted by one or more households, community workdays, committee meetings, spontaneous game nights and tea times, presentations on topics of interest, and monthly community business meetings.  We use Quaker processes including consensus decision-making that seeks God's will, discernment, and the clearness process, and we value equality, simplicity, and diversity of experience and viewpoints.

We are currently seeking new members!  Starting late summer 2014 there will be a 1,500-sq ft house available for sale to a new member household.  The house is initially available for rent in order to allow time for discernment about membership.  (See pictures of red house in photo gallery below.)  We also have one house building site available, with the possibility of two more in the future if there is need.   Our membership process starts with a mutual getting-t0-know-each-other time, during which the potential member or member family gets involved with the community in various ways and gets to know us (and vice-versa).  This often takes up to a year.  The goal is to come to a sense of clearness, for the applicant as well as the community members, about whether the fit is a good one.  More about our membership process can be found on our web site (http://qivc.org/faq-qivc#Participation).

We believe conscious culture creation in community can be a means to advance our intentions:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To live in worship, increasing our mindfulness, spiritual focus, and God-centeredness by intertwining our daily lives with others who share these intentions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create a village setting that values and engages participation by people of all ages, expands our experience of family, and supports our expression in the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create wealth that embodies integrity and Truth by carefully examining our engagement in the current economic order and stepping away from its destructive elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To live in unity &amp;amp; harmony with the earth by considering the near and far environmental impact of our actions while striving for thrivability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To include a good measure of joy, fun, creativity, and service in our lives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
We believe that our communities' success in achieving these five intentions will be aided by memberships diverse in race, age, ethnicity, sexual preference, and economic situations, and therefore it is our aim to gather communities whose members are diverse in these ways as well as others.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21779&quot;&gt;Providence Zen Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; residential Zen practice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/providence-zen-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/providence-zen-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Providence Zen Center is a residential spiritual community founded in 1972 by the Korean Zen Master Seung Sahn to provide a place where his students could live and practice Zen together.  In 1979 we moved to our current location about 20 minutes from the heart of Providence in rural Cumberland RI. 

Most residents work outside the community and pay a monthly training fee (currently $675).  This fee covers all primary living expenses (room, food, utilities).  Food is bought and shared by the community, and community meals are cooked for the community several times a week on a primarily volunteer basis.  The remainder of meals are prepared individually. Our spiritual practice is modeled after the practices of the Korean Zen tradition.  Zen meditation practice consisting of sitting meditation, chanting, and bowing is offered twice daily in the early morning and evening, and residents are encouraged to practice together daily as their work schedule permits.  In addition, residents may attend monthly weekend retreats as well as longer retreats held twice yearly in the summer and winter:  these retreats are available to residents at no additional cost.  We also have a large non-residential community which visits the center to attend practice, retreats, or other community events, and we offer our hospitality to other spiritual groups which rent our facilities to host their own retreats.  

As a community we are committed to working towards greater sustainability.  To this end we are transitioning to purchasing as much organic and local food as our budget allows, growing some of our own produce in the garden and greenhouse, and keeping chickens to help provide eggs for the community.  We have installed low watt florescent fixtures and bulbs throughout the buildings. We are also working to retrofit the buildings to make heating in the winter more energy efficient. Last fall we replaced the remaining single pane windows in the original wings of the building with energy star rated replacement windows. In addition to this, we work to foster greater connection with the wider spiritual community through participation in ecumenical and interfaith groups, and have hosted interfaith retreats.
&lt;/div&gt;

We exist as a Christ-centered, egalitarian intentional community in Birmingham, AL pursuing pillars of hospitality, nonviolence, discipleship and simplicity in our neighborhood of East Lake.

Micah's House was birthed out of an artistic collective called Emuna. Through Emuna we began our journey of pursuing a consistent life ethic, confronting the challenging parts of our unexamined lives and making decisions in order to embody the faith we all claim. Six of us moved into a huge house on the Southside of town but through many transformative experiences that have challenged virtually every part of us, individually and communally, we have settled and started to grow roots in East Lake, Birmingham. In September 2012 we acquired a house in South East Lake, and in April of 2013 we dedicated the Ambrose/Sales House to the work of the community in memory of our friends, Rick Ambrose and Dick Sales - both tireless advocates for peace and justice in Birmingham and around the world.

As part of our shared life together, each week we set aside Monday and Thursday nights for community dinner at 7:00 PM - all are welcome. Additionally, on Saturday evenings, as we are able, we peace vigil with a group of veteran peacemaker friends in Birmingham's 5 Points South at 5PM, followed by dinner at New China Town at 6PM. Frequently we partner with PHADP, JAM, Pax Christi, Mary's House, Arise, ACIJ and GBM in pursuit of justice for all Alabamians.

At times Micah's House has consisted of as many as eight adults and three children living and sharing a common life together. At present, the community is in a time of transition as the majority of community members are in the process of pre-arranged moves necessitated by previous commitments and future endeavors. As a result, we have space available for new short-term and long-term residents and those interested in pursuing our life together. For more information, read through &quot;Our Life Together&quot; (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1DVcWj3bhSDUnpJVFdFWGZjVWs/edit?usp=sharing) if you feel you may be interested in connecting with us. Also, check out the &quot;Rule&quot; tab of our website, where you can find our communal commitments, our shared values and vision documented. In essence we seek to holistically embody the gospel: loving God, loving each other, loving our neighbor.

Visitors are welcome, if you are interested in coming please contact us at community@micahshouse.com.

Cultural diversity with spiritual consciousness is essential - welcoming each other with respect, kindness, learning and understanding.  This also includes people of all ages and abilities, and of any economic status.

Living and working together in community is a spiritual practice, where co-operation means with each other... and with guidance from each person's inspiration (co-operation with spirit, as any artist knows), and then also verified by consensus among members of the community.  Depending on viewpoint, there are no leaders, or everyone is a co-leader.

Each person's time is equally valuable, by definition.  Maximum 'free' time for healing &amp;amp; creative work.  Minimal overhead of all types, including community meetings &amp;amp; chores.

Ecological appropriate technology, and off-grid independence from conventional 'resources'.

Proposed resident population of 10 to 50, including students, with additional capacity for hundreds of visitors during public events.  Non-resident membership is limited by the size of the universe.

Proposed community resources, projects, businesses - theatre &amp;amp; art gallery, restaurant &amp;amp; bakery, greenhouse, gardens &amp;amp; housing around the community.

Proposed experiential 'non-school' open educational environment - including music/dance/theatre, media-art production, ecological &amp;amp; appropriate technology, holistic health...

Ringing Cedar Project is a community of like minded individuals who are inspired by permaculture principle of gardening explained Sepp Holzer, and those who are interested in developing and nourishing vital cultural values as inspired by Vladimir Megre’s vision.

We are seeking active, passionate and motivated people to form a real life kin’s domain settlement in British Columbia Region. Many people who join us are business people, so on sight job opportunities may be available. We are working together with one common goal in mind, to create bright prosperous future for many generations to come.

We are committed to living closer to the natural world…in harmony with nature and more lightly on the earth using sustainable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/tierraluz/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/tierraluz/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;In these times....It's time to do it differently...
Stewarding a Refuge from the pace and patterns of business as usual...  
Practicing and Inspiring lighter footprints on the earth

Earth Built * Sun Powered

We are committed to living closer to the natural world…
in harmony with nature and more lightly on the earth using sustainable technologies.

    SUN:  solar power, solar hot water, solar clothes dryers(!)
    WIND: wind power, enhanced natural ventilation
    EARTH: Natural building techniques, organic  gardening,  permaculture
    WATER:  Natural well water, gray water recycling, harvesting rainwater
AND…more to enjoy:
    Ocean Views, Jungle Views, Pastoral Views
    Regularized Titled lots and,Titled community land
    Solar powered off grid well and 20,000 Liters community water storage
    Common Land: shared open space (almost 9,000 m2!) including organic farmland, food forest, jungle trails, meditation vistas
    Beautiful wooden 15m2 yoga deck on the highest ground and best view for all to enjoy.
    Superadobe Community Storage/Bodega 12m2

We are an Eco-focused off-grid neighborhood set up co-housing style with private ownership of lots and common land co-owned via a Mexican Civil Association of which we are all members. We have beautiful land in Sayulita, Mexico, a fun, lively, small town north of Puerto Vallarta.  We have a good well, solar system for pumping the water,  water distributed to the lots, community water storage, roads ,trails, food forests, great sun for solar and already have 14 adults and 5 kids involved…It’s happening!  We have 6 lots left out of a total of 17. Seven houses have been built, 5 half of them with earthen building techniques such as Cob or Superadobe/Earthbag and local wood fired brick. The weather is fabulous, the skies are clear and blue most all year and there is great surf and swimming at the beach in Sayulita, a 20 minute walk or 5 min drive away.

VISION: A community of neighbors where there is a shared interest and commitment to using less 
resources, producing less waste, producing our own renewable energy, and enjoying a more tranquil and 
sustainable life that enhances health and well being. We share land/open space that holds possibilities for 
growing food, gathering with friends, walking, sitting or practicing yoga in nature at a beautiful meditation 
vista. Our homes are modest sized, ideally built with natural materials such as compressed earth blocks, 
cobb, adobe, bamboo, etc, that are easier on the environment than more processed materials such as cement. 
We each have incorporated sustainable technologies such as photovoltaics, wind power, solar 
hot water heating, low impact development, grey water recycling, rainwater harvesting, composting toilets, 
etc. Living this way, perhaps we may be closer to the suggestion by Mahatma Gandhi to, “Be the change you 
wish to see in the world”. 

TONE: Smile!...It’s Mexico! Let it go...Relax! Tranquilo! Find your gratitude and let it be known. Ask periodically, “How can I do this with a lighter footprint?” Also, take the time to pause, breathe, sit in nature listen and let the sacred land speak to us.

*The more shades of green the better!
**Inspired by some of the Mexican culture of tolerance, we invite this quality to be central to giving respectful space to one's neighbors differences.
*We have a community sacred space on the top of the land...a place for reverence of nature and meditation, yoga, etc.
*Private International Green School  and Public school nearby</description>

      <name>Jewel Creek Organic Farm &amp; Ecovillage</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21785&quot;&gt;Jewel Creek Organic Farm &amp; Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; An Agriculturally based Ecovillage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/jewel-creek-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/jewel-creek-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are a family of 4 (Oliver, 33, Meike, 38, Emil, 5 and Eva 2), seeking connection to the land and community. We value sustainability and want to live a satisfying, healthy and creative life. We bought a piece of property with the intent of starting an organic farm and forming an ecovillage. We moved to Jewel Creek in May 2012, started renovating an existing log house and building our homestead. 
We would like to invite like-minded people in our age group (20s-40s) to inquire, help out, learn and perhaps join and create a wonderful interdependent community with us.
 
THE PROPERTY: It's located only minutes north of Greenwood and only an hour from Osoyoos, 142 acres with Jewel Creek running through it as well as at least one artisian spring. It has great sun exposure, good top soil and is big enough for several families to live on self sufficiently. It has crown land on 3 sides and trails all around. Less than 2 km to Jewel Lake. 

OUR PLAN:
We are planning to build a cluster of natural homes designed to minimize ecological disturbance and maximize use of the fertile, previously cleared areas for organic farming and gardening. We will use building material sourced from our land as much as possible. 
We are already producing our own solar power and are going to set up hydro systems.
Grey water will be treated naturally and used for irrigation. Composting toilets will provide humanure for some gardens and plants. 
We would like to host workshops, retreats, and small festivals related to sustainability, music and the arts, We hope that this will not only be fun and social but also bring the community some income for improvements, bills and further development.
We want to consume food that is produced locally, ideally on our own farm, but always sustainably. Our organic farm will supply residents and visitors with fresh, organic food; surplus can be sold on local farmer's markets (twice a week in Grand Forks), through the food co-op, through CSAs and to restaurants in the area. 
We would like to invite people to join who have some of the skills and experience in community living, natural building, establishing off-grid energy systems, permaculture, organic farming, educational programs and/or are simply and wonderfully handy, hardworking, hands-on folks. 
If you are an Anti-vaxxer, believe that the government is poisoning us with Chemtrails, very religious, a conspiracy theorist, a &quot;Freeman on the land&quot;, anti-science, or the like... if this is you... you need not apply. This is a place for practical, hard working, rational, freethinkers who enjoy life, being active and healthy, believe in sustainability and that a green revolution is needed and feel it is better to be prepared for an uncertain future (as best as we can be) than to pretend like everything is ok and be totally unprepared.

Innovate, creative, motivated individuals looking to start off-the-grid sustainable eco-village in Upstate NY with in 2 hrs. of NYC focusing on permaculture design principles and green building techniques. Emphasis on individual privacy and community cooperation. Additional community land shared.

We're looking for land now and getting in touch with future community members at this time. We are looking at land near a larger city or town, between 40-100 acres (or more if possible) mixed meadows and forest, stream. Projected 20-50 individuals or families. Allocation of acerage per family to make an individual homestead for growing food and building your home. Size and style of home as well as paying for your home is at your own discretion. Community organization will assist in finding affordable and sustainable housing options. Common land includes meadow shared for animals and orchards ie.  

I've looked at other intentional communities and I feel many of them lack natural beauty of design and lack incorporation with the natural environment.  

Ground rules will be decided in consensus with community members similar to a co-op community. Depending on the location chosen, houses would be as off-the-grid as possible, using passive solar design, natural building options and permaculture principles without sacraficing too many modern comforts and technology. Members with skills in green building and alternative energy technology are especially appreciated. 

The intention is to form a community of like-minded individuals who can offer a diversity of skills and backgrounds to create a society for the modern world. A place where abundant organic food is available, where we can live in harmony with nature as well as be able to reach our potential as human beings.
Looking for land NOW. Be part of the process!
Please email me with any questions and feel free to tell me about yourselves.

We are something very old renewed. Located in the Catskill Mountains of Upstate New York, we have slightly over three acres of land, a 120+ year old former resort inn and building towards as much self sufficiency as we can.

We are a community of Goddess spiritual oriented women, are incorporated as a 501C3 religious charitable organization and we are trying to build a new/old way of living as a community.  If that sounds good, contact us.

We have a full ceramics studio, adding looms and other handicrafts.  We have an in house movie theatre. Living here means sharing the expenses and work to maintain our property and doing so in a Goddess oriented manner.  We are located in a tiny hamlet so having your own car is a definite plus.

If you are interested, come spend a week with us so we can see if we all mesh.  All sexual orientations are welcome and we are transsexual positive but you must be fully transitioned and woman identified.  Men are welcome to visit and often do.  We are very feminist oriented, service oriented and social justice oriented.

You do not have to be a member of our religious tradition to live here but should be comfortable with it.  No dogs, multiple kitty residents.  There is an outdoor Temple/Grove in the back and a generic Pagan style circle as well as a small dome available for retreats

Blessed Be, We have a website www.thehedgecommunity.com The Hedge is a Pagan community between around Hutchinosn, ks. We are on 30 acres half wooded and half pasture. There are some outbuildings now and a creek. We are tied to the grid, until we have a well and enough solar power installed. We welcome all ages, &amp;amp; beliefs. We have one room in tha main house available. And we also have the loft in the barn large with electric and we will be putting in wood heaters soon. Individual cabins will be built and exisiting buildings will be renovated for housing. We share meals, celebrate holidays, and plan outings together. We grow organic all natural gardens and will be supported in a few years by our tree farm. Right now we work as a community cleaning forclosed homes in the local area. Each community member works two days a week doing this. The rest of the time we work at the community. We use this money to buy items for the community, and food, land payment etc. We also plan on homeschooling as a community, including monthly trips to museums and such. Doing things as a community is very important to us. We are tired of working for $ to buy plastic or electronic gadgets that simulate life. We want to LIVE life, love, laugh, eat, dance, sing and all the rest. We have seen others comments about handing over there assets when joining a community. We do not want your money, or assets. What you have when you join us is yours. But you will not have much use for it here lol. We will be buying hygiene products that we do not make ourselves as a group. There will be co housing as well as individual cabins are possible. We require natural building, using natural materials or reclaimed materials as often as possible. We have many animals and will soon have more. Cats, dogs, goats, ducks, chickens and more. You must be respectful of them and there right to be at the community. Many of us are vegetarians. You do not have to be one to live here. But there will be no killing of animals here. The meat eaters buy meat in bulk from organic sources. We make decisions as a group, with founding members making decisions in disputes. We want this to be like and extended family. Two of us are poly, this does not mean we sleep with everyone. Or anyone outside of our committed relationship. Gay or bi people are accepted as is everyone regardless of sexuality. Most of us are Pagan and celebrate nature as well as Yule, Samhain etc. Call 316-371-5732

      <name>Allegheny Crest Intentional Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21792&quot;&gt;Allegheny Crest Intentional Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Integrating community with the larger world; creating change *in* people that leads to critical social change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/allegheny-crest-intentional-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/allegheny-crest-intentional-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Allegheny Crest Intentional Village is a unique approach to combining social change, personal growth, rural revitalization, and ecological sensitivity.  Located in the West Virginia Potomac Highlands, 100 miles west of Washington DC, with spectacular mountain settings and crisp, clean air, our land currently includes a retreat center with 20 acres of lush, pristine river valley, and 3 acres of mountaintop with four houses, a 24-unit motel, and a general store.

Like many other intentional communities, Allegheny Crest is based in humanistic values, equality of opportunity, social action, personal growth, and compassionate service.  What makes us a village, and not only a community, is active outreach, local integration, radical acceptance, and porous membership:

Active Outreach:  We regularly have events that bring in a wide range of people, and these events change lives! Participants have said: “‘normal’ is not normal anymore”; “opening doors that I didn't even know existed”; “truly people who accepted me unconditionally”; “I fell in love with myself!”  (We jokingly say that we measure success by how many people go home and quit their jobs.)  Whatever skills you have can be used to help create these amazing spaces.  They make magic!

Local Integration: We reach out to those who already live nearby, providing services, working with them, playing with them, building connections in whatever ways work best, and becoming an integral part of the local people’s lives. 

Radical Acceptance.  People who would never think of discriminating on skin color or gender often unconsciously discriminate against people with different verbal styles, work patterns, thought processes, or priorities.  Discovering these blind spots and creating a welcoming environment for *all* people is a core part of our work in the world.

Porous Membership.  Many communities have a strong line between members and non-members, have strict limits on visitors, and a structured membership process—all within the context of defined property lines.  Membership at Allegheny Crest can take any form that human relationships can take, from client or casual acquaintance to event participant to short-term volunteer to full residential membership—and individuals can shift their relationship as their own needs and growth require.  Because we practice Radical Acceptance, this includes accepting that an individual’s relation to the community can change however it needs to without breaking that connection.  Porous membership allows people to connect in many ways that allow for mutual benefit for the person and the community.  This also spreads the community’s influence and connections much more widely.

We are also distinctive in our approach to governance and to abundance:

Compassionate Anarchy.  Rather than needing group approval for every initiative, each person has full authority to act on their own—and the responsibility to discern who will be affected and how to incorporate their concerns.  Compassionate anarchy fosters individual initiative, allows greater personal freedom, and replaces centralized control with a dynamic negotiation process.

Abundance.   Subsistence living is often seen as a value or necessity in community living.  We value and support abundance in every aspect of life: emotions, economics, energetics, social connections, personal freedom, and time.

If you are an independent-minded and energetic person who wants an intimate community while contributing to cutting-edge social change, you may find your home with us. 

Many of us have connected through New Culture experiences: workshops, open houses, weekend events, and ten-day summer camps. There are intentional communities and businesses across the country and beyond that have been built on New Culture insights; here, we are taking it to a new level.

Our existing businesses form the economic base for the village.  The work is quite varied, and includes every aspect of producing, managing, maintaining, and improving these businesses, properties, events, activism, and educational programs. 

Play and connection are also core and conscious activities; *balance* is a primary goal.

Members can select a living environment that best suits their needs:  resident on one of our properties, member of a group house, or living in a separate house or apartment that they rent or own.  Residents who choose to be part of the core economic base are provided with room and board (and medical care in many cases), as well as assistance in creating independent income opportunities.

Because there are no zoning restrictions and no building code restrictions, Allegheny Crest is an ideal location for using alternative construction techniques, land use, energy generation and management, sustainable design, and much more.  We already have a geothermal heating and cooling system for the motel, and geodesic domes for large group meeting spaces; we are excited about exploring other projects that move us more towards sustainability.</description>

Welcome to Saraswati Ahimsa Vana… a hidden paradise in the Amazon Jungle that words cannot describe.  We are community followers of vedic principles starting up an organic farm and nature reserve to protect part of the Amazon rainforest and the animals within.  Our goal is to teach our foreign visitors and Ecuadorian neighbours about simple living, high thinking.

At the current moment we are reforesting 26 hectares (approximately 60 acres) of secondary rainforest with native plants and trees from the Amazon, returning natural feeding grounds to the hunted animals.  We are in the process of forming a legitimate Ecuadorian foundation to offer a haven to the surrounding Amazon wildlife.

Transcendent Seeds of Paradise is an emerging eco-village and artistic community designed to facilitate sustainable, innovative, fun and inspiring ways of living and evolving.  This endeavor aims to help individuals and communities transition away from the exploitive, consumptive, toxic, dominator, and self destructive relationships with each other and nature in which our culture and our species is currently entangled. This lifestyle will increase individual leisure time by reducing the need for monetary income while also providing optimal opportunities for a wide variety of social, recreational, creative, educational, technological, artistic and spiritual activities. Rather than an organization that only provides information, classes and workshops to help people transition towards a more sustainable lifestyle, this project will allow and encourage people to very easily actually experience and participate in these lifestyles, for as long as they like. Transcendent Seeds of Paradise endeavors will be geared towards local self reliance as well as building networks of supportive interdependence. Long term goals will be to create a network of eco-village/eco-communities/sanctuaries/eco-resorts that will be designed to maximize individual and community life enjoyment, fulfillment, health, self expression and self growth. This alliance will experiment, develop, practice, integrate, and teach ways of living which will help individuals and other communities to transition towards more sustainable, ecologically benevolent, healthy, creative, fun and beautiful ways of co-evolving. This community will also be a template and resource for a wide diversity of innovative lifeways that will provide a safety net to enable individuals, families, communities, cultures and countries to survive through various upcoming ecological, economical, political, and cultural challenges and changes.

We are re-purposing a 70s motel and are fortunate to have inherited several lovely community spaces - a large kitchen, common room, spa and sauna, tennis courts and bbq area.   The land is undulating with diverse natural features.  
Just an hour and a quarter from Tasmania's capital city, Hobart, we are surrounded by beaches, forest and magnificent scenery.  We are five minutes walk from the centre of Nubeena, where there are many services: district school to year 10, police and emergency services, doctor, chemist, post office, two supermarkets and a tavern.  
We have a vision of a way of life that - 
●	 affirms our understanding that we are an integral part of nature, respects all beings, and treads more lightly on the Earth,
● 	acknowledges the traditional custodians of the land and the rich diversity of our own ancestral histories,
●	is resilient and able to adapt to a changing world,
●	is sustainable ecologically, socially and economically,

We’re a group of people who view living in a community as something more than just being room-mates. We are looking for people – families or individuals who share our vision of co-creating a sustainable community home together.

We eat together and share in many of the household chores and expenses of living. Moreover, each house member is committed to raising his/her individual consciousness and, in doing so, developing the vitality, strength and intimacy of relationships among the whole group. Our purpose is to grow together, parent together and live together in laughter, joy and even in our suffering.

What we are offering is a system where each member participates in the communal responsibilities of the household
	Each member participates in one weekly house meeting where we dialogue about interpersonal relationships, resolve conflicts and take care of logistical matters	
        Each member takes care of the children of the house for 10 hours/month to promote a culture of healthy attachment and mentorship for children 
        Cooks or prepars a vegan meal once a week so that everyone can participate
	In addition to rent, pays an extra $180/month toward the grocery kitty, and $25 for a wear-and-tear fund 
        Takes on average two house chores a week 

Currently, there are two owners of the house who are still in the role of landlords and rent is paid to them for a room, gas, hydro and internet.

Some of the texts that have been helpful in guiding us in our endeavor are: “On Dialogue” by David Bohm, “Getting the Love You Want” by Harville Hendrix, “Concious Loving” by Gay and Kathlyn Hendricks, “The Anatomy of Peace” by the Arbinger Institute, “The Continuum Concept” by Jean Liedloff,  “Hold on to Your Kids” by Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Mate, “Free at Last” – the Sudbury Valley model of free and democratic education, the work of M. Scott Peck on community, the work of A.H. Almaas on spirituality and, most recently, “The Presence Process” by Michael Brown

(Please note: none of us are extremists and we haven’t all read these books – we share in our knowledge and practice with each other and respect the different paths each of us are on and the different ways each of us learn to come to higher levels of concsiousness and closeness with each other).

Urban Ecology Australia (UEA)is a non-profit, community-based organisation, promoting people-and-nature-friendly urban settlements.
Ecological Cities. The eco-village associated with UEA is known as Christie Walk

An eco-city is a city in balance with nature. We can make eco-cities here and now by incorporating energy and water conservation features in buildings, industry and transport, and by cultivating natural ecosystems and human communities in urban public spaces.



Christie Walk is a medium density housing development located in downtown Adelaide which combines many ecologically sustainable and community enhancing features. It was initiated by UEA and serves as a demonstration site to show how cities could be built.

Our plan has developed and been refined over the years as we moved from a &quot;hobby&quot; to a serious project.  Now, we believe the plan is mature and ready to be put into action.
The plan involves a &quot;proprietary community&quot;, an &quot;Improvement District&quot; and a &quot;Special Taxing District&quot;.
This is a successful plan.  It dates back to 1966 when an Improvement District and Special Taxing District for the formation of the Reedy Creek Improvement District were created.
The District has control over water, waste disposal, airport facilities, transportation, public utilities, and roads - the civic goods normally provided by cities and counties.
And just who is the Reedy Creek Improvement District?
You may have already visited there...
Walt Disney Corporation (WDC) owns 98% of the land in the District, thus controlling the Improvement District.
Yes... Walt Disney World.
Walt Disney World, the world-famous resort, is a proprietary community, a corporation running a retail community and transient residential communities.
This is the basis of our plan.  We plan to seek a similar arraingement with the government of Texas to facilitate our &quot;propietary community&quot; and &quot;corporate business venture&quot;.
Everything else is &quot;costuming&quot; for a community built from the ground up to be sane, sustainable, and human.
We welcome everyone to investigate us!  We may be odd, but sometimes the best idea is that oddest one!

Simone Weil and Peter Maurin House – Monastic (Catholic Worker’s “Little Monastery”) of a non-dogmatic  and  non-denominational  orientation;
founded  and  established between 2009 -2011.

&quot;a Library of books and films – in a House of Silence&quot;  -  which provides environment for inner work towards  living in true communion with God; in  His  Truth  about  life,  reality  and  the  world.  (Repentance, prayer, Knowledge, inner healing.)
Simple –“of old way”- life in the House (and learning it). A small garden.

The purpose of this House is
-  to further the aims and goals of the Catholic Worker movement as expressed by Dorothy Day and, particularly, as expressed by Peter Maurin;
-  to join in works and efforts of the newly established (in 2004) New Monastic
Movement    (please check:  NewMonasticism.org);
-  to follow in the footsteps of the Madonna Houses (founded by Catherine de Hueck Doherty;  and as expressed by her in the book ”Pustinia”)
-  to learn  about, draw from-and follow- the examples of the other deeply rooted in God spiritual/ religious monastic or life-communities; - the ancient Essenes, or the Bruderhof, or Amish and Hutterites;
-  to live as one unique small monastic community
          as a response to God’s call – for repentance and  &quot;conversion&quot;;  and then for living a way of love -  which will bring fruits of truth, justice, and peace.

If you are interested in our mission,  inquire about the situation by calling and coming for few days-to two weeks  of  orientation.
In  the beautiful  House-setting  there  is  a  room  for  one  person  for  a  longer-term stay (half-a-year to  a  year  or  more),  and  a room  for one - for a shorter-term stay .

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21801&quot;&gt;Ekobius Ecovillage (Ecology Crossroads)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Through cooperation, peace and the natural world we can realize our genuine purpose as the caretakers of the planet. Our community is dedicated to the using appropriate ecological technology, natural materials, harnessing the energy of nature, and benefiting from its gifts. Our focus as a group is on ecosystem services, their protection, development and sharing for ourselves and future generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ekobius-ecology-crossroads/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ekobius-ecology-crossroads/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Come live in the Upper Amazon and Orinoco Mountains, on the Guiana Shield where it all began! 

It took us several years to find the right property and have overcome the invisible socio political factions that mysteriously exist trying to prevent our Indie-pendent Ideals. &quot;Now our property is finally paid off and we can begin moving in&quot; David Wright, Project Coordinator.

In May 2013 we entered into a contract to purchase property at the frontier edge where the Amazon Rainforest meets the Guiana Highlands, locally they call it Guayana, we call it the Amazon Highlands. We started using Ekobius (Ecology-By-Us) to describe the special niche ecosystem and area where we live and are building a prototype model ecological village based on open-source ideals. This is deep ecology and nature at its best!

As of October 2018 we are beginning a reformation ecovillage, installing our own idealist eco-permaculture and sustainable intentional community! For the first time since we began planning and purchase in 2013, the property can now be occupied and has finally been prepared well-enough to accommodate visitors and begin the development of our modern example eco-community.

Located in Venezuela's Northern Amazon; literally, at the 'End of the Road.' our property is the absolute last property that can be inhabited permanently by other than traditional indigenous peoples before entering a protected land area of 650,000 square kilometers full of indigenous reservations, natural monuments, national parks and biosphere reserves. Cross the river behind our property and the next contact with civilization you will find is a 100 day hike due south to the Amazon River or due east to Mt. Roraima and the Guyana, Venezuela, Brazil border. 

We are 33 kilometers (20 miles) from the capital of the state of Amazonas, Puerto Ayacucho, which is in the Atures municipal district. Our ecovillage is located on an asphalt connector road with the capital, we are located between the local community of La Culebra and the indigenous community called Gavilan at Kilometer 24 on Via Gavilan. Public bus transit is available within 10 kilometers of our property. The front of our property has 800 m of road frontage and nearly 2 km of frontage on the Catañiapo River.

Our project is owned and operated by the Ekobius International (an International Cooperative) who are the member residents of our eco-village (ecovillage) development. The property, its infrastructure, and its buildings are wholly owned and controlled by the cooperative under express indefinite permission with the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands. 

Anyone can become a member of Ekobius by investing in the socio-productive cooperative, anyone can further become a resident of our intentional community (ecovillage) and work in the cooperative by joining the cooperative and visiting us with a backpack or a suitcase.

We are seeking open minded people that consider themselves free and liberated of capitalism and the mainstream society. We are unifying ourselves differently than most communities because our common bond is not religious or political, spiritualist or governmental; our ideals are based on indigenous knowledge, enhancing nature and fostering the earth's ecology, instead of exploiting it. We are developing as a small ecological community dedicated to sustainable development and the enhancement of our natural environments. Taking care of the planet that takes care of us. 

Resident members can work in agroforestry, permaculture, teaching ecology, growing medicinal plants, making artisan products, developing handicrafts and through the social production of ecosystem services and non-wood forest resources through specialized educational development projects sponsored by international patrons in the Guiana Highlands and Northern Amazon regions. 

We embrace barter and the Pachamama (Mother Earth or Gaia) if that is considered a religious faith.

Resident cooperators are paid for their individual work production and cooperatively through the net production of the coop as well. The cooperative ownership assures fair trade practices. 

Our project is beginning with a property that has a common kitchen building, a four room lodge, a 5 stall bath house, several concrete foundations and 2 chicken coups.</description>

We began when a group of people from the university community came together to talk about te lack of affordable housing in College Park. Demand for student housing drives up rent in neighborhoods surrounding UMD, and a large transient population fractures the sense of community in these neighborhoods. While the university was busy building more dorms and developers were constructing luxury high-rise apartments along Route 1, CHUM was imagining what an autonomous alternative would look like. We wanted to avoid renting from the university, corporations that own large apartment complexes, or single-family property owners who often charge high rents for a small supply of poorly-maintained properties. Instead, we want to independently own and manage our own properties. These co-ops allow for affordable higher-density living and the maintenance of a community despite transient populations. This enables university affiliates and other residents to be able to coexist peacefully, share in greater responsibilities and freedoms like setting our own rent, establishing a sustainable culture, and interacting with our neighbors in a positive way. We welcome those interested in the concept of cooperative living and ownership to find ways to make a true co-op in College Park a reality.</description>

Nashville is growing and expanding and the number of people now desiring cohousing is increasing.  The first community was formed, built and the community moved into it in 2015.  Others are now forming in different parts of the city.  As a result of the first community development New American Villages was formed to assist new community starts up to see actual fruition of their dream.  And is partnering with several groups in the area who have interest.  A group from the West side of Nashville is actively looking for land along I-40 from Nashville to Bellevue for a suburban community.  And another group is considering other parts of the city.  There has been discussion about both senior cohousing and multi-generational cohousing.  And there's a desire for affordability.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21805&quot;&gt;Sadhana Forest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Reforestation, personal growth and water conservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sadhana-forest/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sadhana-forest/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our main project is the reforestation of 70 acres of severely eroded land. We are working to re- create the Tropical Dry Evergreen Forest indigenous to our area. This forest type is found only in Southern India and Sri Lanka and provides a rare biological richness due to its very high species abundance (over 1000 species of trees, shrubbery and liana). The Tropical Dry Evergreen Forest is now close to total extinction as only 0.01% survives. This is a last moment effort to keep this very rich and beautiful forest on earth. As part of our reforestation effort we are also working on water conservation and soil management.

Our projects include the work with local children, hosting many groups of people interested in conservation, the UniverCity of Compassion and an animal sanctuary where we care for rescued animals.

We practice an eco-friendly way of life including veganism, alternative construction, solar energy, biodegradable toiletries, and compost toilets
.
Volunteers mainly plant, mulch, and water trees during the season, work on water conservation in the forest and around the community, cook, clean, maintain the community area, and spend time with local and community kids.

Free facilities for volunteers include a small swimming pool, free 24/7 unlimited access to the Internet with your own device, four hours each day of AC power to charge electrical equipment, a small collection of books, the use of several bicycles, and a playground for children. There are also daily workshops offered that are run by our volunteers and vary each week and can be anything from yoga, to Capoeira, to non-violent communication, to arts and crafts, and much much more!

Food and accommodation:
- All meals (vegan) provided
- Accommodation provided
Accommodation for volunteers is in exchange for a 25 hour work week, 5 hours a day, 5 days a week.

This is a nonprofit ecological project that does not generate any income. Therefore, we cannot provide free food for volunteers. We have communal vegan organic meals. We all equally share the cost of the organic food ingredients we purchase. The total cost of food per person (including 3 meals a day) is 500 Indian Rupees per day (just under $8 USD).

This is a 100% vegan environment, so we ask volunteers not to bring or eat any non-vegan food in the forest. A vegan is a person who does not consume any animal products as food. Vegans do not eat meat, fish, eggs, dairy (milk) products, honey, or any other animal products. As vegans we aim to reduce animal suffering, move towards a more sustainable and rational use of land resources, and
reduce the high level of “greenhouse gases” produced by vast numbers of farm animals.</description>

This is a community in the planning stages here in the Tampico, Mexico area. We have a climate which permits year round organic gardening and wonderful solar and wind energy opportunities. I have begun and experimental earth bag cottage in my backyard which will combine recess, straw bale, and earth bottle construction as well. After this I will build a two bedroom cottage at the community site right alongside the Panuco river in the Sate of Veracruz Mexico. It is about 33kms. from the city where I live Tampico. I presently have a large organic garden, raise rabbits, chickens and Mario (Italian) the owner of the land has about 20 cows.

My dream is to have about 20 two bedroom homes of similar construction that folks could live on part-time or full time.
 My son is at this location,
I am in Rama, Saskatchewan, Canada I have a bedroom available for a person interested in visiting for a few months. We are starting plants and animals. 3 1/2 acres of quiet. A three bedroom cabin. All amenities. Furnished. $250 per month if able to work 6/hours daily 5 days per week.we are rolling. My son is here with me and helps a bit. He is a little autistic so needs understanding. We love God and our neighbour, which includes you so drop a line. Thanks.</description>

We currently house almost 50 residents in three houses. Our mission is to foster an economically, ecologically, and socially sustainable society by promoting the value of cooperation and diversity.  We were born in 2007, on Halloween.

Our houses, Helm's Deep, Woodlandia and Middle Earth are all walking distance to the IU-Bloomington campus as well as to the heart of downtown Bloomington. Middle Earth house is owned by our cooperative, while the other two properties are rented. We are a 501(c)3 nonprofit for low-income housing, so we keep all our rent expenses affordable. To accomplish this, we share expenses for food and utilities, driving costs down.

Our membership includes a range of undergraduate, graduate and non-students. We feel that a diverse membership enriches the coop, especially since we practice democratic decision-making at the house- and coop-level. Our coop is active in the local community, ranging from participation in the art and music scene, hosting events in collaboration with other organizations that align with our mission, and sharing our space with volunteer groups like Food Not Bombs.

The farm's name comes from the Better Theory—a belief that every experience brings with it an opportunity for exponential personal growth. 

Through educational programming, artist residencies, gallery showings and events, and an ongoing commitment to sustainable living and community outreach, we strive to apply the Better Theory to all our endeavors while offering the curious an opportunity to expand, grow, and flourish.

Better Farm is also home to betterArts, a 501(c)3 non-profit whose mission is to increase access to the arts through free and low-cost artist residencies, community outreach, performances, gallery openings, festivals, private instruction, and more. The betterArts residency program seeks to provide an opportunity for creative exploration and growth to artists, writers, and musicians within the context of Better Farm's dynamic environment. Residencies are for two weeks, three weeks, or month-long periods. The standards for admission are talent, a clear project proposal, a desire to live and work at Better Farm, and a willingness to have a go at the Better Theory. See www.betterarts.org/residencies for more information.

Better Farm’s Sustainability Education Program runs in one- to three-month intervals and is available to individuals interested in a myriad of sustainability issues. Individuals are given daily chores, readings, and projects to work on, and are embedded from Day One in the local community. Those accepted to the program may visit us during the work week, or stay on-site ($500/month stipend covers food, utilities, and materials): Visit www.betterfarm.org/sustainability-internship for more information.</description>

We are part of an extended family  network of communities for those who recognize that we are currently in the midst of an unprecedented opportunity for spiritual growth and would like to engage with other like-minded individuals in order to greatly accelerate our own, as well as aid in our planet’s, spiritual evolution. We are connected with the nearby Starland Retreat Center/Campground.

Our communities follow Network for New Culture http://ncsocal.webs.com/nc-community-principles and Nonviolent Communication principles.

At this time, we are an expanded retrofit cohousing community. The homes are not directly adjacent but within a one mile radius. We are seeking to retrofit properties adjoining our existing ones into the community. This community is connected with the larger community via Transition Joshua Tree.

Our neighborhood is on a hillside overlooking the downtown area of the village of Joshua Tree, California from the north side. The are consists of small to medium size homes and are very inexpensive by Southern California standards.

Here's some info about the area from the local Chamber of Commerce: 
&quot;Joshua Tree is a community of artists, musicians, working families, businesspeople, telecommuters and retirees. Downtown has four art galleries, a yoga studio, two outfitters, a bakery with a shady courtyard for coffee and wi-fi, beautiful gift shops, great burgers and great vegan fare, even a pizza parlor that dishes up home-cooked Indian food. Saturday morning there's a Certified Farmers Market right in town. 

Joshua Tree is easy to get to: just 30 minutes from Palm Springs and within three hours' drive of Los Angeles, San Diego and Las Vegas. Yet we're very far away. With our other-worldly landscape, starry nights and desert quiet, we call our neighborhood Planet Joshua Tree ... Like Earth, Only Better.&quot;

We are a 3 year old community near Riverside, CA.  Area is suburban/rural mix.  Currently we are several people in one 4 bedroom house.  Houses coming to market for rent or sale are available for co-housing.  We have changed the name from &quot;Sunshine House of Healthy Living&quot; back to &quot;Recovery House for the Inner Child&quot;.  But the general theme is the same.

We focus especially on healthy, sustainable living and personal self-improvement.  Recently, our group has been emphasizing personal recovery work on inner child and codependency.  It has become encouraged for members to visit 12Step program meetings in the area such as ACA and CoDA.  If you are not familiar with them, you can visit www.adultchildren.org and www.coda.org.  That gives us a common language and experience to understand what it is when people are referring to healthy boundaries, working with our feelings, cross-talk, etc.

While not vegetarian, reduced meat is encouraged.  The yard theme is edible landscaping.  We strive for financial stability via conscientious work and business.  We are also open to advanced technology in conformance with our ethics.  Currently, we have no membership dues.  But there is rent, chores and a shared pantry.  At this time, we cannot accommodate workfare, i.e. people will need outside income.

Please see our website for a more in depth review of our philosophy and aims at kondoria.org.

Hello, my name is Judy Lowell and I am creating an intentional community of folks who are looking for something more in life. Chuck, my partner, and I live on one of the few remaining 2 acre parcels in the area and plan to build six custom 1,200 sq ft, two story exceptionally designed small cottage-like healthy homes.

Upper Ridge Cottages will be a cooperative community of like minded people who are environmentally progressive, enjoy walking through the woods, sharing the organic garden with their neighbors and being stewards of the forest and wooded wetlands.

We are looking for interested people to invest in the future and share the adventure.

Enjoy your visit.

Imagine.

Background

Here is some background on how this project began and our vision for the creation of an intentional community which is Upper Ridge Cottages.

My name is Judy Lowell and I have lived at the site for over 35 years. I live with my partner Chuck Webster, who recently retired. I am a Special Education teacher, former board President of the local food cooperative and active Audubon member. Chuck and I have a different vision for this property than the usual boring box-like spec homes built on land that has been stripped of vegetation. We wanted to ensure that when we are gone that wouldn't happen to the land that has become part of who we are.

In 2006, a friend gave us an article about the The Tree House Neighborhood, small green homes being built in Port Townsend, WA. When we saw a few pictures of the homes we knew they were precisely what we had been searching for to build on our land. Designs that were simple and functional as well as charming and nothing exactly like we had seen anywhere.

We arranged to travel to Port Townsend to meet with the architect, Richard Berg, and tour the homes. To our delight, Richard agreed to design the site plan and modify the existing drawings to our specific needs. The owners of the built homes were extremely gracious to allow us to visit them, take photos, pick their brains and bring prospective buyers to see what the actual homes will look like.

Over the next 18 months we had the surveys, soil samples, and the Environmental Impact Report completed on our one acre of wooded wetlands. We had a local civil engineering firm (Insight Engineering) create a design that would incorporate the wooded wetlands into a storm water management plan. We will be using the latest in Low Impact Development technology which will result in a comprehensive storm water management system using rain gardens and 1000 gallon storm water catchment systems for each home.

We had a successful Public Hearing in January 2008 and the commissioner gave us the go ahead on Upper Ridge Cottages. We were all ready to submit our drawings for the building permits when the financial crisis struck. Two years later we are gearing up to get our project moving again.

Chuck and I are committed to the environment, using sustainable materials, low impact development, energy efficiency and small homes. These homes will meet and exceed built green standards but just as important they will form a community.

The Upper Ridge Cottages homes were designed for efficiency. They will use fewer resources to build, be cheaper to heat and less costly to maintain. We plan to buy materials locally if possible and hire from the community we live in.

Chuck and I will become the 7th home in Upper Ridge Cottages and will continue to live in our 1930's country rambler on the property.

We have about 4.5 acres of woods, with several yurts, a few community spaces including large 30' yurt for healing ceremonies and classes, large kitchen for gatherings, crafting reading space and &quot;bedroom yurts&quot; scattered throughout the woods as well as tiny house pads. Our goal is to live sustainably, grow food and provide a living model to inspire people in the form of a healing retreat center.  
For now, we have a growing garden, and various sustainable building projects. We have hosted various gatherings and ceremonies, and find that the land invites prayer and healing. Besides that, we have a yurt company, Laurel Nest Yurts (laurelnest.com), down the road from our community, where we hope to invite shared ownership. Community members can work at Laurel Nest Yurts, participate in sustainable projects or organize healing retreats.
We  enjoy nature, music, crafting, beauty, and healthy local organic foods ... we enjoy sharing space and making progress towards making the land more beautiful and sustainable.
We are open to short and long term members, and would enjoy living with hard working, light hearted and grateful people. Our goals are that the place serves as a source of inspiration, and that everyone who lives with us participates at a high level, possibly investing in its growth and sharing ownership.</description>

The Mac House started in the summer of 2010 and currently has its third group of residential members.   The Mac House was created to serve both the people of Mount Auburn and the members of the intentional community.  

The intent of this community is a combination of a few purposes, however, the main purpose is to ultimately serve the neighborhood while also living a socially and environmentally responsible life.

The objective is to obtain residential members who are currently working in the not for profit sector because it shows they are dedicating their time giving back to society.  The house also provides affordable housing for these tenants while they live in a like-minded housing community.  This house, however, is not exclusively for people working in the not for profit and public service sector, it can be for anyone who truly has the heart to serve others living in a simple way.   This home also has a first floor that is 100% accessible to those with limited mobility.

      <name>Anarres Two Cooperative Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21817&quot;&gt;Anarres Two Cooperative Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To demonstrate the viability of democratic, voluntary, cooperative socialism. But the details of exactly how the community will function will be worked out by the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/anarres-two-cooperative-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/anarres-two-cooperative-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
I’m interesting in a forming a cooperative community based on a voluntary, egalitarian and democratic form of socialism (like a kibbutz) but which allows the members as much personal freedom as possible (people have choices, and they don’t have to agree on every little detail). 

For now, the community is just a primitive camping cooperative (with one member who is rarely there). The easiest way to set up group ownership would be as a company with shareholders, but it would actually be a member owned cooperative. Zoning restricts us to one building or mobile home, which would probably serve as a community building, but since the land is zoned for agriculture/mining/recreation, a dormitory for farm workers (us) would also be possible, apparently. Currently the land is completely undeveloped, with no access to any utilities. The next major improvement would be a well (our neighbor to the west recently had one successfully installed).

At some point, we could try to develop cooperative, worker-owned businesses. I'd like to see it organized so that people could work the number of hours they choose (with some minimum), and then the profits would be shared according to hours worked. You could also work outside the community and share part of your income.

Ursula K. LeGuin wrote about a highly evolved form of such a community in her science fiction novel “The Dispossessed”. Anarres Two would not be an attempt to exactly recreate the society depicted on the planet Anarres in her book, but it’s an interesting vision of a non-hierarchical, cooperative society that can act as an inspiration (and as a warning about things that can go wrong). Cooperative communities like the Zionist kibbutzes and the Anabaptist Hutterite communities have been successful, but they are fairly rigid in their structure and ideology, while Marxist-Leninist states are clearly undemocratic and oppressive. At the other extreme, counter-cultural communes tend to lack a clear focus or long-term vision. I'd like to try to strike a balance.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21819&quot;&gt;Bellyacres - Artistic Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To caretake the land, in the spirit of cooperation, while aspiring towards greater environmental sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bellyacres-artistic-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bellyacres-artistic-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We purchased our 12 acre kipuka “island of trees” in 1987. There are 35 founding members (mostly jugglers and performing artists) from 8 different countries, who met at one of the 19 Hawaiian Juggling festivals. We loved the Big Island of Hawaii enough to decide to live or visit here regularly and organized ourselves to establish a permanent home and performing arts center. 
We bought an abandoned jungle homestead that was overrun by vines and weed trees. Since 1987 we have worked thousands of hours on the land, and have turned a slice of raw jungle into a tropical paradise. Almost all of the work has been done voluntarily and with love. 

Bellyacres has seven houses and 3 cabins for staff, faculty and interns. Typically we are about 20 adults and 6 kids plus 1 or 2 visiting work exchange folks.  Our lives are integrated with several of our neighboring families.

Our organic homestead is focused on exploring location appropriate sustainable agriculture practices. Seasonal crops include, coconuts, breadfruit, mangoes, papayas, avocadoes, bananas, many citrus, soursop, jack fruit, lychee, rambutan, berries, passionfruit and guava. Our greenhouse has the potential to grow a variety of conventional temperate climate vegetables, though they are mostly inappropriate for our location. We get all of our electricity from solar panels.  Our water is collected from roof catchment systems and stored in tanks. 

For nearly 20 years we organized a traveling circus (HICCUP -Hawaii Island Community Circus) providing weekly performance arts classes throughout Hawaii in schools and in rural communities, plus presenting a range of community performances and circus training camps. Due to the success of these activities we raised funds to build our own community performance arts center. Our SPACE facility opened in November  2007 and has changed the focus of our work. We host a small charter school,  an after school circus program and some adult performance arts classes.

Despite our jungle location, we have a well-equipped and cozy communal kitchen with electricity, telephone, free mainland calls, high speed internet, library, hot showers, refrigerators and flush toilets.</description>

      <name>Quindaro Gardens Mutual Aid Society for Low-cost Living and Retirement in Kansas City</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21820&quot;&gt;Quindaro Gardens Mutual Aid Society for Low-cost Living and Retirement in Kansas City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Reduce cost of living through large-scale group gardening and small &amp; low-cost houses that are extremely energy efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kansas-city-mutual-aid-society/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kansas-city-mutual-aid-society/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Paul Grahovac, corporate attorney, business development executive, risk manager, and building construction product line technical director, in January 2012 purchased an inner-city house in a county tax sale and acquired five vacant lots nearby.  In the period 2012 - 2014, he has created an urban vegetable farm with a mission to give the food grown away in the local community with view to engaging the residents in working the farm and sharing in the bounty.  This has met with some limited success.  Most of the residents who are interested in the project are too elderly to provide any heavy labor.  However, there is lighter work to do, and as the project expands to include the provision of other services, there will be opportunities for people of all ages and abilities to contribute.

This effort continues, and the project has been expanded to attract suburbanites interested in low-cost retirement as well as younger people seeking a lower-cost lifestyle.  The vision is to use the vegetable farm, the low-cost lots available in the neighborhood, and Paul's expertise and contacts in the field of extremely energy efficient houses to help people drive their food costs, housing cost, and utility expense as close to zero as possible.

Toward that end, Paul set up a meetup dot com website called Low-cost retirement alternatives in June, 2014 and immediately had 11 sign-ups representing both retirement- and non-retirement-age demographics.  At the meetup scheduled for July 5, a middle-aged suburban woman and her mother attended and expressed strong interest in moving forward to acquire one or more of the nearby lots from the Unified Government of Kansas City, Kansas and Wyandotte County Landbank for the purpose of constructing a new home. 

Paul does not update this listing, so interested parties should contact him for current information.</description>

We are an Intentional Christian community on Chicago's North side. The Community of The Holy Trinity is a community centered around the life of prayer seeking to offer support and hospitality to artists, social activists and social workers, and to offer group and individual spiritual direction as we walk along side brother's and sisters in Christ on the journey of faith.
The community has been in existence since 2003.  On September 6 2014 3 members two of our founding members established the Order of Jesus Christ, Reconciler (OJCR) and professed permanent vows as founding members of OJCR with two others residing in Detroit.  The order has a charism of Reconciliation. At that time the Community of the Holy Trinity became the first and founding House of the Order of Jesus Christ Reconciler.  
OJCR is in the process of founding a House of the Order in Detroit.  The Community of the Holy Trinity as a House of the order

      <name>Winona Catholic Worker</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21824&quot;&gt;Winona Catholic Worker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Winona Catholic Worker is a diverse faith community that serves people experiencing homelessness in the tradition of Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day. 
Our community runs by consensus, which means each core community member must agree with every major decision our community makes. We have no hierarchy within our core community. We are all in charge together. Anarchists call this style of decision making &quot;consensus democracy.&quot; 
Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin rooted their work in the Roman Catholic tradition; however, many houses of hospitality are run by non-Catholics. While our community has included many Roman Catholics, being Catholic is not a prerequisite to being part of our community.  Currently the majority of our core community are not Roman Catholic.
There is a long history of nonviolent civil disobedience in the Catholic Worker Movement. Dorothy Day was arrested for protesting militarism. Our community has a history of organizing anti-war and pro-environment direct actions. That said, protesting is secondary to our work of hospitality and not a requirement for live-in volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/winona-catholic-worker/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/winona-catholic-worker/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are two houses of hospitality in the Catholic Worker tradition offering drop-in hospitality and evening meal for anyone in need, Monday through Friday at the Bethany House (832 W Broadway). We also offer overnight hospitality for single women at the Dan Corcoran House (802 W Broadway). We publish a newsletter, hold monthly roundtable discussions on topics of current interest, and occasionally organize community events of protest. All are welcome to join us for weekly Eucharistic liturgy on Mondays at 5:00pm, followed by community supper.

Volunteers needed:
We are seeking live-in community members to share in intentional community and the works of mercy. If you are a light-hearted, compassionate, and fun person you might enjoy sharing your life with the poor in our small, family style houses of hospitality. Live-in volunteers are not paid for their work but do receive free room and board as well as use of a community vehicle.  Winona is a small city in southeastern Minnesota, located between the Mississippi River and its bluffs. The scenic beauty of the area helps to strengthen our awareness of rural life and farming issues, while maintaining a global justice perspective. If you are interested, please contact us by phone at 507.454.8094, or email at winonacatholicworker@gmail.com, or by our PO Box 102, Winona, MN 55987.

      <name>Order of the Shepherd's Heart</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21825&quot;&gt;Order of the Shepherd's Heart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To be a model of ecological living within a Celtic Christian monastic ethos, committed to nonviolence, egalitarianism, and diversity; practicing radical hospitality, spiritual mysticism, and sustainable living, through a generous orthodoxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/order-of-the-shepherds-heart/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/order-of-the-shepherds-heart/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Order of the Shepherd’s Heart is an ecumenical covenant community which, while being birthed by the Celtic Christian tradition, is a part of the Free Catholic Movement within Christ Catholic Church Archdiocese of the Prince of Peace.  We are Celtic in spirit, ecumenical in scope, and celebrate a deeply mystical and sacramental approach to the Christian faith.  Shepherd's Heart is composed of men and women in single, celibate, committed, and or open lifestyles who have been called as a domestic and monastic spiritual family into deep love relationships with and in Jesus Christ. Jesus is our example; the Scriptures are our rule; Love is our law.

The Order does not exist to govern every detail of the members’ lives, but to provide support and love, direction and shared experience, encouragement and constructive criticism in our never-ending quest to become “the glory of God: the human person fully alive.”

True to our motto: “Rege Quod est Devium – Bring Back the Wandering” we strive to offer safe pasture and sanctuary within our Order for all wandering Christians who would seek a more intimate union with God and one another. To these ends we offer our Order to any and all who would want to struggle with us to live such a life of “intentional intimacy,” being radically inclusive and turning no one away.

While recognizing the goodness of all creation and humankind, the life of the community is intentionally counter-culture. We are an alternative society living within and alongside the modern secular society, without being a part of it. We are also an expression of renewal and reform within the Church.

Being inclusive, we practice radical hospitality and do not discriminate and hold no regard for a person’s race, color, age, gender, sexual orientation, preference, relationship status, nationality, socioeconomic class, nor a person’s state of grace. We are fully committed to inclusivity and our support for the LGBTQIAPP (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, intersexual, asexual, pansexual, polyamorous) and anyone who would seek to find a spiritual home within the Shepherd’s Heart is unwavering and unapologetic.

We strive to be a model of ecological living as well as an example of what it means to be a Celtic Christian, following the Prince of Peace in the 21st century. We are committed to nonviolence, egalitarianism, diversity, radical hospitality, spiritual mysticism, sustainable living, and a generous orthodoxy.

      <name>Motheroak permaculture coop</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21827&quot;&gt;Motheroak permaculture coop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Integral permaculture practice/ demonstration site. To grow as much of our own food as possible as well as surplus cash crops for farmer's market. To conduct extended permaculture courses via internships as well as workshops. To remain small scale, always putting quality before quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/motheroak-permaculture-coop/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/motheroak-permaculture-coop/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are a permaculture teaching centre/ organic market garden farm. The objective is a community with 4-8 people--and that remains flexible. The vision is to live lightly on the earth, with compassion for oneself and others, and to cultivate a sense of sanity and humor.

 By sanity we mean basic common sense without ego as reference point, understanding how things/ the world works, and always seeking a deep understanding of people and things. 

We are located in rural Nova Scotia, on a beautiful hilltop that has been lately transformed by permaculture design. Our 25 acres is contiguous with another 80 that surrounds us on three sides, and is closely connected through family. Our market garden is about 2-3 acres, and we sell direct at a farmers market. We keep livestock: milk goats, poultry, a workhorse, and sometimes beef animals.

We are spiritual though not religious, as is commonly said these days. Though a buddhist myself, i would say that &quot;integral life practice&quot; more essentially describes what we aspire to. Mindfulness in daily living, a sense of compassion and joy, and not taking oneself (or others) too seriously.

We are definitely keen on peak oil, climate change, and economic meltdown. Our permaculture design has more or less put us on the &quot;lifeboat&quot; option of responses, though we by no means are isolationist.

We are inviting a few good people to join us. Integrity, humor, openness, common sense, a few skills, gentleness, and a willingness to try something different. I suppose our commitment to permaculture ethics makes us radical; so that too.
And a willingness to contribute to the work of living on a farm, whether you farm or not--which is optional. 

The cost of joining is negotiable, and we remain open to creative possibilities. What's really important is shared values, a willingness to cooperate and contribute, honesty and openness, and a flexible, somewhat lighthearted attitude--not so attached to outcomes to the point of distraction. 

Some spanish and italian spoken here too.

Please contact us if you are interested, and we can begin a correspondence. Thanks &amp; cheerio.

As of October 2012 we are looking particularly for a youngish couple who would like to live and work here--with the financial aspect being very negotiable. There are many possibilities, but one that we'd kind of like to stick to is a minimum time commitment of say, two years. If this interests you please see the &quot;Consider joining us page on our website. Thanks!

Would you like to live in a vegan/veggie community house in sunny Sarasota, Florida? It is currently a semi-furnished 3/4 bedroom and 2 bath home (I own) on small lot with a nice swimming pool (child-safe) and beautiful, newly-remodeled kitchen. Near bus-lines and shopping; 4 miles from beach. I live there and am a vegan single woman and have 2 kids (who are not living with me until next July). I am a writer and school teacher interested in radical ecopsychology, shamanism and sustainable living--i.e., organic urban community gardening, recycling, community veggie meals (preferably vegan, but we can compromise), non-violent communication, conserving energy, cooperative parenting, drum circles, phases of the moon, etc. All are welcome. Please contact me if interested.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21830&quot;&gt;Lafayette Morehouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Pleasurable Group Living&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/lafayette-morehouse/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/lafayette-morehouse/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;A Life of More

Lafayette Morehouse has been a successful group living experiment for 48 years. The cornerstone of our philosophy and lifestyle is the concept of perfection. The working premise is that people and situations are right the way they are and include the potential for change. We think that life is to be enjoyed and that can best be done by people doing what they want to do in a way that pleasures the people around them. We think “fun is the goal and love is the way.” We call this Responsible Hedonism.

Since 1968, the community has studied pleasurable group living and all that entails, such as communication, relationships and sensuality. We explore how to have pleasurable relationships that endure because they are so gratifying. We consider ourselves social researchers and present the findings of our lifestyles research to the public in the form of courses in the areas mentioned above and more. Since a group may be as few as two people, our information can be quite useful to anyone  - whether they are single, in a coupled relationship, a family, or any other sized group. We start from the point of view that what you have is good and nothing has to be fixed. We then, offer an array of additional viewpoints and tools to add to those you’ve already assembled to achieve your goals. All our information is descriptive rather than prescriptive.

Vic Baranco conceived the Morehouse lifestyle as one in which people could live together pleasurably without doing anything they didn’t want to do while serving the world unselfishly and profiting by it. Since Vic’s death in 2002, his widow and constant companion of 27 years, Cindy Baranco, has led the group, continuing and forwarding our social research while adding a feminine voice.</description>

We value sharing and seek health, both for ourselves and our planet. Our Values include:
* Sharing
* Environmental Awareness
* Intergenerational
* Neighborhood Partnership
* Healthy Individuals
* Healthy Community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/capitol-hill-urban-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/capitol-hill-urban-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a very diverse community in an incredibly dense neighborhood in Seattle – Capitol Hill.  We have all of our 9 households with children between ages newborn and 13 years old and our adults range from early 30’s to mid-60’s.  

We have 9 units on 4500sf lot (smaller than the typical Seattle single family lot). Our property is located 3 blocks from light rail and has great bus access.  We built with high Built-Green and LEED guidelines achieving as many high-performance sustainability metrics for energy and water usage as much as was financially feasible both now and planning for future upgrades. 

We broke ground in late October, 2014 and took occupancy in March, 2016. Please note we are a unique hybrid model. All members pay $30,000 to join our LLC. The members built the apartment building and we are self-managed. We will pay market rate rents which will be kept artificially as stable as possible, rather than increasing with the market. This is intended to entice longevity. We are currently developing a vesting system.</description>

We have been here for over 30 years. Our purpose is to create and maintain a place for us to live in harmony with each other and the land, most of which is to be left wild.
.
We are located in Mendocino County, CA, a few miles west of Hwy 101, two hours north of San Francisco and about 25 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean. Our elevation ranges mostly between 1000 to 1700 feet and we are in zone 8B - 9A. There are panoramic views of the Ukiah Valley to the east, and more hills to the west. The vegetation includes native and introduced grasses, oak &amp; madrone trees and forest, and some patches of fir forest and chaparral. Many animal species share this land. There are a number of seasonal creeks/streams and we have developed several ponds and year around springs.
.
We are off-grid and committed to minimizing our fossil fuel consumption, using renewable energy - mostly sun, but also wind, methane, and hydro. Several of us are engaged in permaculture design.
.
Heartland, Inc. is a California S-corporation with ten shares . . . one share per leasehold. Each of the ten shares/leaseholds is represented on the Board of Directors (BOD), which meets at least twice per year. Other community meetings and committee meetings occur more frequently. The majority of the work necessary to develop and maintain both the land and the corporation is done by us. We have paid off the land in full, developed the roads, phone and water systems, and built the homes on the land. We prefer to make decisions by consensus, resorting to democratic voting when the former is unachievable.
.
Each leasehold is comprised of 10 acres for development by the shareholder/lessee and their household within the guidelines we have collectively established. Some of us have lived here for over 30 years and some do not yet live on the land. These leaseholds are scattered across the 800 acres, leaving 700 acres of land which is not for development though can be used for hiking and horseback riding.
.
We currently have a share/lease-site available to an individual, family, or group. There are also openings for individuals in some of the established leaseholds. Contact us for more information.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21833&quot;&gt;Project TriStar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; MISSION: To create off-the-grid, eco-friendly, sustainable, and conscious communities that provide a safe and harmonious lifestyle for those who choose to live their lives based on natural and universal laws. To create a community model that is both revolutionary and evolutionary in the world of long-term sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/project-tristar/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/project-tristar/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Project TriStar is an off-the-grid, eco-friendly, sustainable, and spiritual community that provides a safe and harmonious lifestyle for those who choose to live their lives based on natural and universal laws.

The intent of the Project TriStar initiative is to create a lifestyle and an environment that supports the community goals of self sufficiency, healthy living, mutual respect, individual responsibility, and personal growth.

There are those who may say that Project TriStar is an attempt at creating a utopian, idealistic, and totally unachievable community model. The truth is that the ability to manifest or achieve any goal in life is based on experiential knowledge (education), understanding (perception), and beliefs.

Imagine the world we live in today. On one extreme, we have communities that are violent, destructive, and at constant war with one another. On the other extreme, we have communities that are supportive, harmonious, and at constant peace with one another. Every other social structure, community, town, city, state, country is somewhere in between these two extremes. In other words, to say the Project TriStar initiative is unattainable is simply a perception of what we believe is or is not possible based on our experiential knowledge.

Project TriStar is not an Ashram or monastery, but it is unique from what most people would perceive as “community” based on present day socioeconomic standards. The Project TriStar initiative is to bridge the gap between the physical world and the spiritual world in a way that harmonizes with the growing internal desire and seeking for a better way of living on planet Earth. In essence, Project TriStar provides a realistic and attainable alternative to living in the social and economic structures that are commonly practiced throughout the world today.

The Project TriStar community embraces spiritual principles that include: decisions that are prioritized with their impact on nature, natural resources, and universal laws. Every member of the community acknowledges the goals of living from their heart, in harmony with these principles and each other, and with a passion towards service to others.

Our goals: to be priced at market level or less, sustainable, and diverse.

Our models for living together include cohousing--homes for individual households, plenty of shared space &amp; meals, decisions by consensus--and the ecovillage concepts of living in a socially, economically and ecologically sustainable manner.

We're interested in possibly sharing:
• work space (for those of us working from home)
• dinners
• a garden to grow some of our own food
• child care
• space for yoga, other kinds of movement
• home schooling
• cars
• a food buying club
• community-supported agriculture (CSA membership) 

Our vision of retrofitting includes affordable energy efficiency and sustainability. E.g., solar-assisted hot water, rainwater reclamation, foam insulation under the roof.</description>

The common unity of Tipi Village is focused on living in low-impact move-able dwellings,recognizing ourselves as an integral part of our environment and our effect upon it.
  We move twice a year living in the mountains during the summer and the valley below in the winter. We use the talking circle for collective communication and decision-making. The Big Lodge (community space) is used for shared meals, circles, events, ceremonies and as a guest space. Our free-ranging children move through the woods on winding paths. Much of their learning and understanding comes from all that this way of living offers and by the collective and individual knowledge that is passed on.
  Being with the elements is a living practice. Living on the ground, in a circle, centered around the open fire, listening to the sound of the soft snow against the canvas, or the wind making its way through the trees to our lodge and adjusting the smoke flaps accordingly, fetching water that is given from the springs and the creeks and gathering firewood on foot with a bow saw from the surrounding trees.
  It is a rich and luxurious life. A gourmet meal cooked over an open fire and sharing food with loved ones around a living center, the hearth, bathing in spring water that is warmed by the sun or fire, gathering the surrounding plants to make a salad, wine or medicine, the personal growth that comes from the willingness to live and work together in community, the creative potential that can manifest from the coming together of people and the fewer distractions that the industrialized world demands.
  Tipi Village in Southern Oregon is only just beginning. Great potential exists here, the potential that lies in simplicity. It is what we bring to the community that forms it. The mission is to continue to cultivate a culture of a multi-generational, diverse, migratory, off-the-road collective, to create something that thrives for generations to come.
  If any of this resonates with you, the reader, please follow your inspiration. Come find us, share some tea and stay in the Big Lodge.

As of Imbolc 2016 there is no Big Lodge so best get in touch and find out where we're at.

We are looking for open-minded people (who enjoy a bit of a hippie/reggae vibe) to help form an off-grid, self sustainable village. 
We are family people with children and dogs, but we seek to provide a nurturing growth experience where a relationship with the earth and a love for cultural diversity and real world learning experiences are the main intentions.
Like most others here, we are striving for self-sustainability - hopes to maintain our own structures, grow our own food, use of alternate energy, etc.

This is still just in the dream phase as we do not yet own land...perhaps pooling resources would be the quickest way to get this going. Certainly open to suggestions!

Long to live in a community supporting a path of love, simple life and growth? 
I am looking for 2-3 people serious about spiritual growth and holistic living to form a healthy tribe around core values which include: 

-- No longer being alone in our efforts to evolve mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually
-- Sharing one or more regularly-scheduled meals per week
-- Having weekly house meetings to check in with members and discuss issues
-- Making decisions by consensus
-- Practicing non-violent communication
-- Living organically and loving the earth, leaving as small a footprint as possible
-- Maintaining a clean-air environment, free of household chemicals and fragrances
-- Valuing kindness as our religion and compassion as our doctrine
-- Revering all life as holy
-- Respecting diversity as a tool for healing and growth
-- Regarding health as sacred, in all mental, social and physical forms
-- Eating all or mostly raw foods, vegetarian foods, and organic foods. (No foods are specifically banned, but the idea is to form a community of people who honor their bodies and choose healthy options in whatever way that means to them.) 
-- Trusting that service is an expression of the divine and that freely giving does not diminish a person
-- Taking responsibility for your actions and how they impact others
-- Sharing all household tasks and meal prep on a rotating basis

Obviously, this will be a non-smoking household. 
People of all ages, gender, race, sexual orientation, and abilities welcome.
Pets will be negotiable with landlord and community, when formed. 
Goal is to keep costs at a maximum of $550 a month per person, to garden, and live as sustainably as possible.

Welcome to the domain of Mother Earth “Douceur et Harmonie”: a vegan, intentional and eco community.

We are looking for long-term and permanent residents and investors.

We are vegan community (Vivien, Bluette, Sylvain, volunteers, guests and visitors) living on 21 hectares of protected green forest and organic gardens. Situated in the eastern Pyrenees in the south of France. The house and gardens are on a ridge where you can see both the sun rise in the east and set in the west, the Mediterranean in the distance and have a great view of the sacred Canigou mountain of Catalonia. This area is famous for incredible fresh stream water, river swimming, natural hot baths, abundant local and Spanish produce, camping, hiking and great lighting. Generally everyone speaks french but Bluette is fluent in English. There is a plenty of wild edible herbs, vegetable and herb gardens, fruit trees and berry bushes. Food is usually organic fruits, veggies, herbs, nuts, fresh (non wheat) bread, brown rice, spices, oils, and fresh carrot juice. The water comes from a spring on the property and is delicious. A peaceful, calm, tranquil, inspiring and quiet environment where the focus has been “gentleness and harmony” since 1964 when Vivien first arrived. There is always something to do in the gardens and orchards or around the large house (9+ rooms). The Douceur et Harmonie property is owned by an association and is strictly vegan (no smoking, no alcohol, no meat or animal products) and keen on the ethical and loving treatment of animals. Hence, D et H has been the home of many vegetarian animals such a birds, geese, ducks, rabbits, roosters and chickens; however, carnivorous animals such as dogs and cats are not welcome due to their tendency to attack the above animals (this has happened in the past). If you have a very gentle vegan/vegetarian dog, that is a different story. Solar heated water, solar ovens, and spring water swimming pool. Water source is the spring on the land. The traditional stone(huge)farm house is over 250 years old. We are interested in hosting Permaculture Design Courses and integrating more permaculture principles and techniques - including natural building design. A great place for writers, mucisians, aritists, or the average person who desires to get their creatvie juices flowing.

UPDATE: As of April 2016 we do not have any units available. All of our units are currently occupied by our member owners. However, we welcome future prospective inquirers to contact us. Additionally, we occasionally have short-term sublet opportunities. Please inquire for current openings.

The Logan Square Cooperative was purchased on 10/31/01 and includes 1 three-bedroom unit, 1 two-bedroom unit, 5 one-bedroom units, and 1 three-room studio.

We feel part of a real community with dynamic and diverse people (11 adults and 3 children) all dedicated to peace and justice and part of larger community as members of Logan Square Neighborhood Association. Child-friendly and pet-friendly. Lush garden, laundry facilities, and basement storage. Solar system for hot water installed and new back porches. Close to public transport (near Diversey and Pulaski); park and free swimming pool just a block away; garage space is rotated for $50 a month.

Our Coop is a limited equity coop because we are committed to long-term affordable housing. We have saved a large building from for-profit developers, and we are encouraging others to try the same. If a member moves out, (s)he only would take the amount put toward principal on the mortgage, downpayment, and major improvements (s)he put in that have been approved by the coop- that defines limited equity.

We are governed by By-Laws, the Principles of Unity, and Occupancy Agreements. Our criteria for membership include: Agreement with the principles of unity; commitment to affordable housing and living; commitment to keep Chicago a city in which affordable housing is available to everyone; a lifestyle and belief system which reflects commitment to social equality;  financial stability to ensure financial commitment to the cooperative; willingness to make a commitment to living cooperatively by dedicating time and skills to cooperative work and activities; effectively communicating with members; ability to be flexible and tolerant and open to ideas and lifestyles of others; commitment to stay long term in LSC; has skills that would add to LSC existing skills, abilities and interests; Sense of humor and willingness to share joy; agreement on process of consensus decision making and willingness to learn and practice this process (Consensus is different from majority vote. We strive to ensure that each coop decision has the full backing of all of our members through adequate fact-finding, democratic discussion, and addressing the root cause of any objections).

Given the present economic crisis, this is your way to save money, live in better conditions, take a stand for affordable housing, and build community. As a member you would own a share in the Coop; the Coop owns the building.

      <name>Cinderland Eco Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21843&quot;&gt;Cinderland Eco Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our vision is a world where everyone lives in ecological harmony. We believe in sustainable, responsible agriculture, like making sure to replenish the soil, saying no to crossbred GMOs, and living in harmony with our animal brethren as well.


Jezus’s mission is to build an eco friendly, self sustaining community starting from barren land and minimal funding. Starting with land, a dream, and many compassionate helping hands, we’ve learned as we progressed and are proud to be an example of how anyone can build a eco-friendly village or homestead like ours.

The main goal is to be completely off the grid, growing all our own food, with complete independence from the modern worlds support. We want to start from nothing and reach complete sustainability with only 20 years of perseverance to do it; and by golly we’re almost there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/cinderland-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/cinderland-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Cinderland is an ecovillage located in a beautiful, jungle-like landscape on the Big Island of Hawai'i. About 20 miles southeast of Hilo, and about 2 miles from the easternmost tip of the island, just a mile and a half from the coastline it lies. We are a community building a life founded on self-sustainability, organic gardening and permaculture. We share the dream of a simple, healthy, natural way of life.

We are minutes away from the black sands beach, tide pools, volcano steam vents, warm ponds, Green Lake, &quot;ecstatic dance&quot;, health food store and many farmer's markets, and neighbors ready to trade produce just around the corner on Papaya Farms Road. 

Residents and neighbors gather in our kitchen for shared meals on our infamous Taco Tuesday potluck, and various other shindigs and drum jams. Our community kitchen also features an in ground fire pit, piano, and bunk beds. 

All of our residents are at home in an all-you-can-eat buffet, you can eat whatever you like that grows on the land, we will teach you how to harvest sustainably and trade with the neighbors to keep the cycle going too. The gardens, greenhouse, solar oven, and solar dehydrator are also free for use to anyone who wants to learn. 

We welcome people of all backgrounds and nationalities, particularly those that are open, love the earth and are committed to its preservation. 



Come see what we're about, we would love to have you here,

      <name>1st Amazon Ecovillage | Guayana Peace Trail Project</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21845&quot;&gt;1st Amazon Ecovillage | Guayana Peace Trail Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Establish an indigenous modern way of life that is in accordance with nature using appropriate technology and all that we exemplify as humans in our natural state on earth as good people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/1st-intl-model-life-change-ecovillage-and-pioneer-settlement-project/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/1st-intl-model-life-change-ecovillage-and-pioneer-settlement-project/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We learned see the world differently by living in the Amazon's Highlands, now you can too! Want to become an ecologically sustainable person? Can you live in harmony with our natural world? Can you live like an indigenous Amerindian? Perhaps a bit better if you apply some technology, practical application and utilize your theoretical ideals.

We began our journey down the road to life (our new way) in 2007 to establish a better way (a new natural ecoculture), because we discovered that the life course we had been taking was not the right path to lead us where we need to be in order to establish a harmonious existence as co-inhabitants of the planet.

Everyone should want to consider themselves good, peaceful, compassionate and knowledgeable human beings. We realized our purpose as co-inhabitants of the planet is a socially responsible one. We are finally as of August 2013 we began to realize that dream with two base properties here in South America.

The two properties are approximately 700 kilometers (435 miles) apart that's if you were a bird. If you walk (hike or backpack) the two locations are nearly 1000 km apart (600 miles) the hike can take from 50 days to 3 months, if you take time to appreciate the beauty it could also take 6 months or even a year if you make friends along the way or decide to take time to study, do conservation work, contemplate your world, or just stop along the way to live for a while. 

Our initial project was developed to become independent of property ownership however we discovered that people (government, authorities, indigenous neighbors) would not permit our peaceful coexistence as nomads or settlers in their territories without being one of them or allied with in their consciousness and world view. So now we have two base locations and the entire Guiana Shield and Amazon as our backyard.

Imagine an indigenous native American (Amerindian) village hybridized with a modern campground facility built using selected appropriate technologies incorporating alternative energy sources to produce abundant organic foods, enjoy modern showers, a clear cold water swimming pond, individual and group cabins, that all comes together at a grand central complex where residents and visitors can gather in a central garden lodge, eat meals in a communal kitchen and involve themselves in community group projects while taking advantage of a modern research station and ecological study center with WiFi Internet access beside a public school facility for residents which doubles as a movie theater, workshop and meeting forum for residents and visitors in the evenings.

Our dream project is just beginning and is constantly changing, its likely we will be in construction stages. They started on March 03, 2014 at Ekobius and will be working on the development in practice now before the cooperative charter on December 31, 2016. People with ideas that can support and tolerate (enjoy) this lifestyle should come and share them and implement them here with us!</description>

I believe 4 to 10 people contributing $50000 to $100000 each would provide enough capital to enable construction of a new residence to accomodate all. I would be able to contribute $100000 or more if the right property and people were available. Perhaps those with less but exceptional skills could become members too but initially I would not want to have any debt so cash contributions from founding members would be essential to get started.
Over the past 5 years many wonderful people have responded to my initial posting. I have had many enlightening conversations with people that share a fairly similar vision. Please continue to share with me your great ideas and visions as it all adds to the discussion, thank you.) What follows is my original post with edits done as of March 2015.
Im 59, straight, my children are all grown and I am now single, still in good health and want to retire near the ocean on Van Island within an hour of medical facilities. Victoria to Campbell River, maybe even Cowichan Valley or Sooke.
 I wonder if there are other like minded people that would like to pool finances and labor to build a small, eco aware community of young at heart (and younger ones if they wished) I dont know the details but I am a former builder and carpenter and I still have a few (fewer now as I did build one more in 2011/2012 and it was not any easier lol) houses left in me before the physical work of building is no longer enjoyable. I envision perhaps a 2 to 10 acre parcel, maybe an existing home, but the plan would be to build a larger home, or second home for all members, a large garden for fresh veggies,(land must be arable)maybe some chickens, cows, goats, pigs, rabbits,a couple of shared vehichles, maybe a shared boat for fishing?.  Living a simpler slower life. I Still want plumbing, potable water, electricity and internet service etc are essential. (Plumbers, electricians, carpenters all welcome). Although I know little about solar and alternative energy they are also interesting.  I have no religious affiliations other than Im Christian and share ideals like no tobaco, occasional alchohol, follow the golden rule, treat others as you would like to be treated and be fair about everything you do. I also believe that humor and laughter are essential to healthy day to day living. There is much more to discuss and write and nothing is cast in stone, but I just thought Id see if there are others that might have a similar vision for their retirement years. No drugs, no criminal types, I have no criminal record, I'm not a crusader trying to change the world. All I want is to know that I have a home where I can share my retirement with others in a mutually beneficial way. Living a comfortable but simple lifestyle by the ocean. People with morals, and a good sense of humor. Intelligent, enthusiastic, life long learners. If that sounds like you then please share your vision. 
Another update is that I have taken an interest in the benefits of Yoga and although I know very little about it I would like to learn and I can see it as being a part of my future. Another update is that after a long absence from music I have taken up finger style picking again on the guitar and music has become a daily activity again. So musicians and Yoges are most welcome. I still love my pasta with meat sauce but am also graduating to a more green diet. I am a very open minded sort and would still like to hear from folks, young or old that think along the same lines. 
I just read about Bryn Gweled through the link. It sounds very similar to what I envision. It is a very interesting website. I hope to hear from you.

We are:

-An organic &amp; permaculture farm growing &amp; selling organic produce, herbs &amp; berries. We raise/produce most of our own foods &amp; needs, including meat, dairy, eggs, soaps &amp; more. We have a CSA this year and are doing some markets

-A 19th century village, complete with weaving mill, one-room school, blacksmith shop, tin shop, letterpress print shop, bakery, rope/broom shop, wagon &amp; wheel shop, Gen’l Store and much more. We welcome folks to take over and run a shop, become proficient, teach others and generate self income.

-A school; We teach classes on many heritage skills; survival/homesteading, soap, candle, cheese &amp; butter making, wild plant use &amp; more. We host a Homeschool co-op on Tuesdays.

We have a ‘primative liv’n’ 24×12 w/ loft cabin open for this spring. It has outhouse, outside wash house, wood cookstove &amp; nearby additional cook house &amp; pavillion. Cabin has limited electricity. We have a foundation for a yurt, and have a very large teepee. Other cabins or living space can be built as needed.

We welcome gardening help right now. We are also looking for people who want to learn by doing and people with knowledge or willingness to work in any shop of your choosing and possibly teach the skill of their choice.

We especially appreciate help with all the everyday farm chores including gardening, hauling manure/woodchips/grass clippings, animal care &amp; other informative &amp; fun stuff. 

We’d like someone who enjoys children, as many are often here and we have 3 of our own, and someone willing to help with childcare. 

We offer a full work for living trade. No money exchanged. We don’t allow or condone drugs of any kind. We make quite tasty wines, but very rarely consume it. ...and never to excess. We have no interest in drama or negative thinking.


You’re welcome to garden &amp; pasture space to raise your own food. We are not looking for city people who want an adventure. We are looking for people that want to be prepared, want to live sustainably, like to work hard and enjoy life in the country. 

We’re spiritual, but non ‘religious’. We honor the Nature Spirits and Fairies. We try to live in ways compatible with how Great Mystery would have us live. We are believers in &amp; practitioners of manifestation. We honor the season changes &amp; have Ceremony as we are moved.  We also enjoy Christian church.

We have been taught Original People’s Ancient Traditional Wisdom &amp; Prophesy (mostly by Seneca &amp; Lakota Elders) &amp; will share such (as it was shared w/. us) as we grow to know one another.

We've had as many as 14 people living here during the summer. Currently our family of 5 (7 yr old, 4 yr old, 2 yr old) and a lovely family of 3 are here. Others visit daily, and it is rare to eat a meal alone.

We aim to provide a welcoming place for our crones who want an alternative to typical retirement communities. to form a collective where the mothers operate the community and the children and &quot;grandmothers&quot; enjoy each other, with home school classes provided. We aim to give the mothers gainful employment so that they may get on their feet and begin pursuing their life's work. We'd also like to provide a concert venue that features female musicians and a community space, both of which would extend to the general public. We eventually hope to offer DIY classes to the general public.

The mothers would assist our elders, provide meals and other domestic services, plant and tend to vegetables and herbs, manage livestock (probably just chickens to start).

We are currently looking for bed and breakfast type places in or close to Floyd, Virginia. Trust me, you'll want to stay here. We'll need a place with an existing large house/B&amp;B, with room on the property to expand. We are also looking for financial contributors. Your financial donation will help sponsor the mothers and their children so that they may thrive and contribute to society with their very best gifts. 

Some of you have a lot of money, more than you need. perhaps you'd like to retire in a place like this and use your money to make a difference in a mother's life. We need to use our gifts to help those who really need it.</description>

The Community is a 50-unit apartment complex on 5 acres and is part of the network of Ananda Communities worldwide. Residency is open to all who are sincere and open to the practice of meditation and yoga in the tradition and teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda (author of “Autobiography of a Yogi”). There are approximately 75 adults and 20 children in residence. There are both community and individual gardens. Residents can grow vegetables, fruit, and flowers; the grounds include ornamental landscaping, large trees, a swimming pool, a nature trail, and a lawn for gatherings and play. A separate community center provides space for meditation and yoga, classes and gatherings, banquets, and more. A community kitchen is run by residents and provides regular vegetarian dinners each week, open to friends and visitors as well as residents. Nearby, the Ananda Portland Temple and Teaching Center in Beaverton offers classes in meditation, yoga and spiritual development. The first Ananda Community was established in 1968 by Swami Kriyananda, direct disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda, near Nevada City, California, USA.
Residents rent their own apartments. Rents are set by local market rates for comparable apartments. On-site co-managers handle day-to-day needs, with the help of periodic community work days and volunteer participation. The complex is owned by a supportive group of investors and leased to the local Ananda organization for the operation of an intentional spiritual community.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21850&quot;&gt;PachaMama Eco Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Located on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, the spiritual eco-village of PachaMama is a temple of healing and expansion of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/pachamama-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/pachamama-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
PachaMama was established in 1999 by spiritual teacher and visionary Tyohar. The internal work in PachaMama focuses on meditation and points to the silence within. This community is home to about 70 residents who gathered from all over the world to walk the same path of inner growth and chose an alternative lifestyle.
Year round therapy, yoga, cleanse and other groups take place in PachaMama. These are led by house therapists as well as guest therapists. The foundation of PachaMama is the silent retreats taking place three times a year, at the end of the a 5 weeks long &quot;Transformation Cycle&quot;.
Visitors enjoy a variety of accommodation, from simple casitas to bungalows and houses. Some visitors choose to camp in tents and enjoy even greater proximity to the wild nature and the forest in which PachaMama dwells.
The children of PachaMama attend the village's school and kindergarten, under the care of a team made of professional teachers and volunteer teachers.
In the past 15 years thousands of visitors passed through the gates of PachaMama and through life changing experiences. We have touched their hearts with silence, love, music and celebration.

LEAPNOW is a community devoted to wholeness-based education and conscious living for all ages. Our 10-acre residential community with 10 residents (called Maacama) is 90 miles north of San Francisco in Sonoma County's wine country.  LEAPNOW runs soul-centered education programs for ages 17 and up that combine international immersion, college credit, conscious community and language study.  Our LEAPYEAR program is a full academic year long and is devoted to inner exploration and world travel. LEAPYEAR2 builds on the first year program and teaches the facilitation of transformative education.   Body Visible/Body Invisible (BVBI) is a year-long training in authentic movement.   During retreats on our land, students learn conscious living skills and create conscious community, engage in rites of passage, and learn to cook, bake, build, and create. LEAPNOW is devoted to empowering students of all ages to &quot;be the change&quot; they wish to see in the world.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21852&quot;&gt;Kasteel Nieuwenhoven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Like trees in a forest - each stands on its own but together they form a greater whole&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kasteel-nieuwenhoven/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kasteel-nieuwenhoven/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Kasteel Nieuwenhoven is a new and evolving project located on an a 20 Hectare estate consisting of historic buildings (Castle and Farm) surrounded by woodlands, farmland and lakes. In this magical setting a small group of people are experimenting with and discovering ways of living together in harmony with nature and themselves. In its initial years many activities and sevices were shared but this led to a surprisingly uneven distribution of labour and costs. We now gave a more fair system were each inhabitant/family are/ is responsible for themselves. Some are more involved in community activities and economy , others own or rent units and share costs. The project is evolving into a more diverse, organic village type community.  The Castle serves as a venue for groups and courses and offers guest facilities. It is home to a Permaculture School and a new Communnity Supported Agriculture scheme, relying on the extensive permaculture gardens. The beautiful surroundings make this a specially good place for residential programs and long-staying guests. 
Many of the buildings on the property are in poor condition or in need of retro-fitting to convert into living quarters; carrying this out and financing the extensive work is one of the communities big challenges.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21853&quot;&gt;Haley House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Since the start, the Live-In Community of Haley House has brought together diverse, loving, and dedicated people who have offered to commit themselves fully to the daily mission of Haley House, while living together as an intentional community on the top floors of 23 Dartmouth Street. While managing the direct services of Haley House, volunteers commit to living together as a community, building deep connections with each other and our guests. Hospitality is key to the community’s way of life. We share friendship, space, and material goods that we have received through the generosity of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/haley-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/haley-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Joining the community is much more than a full time job. Living intentionally means not only serving the poor but being responsible to each other through weekly meetings, community meals, shared tasks, and a mindful approach to daily life. In our collective decision-making we utilize the consensus process and emphasize careful listening and mutual respect –- values that we try to live out both in our personal lives and our work in the soup kitchen.

Living together takes courage. It means challenging each other with a deep respect for the learning process of each individual, while holding a safe space for positive growth. Community living also requires accountability to both those we serve and those who support us.

More than simply contributing to the day-to-day running of Haley House, the Live-In program stands as a witness to the value of community in a society of increasingly isolated individuals. By living simply and communally, and engaging intentionally with each other and our guests, we try to provide an example of what can be accomplished through sharing resources and valuing relationships.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21854&quot;&gt;La Cité Écologique de Ham-Nord&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Cité Écologique is an ecovillage located in Ham-Nord in the region of Quebec where residents give priority to education, sustainable development and respect.

We offer an alternative lifestyle where businesses, community and sustainability are intertwined. 

Visitors and interns are welcome to join our visitor's program during summer time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/la-cite-ecologique-de-ham-nord/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/la-cite-ecologique-de-ham-nord/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Cité Écologique started in Ham-Nord, Quebec, Canada in 1984. Now, one hundred members live there on a permanent basis. The community started as an alternative school based on “respect for nature.”   In the beginning our goal was to create a new educational model in the countryside where parents, teachers, grandparents, children, and all members of our community could participate in providing an ideal learning environment for children. We wanted a place-based school close to nature. 
Since the beginning, our goal was also to create ecological businesses where parents could work and children could learn through integrated activities and apprenticeship programs. We have worked hard to accomplish and expand upon our initial intentions.
Many of our students have become managers of the businesses we run, and have expanded these businesses’ territories across Canada and the US. Organic culture, manufacturing of clothing using earth-friendly fabrics, health care, crafts, and import-export are some of the businesses we built on our site.
In addition to running ethical and successful businesses, we take care of our land by practicing organic farming and sustainable forestry. We grow our fruits and vegetables in our fields and 4 greenhouses and we sell the surplus after the community’s needs have been met. Over the years, we have planted thousands of trees all over the property, and we have practice selective logging when needed for construction or heating.
Today, Cité Écologique is led by its second generation which pursues similar purposes and community practices as those adopted by their predecessors, such as: buying as a group, sharing meals each day, car-pooling, recycling, reusing... Ultimately, Cité Écologique is a great place to experience hands-on internship programs.  

Internship program at La Cité:
-Organic Farming:
This internship is for those seeking a comprehensive experience with organic farming (fruits and vegetables in greenhouses and fields). 
-Community Living:
This is an excellent internship for those with a wide range of interests, or for those who want to learn more about community life in general.
Students are welcomed!

We are ready to buy land (or invest in an interview sta lusher intentional community), and have decided to do it in the Portland, OR/Vancouver, WA area. We are currently &quot;camping&quot; until we find our spot. 

The O'Quinn family has sold and given away all of their possessions to move their farming activities from California to the Portland/Vancouver area. 

We have spent the past 10 years helping farms and teaching by example about food, community service, and varying degrees of sustainable lifestyle practices. We are ready now to buy some land and continue our legacy as urban farmers. 

We are now successfully living in our camper truck while establishing employment in preparation for a real estate loan (which could take 6 months or longer!)

We like to move our camp every week as to keep the energy fresh and our hosts happy. 

We are expert at leaving a small footprint and allowing our hosts their privacy. We are also open to socializing with our hosts and sharing more of our story ;-)

Plus! We have skills to share if that suits our hosts (handyman, chef, crafter, healer, dance instructor, house/pet/livestock care-takers, permaculture, master gardener). 

Our rig is fully self contained (but we do appreciate electricity, water, and wifi whenever it is offered). 

Our camp consists of the camper truck and two cars.

Mountain Village World Community
----------------------------
Jul 14, 2010 
Description of Mountain Village Community

WHO ARE WE? 
We are O'Quinn Mountain Village Homestead &amp; World Community Gardens. Our core group consists of, Ann O'Quinn (age 42 - Earth Mamma), Cornelius O'Quinn (age 52 - Celtic Druid Building Contractor Mountain Man), Blu O'Quinn (age 18 - Sparkly Swing Dancin River Guide Chic), Derek Suhar (age 20 - Groovy Grounded Community Dude). See our pics and blogs on website. We are a semi-nomadic sustainable community with permaculture tendancies who like to cross-pollinate. 

WHAT DO WE DO? 
We offer ourselves to land-owners for a contracted period of time to do good work with Mother Earth and within the surrounding community. Our community ranges from 4-10 interns. We have a core group of 4 members, and we cycle other traveling interns in and out of the mix for special projects throughout the year. Sometimes we have chickens, cats, and dogs. We garden, clear/burn brush, care for animals, compost, barter, build, make music, reach out to youth, and participate in community events and farmer's markets (we are known for our raw, organic nut/seed butters, carrot juice, and kombucha teas). While permaculture is mostly known for its application in gardens or land development, its broader definition is the study of living systems. While Mountain Village is quite involved with organic gardening, we are known and appreciated for the space that we create for the organic unfoldment within group dynamics, personal relationships, and the greater community.

(Construction completed in July 2014, with all condo units sold.  Please visit www.durhamcoho.com for more info and to sign up for communications.)

Durham Coho (The Durham Central Park Cohousing Community) is a group of individuals, couples and families who have created an urban, green, intentional cooperative housing community in downtown Durham, North Carolina (USNews &quot;Best Places to Live&quot;).    

We are located within easy walking distance of the Farmers' Market, the library, the YMCA, restaurants, stores, county senior center, parks, performing arts center, and theaters. We're less than 2 miles Duke University and its famous Medical Center.  Our four-story building of 24 urban condominiums designed for aging-in-place was completed in July 2014 with units of 850-1700 sq ft and with access to common dining room, kitchen, great room, meeting rooms, guest bedrooms, gardens, and rooftop patio.

Ours is an eco approach to intentional communal / family living eventually retiring as an active, valued elder.  Stewards of the land, inviting like minded people who share a similar vision...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/dos-tortugas-ecuador/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/dos-tortugas-ecuador/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
At long last, our dream is in progress as we launch into a new/old adventure. Two of us started this venture approx. 7 years ago, one german, one americano. Then a few years later Christina (also German) joined us. Our combined skills include building, architecture design, education, teaching, library, school psychology--dealing w/ mentally handicapped-- plus overall general experience in communities. We have established good friendships and connections with the people in the surrounding pueblos, and gained their respect. 

     We bought the land and put in the infrastructure. Currently, four houses are finished; the primary one also has three rentals. (3rd one is Christina's private home)

Over time, we have had various interested visitors come and go. The primary reason for the rentals is to accommodate potential, serious new members, so we can get to know each other; secondly, to create income.   

     Our project is not intended for profit nor investment. Instead, we are looking for pioneers who have the ability to lay the ground work for long-term living and retiring in this single-family and future co-housing community. As time went by, we've been making plans for a retirement community; site work and building plans are done.  Bottom line is to care for each other and the 'larger family' without ending up in a strange retirement home.  Our plan is to bring in assistance as needed.

    The average temperature here 76 degrees, and we have two seasons: wet and dry. Everybody looks forward to rainy season to start new crops, also more water for our established plantings.  We put in a thousand plants, including coconut palms(which line our entrance road), papayas, citrus, mangoes, bananas, plantains, yucca, hardwood trees, plus establishing  gardens and field crops, semi-organic (still trying to co-exist w/ mother nature, see what she allows us to grow).  Down here, permaculture is a whole new ballgame, esp. when met with hungry creatures ranging from leaf-cutter ants to 4 ft. long iguanas! That's why we built a greenhouse. We can protect our vegetables with netting and not spray...
    Regarding our website-- we lost the old one, now working on the new one, more to come...

We will be purchasing land in Central Eastern Texas. All members must be vegetarian or vegan, and committed to the gradual development of sustainability and simpler lifestyles in practical ways. Intoxication, including alcohol, is not allowed. 

Modern conveniences are acceptable in moderation, and as we gradually gain experience in natural lifestyles less &quot;conveniences&quot; become necessary. 

The residential portion of the community will consist of individually-owned households on 1 or 1.5 acres each, grouped into villages of 8 households, with a village common area in the center. Each household's land is around the village, like the spokes of a wheel. Land should be productively used, for personal use or for barter within the community. Everyone must grow some percentage of their food. 

Stabilized compressed earth block is our first choice in construction method, second is Earthbag. Electricity and water are available via rainwater harvesting and solar panels within each household. A well will be dug in each village, for agricultural use. The community lake is for recreational and aesthetic purposes, but the water can be used in time of emergency. 

Governance will be by consensus at the village level and the community level. The community will have broader rules, and each village may have more specific rules according to the resident's own choosing, within the parameters of the community rules.

Newly forming intentional Christian Community, looking for co-founders with similar visions.

We have 240 acres just south of Abilene, Texas.  Its attributes are:  180 arable, good soil, soon to be organic certified, good subsurface water, more than a mile of woodland trails along Elm Creek, great wind and sun resources, city limits of Abilene just 2 miles away (great for veggie sales or a PYO operation).

The vision:  We would like to live in a community together with like-minded believers in order to:  have the benefits of a real community, share resources, fellowship, and to minister to our community.  

The details:  My vision is of a sustainable community of mostly closely spaced adobe houses (which are perfect for this part of the world -goggle compressed earth blocks) utilizing solar and wind power to the extent possible and practical, and trying to create small scale agriculture and craft industries to make income and to bring neighbors into the community.   Central housing area surrounded by gardens, farms and grazing land.  I'm partial to children, so I'd like to find a way to house a few foster families (rescue the children).

The legal structure:  Probably a non-profit together with a LLC.  

The legal details:  In Texas municipalities have a ETJ (Extra Territorial Jurisdiction) that gives them the right to set development standards 5 miles out from their city limits.  That effects this effort because to sell smaller than 10 acre lots will have prohibitive development requirements.  Therefore, the lots have to be 10 acres or we would have to just have the land owned by an LLC, with 99 year leases to the members.  This would allow improvements to be owned, but the real estate would remain the property of the LLC.  Other advantages of this:  limit equity aquisition (we need to be making homes, not building equity) and we have some control over the buyers of property (they must be approved as members of the community first).  Maybe the sale of a few 10 acre lots to founders in order to capitalize the community.

My Influences (so you'll know better who I am):  Jesus, the Bible, Wendell Berry, Our Suburban Nation, Joel Salatin,  George MacDonald

The goal of Oak Forest is to create a collaborative that focus's on personal creativity,growing organic food,and developing marketable products to sell at area farmers markets and craft-shows.The intention is to create affordable housing that will foster personal enjoyment of area,a exchange of creative ideas,and hopefully a sense of community.Well,I should say the house incorporates many energy effecient and saftey systems.Saftey first, each room has a fire sprinkler and a monitored,hard wired smoke alarm.Additionally there are monitored smoke/carbon detection monitors in the hallways.Beyound that, the house was designed using the Home Energy Rating System or HERS,that increases energy effeciency up to 50% through use of increased insulation and energy effecient windows and doors.The house will be heated by natural gas and a outdoor energy effecient/low emmision wood fired water boiler .So the plan is to have  tenant spaces.The price range is from  rooms to go for $550{including heat,hot water,wi-fi,cable TV}to $625.Beyond that, oh boy.The house itself is on 40 acres of land,however, it's surrounded by Nature Conservancy, State land, so it's extemely rural.Beyond that it's on a limited access road, with further dedicated nature trails, a large brook.Beyond that, Lyme itself is a paradise.Through zoning laws they have kept the population very low and aggresively purchased land for nature preserves.As a result, it's like stepping back into the 1850's.You can bike for miles on country roads, very little vehicular traffic.On the weekends you can go two days without seeing another human face with little planning.Nature in the raw.I find it's a very effective way to unwind, get away from the rat-race, and get in touch with yourself and your projects.Nature is so begnin, a force for good,to just immerse yourself in it.We are up and running.

We are Modern-Day Plain Pioneers

A group of Modern-Day individuals and/or families working together to live a self sufficient, off grid, organic, all natural, plain, old fashioned, simple life. With Amish and Mennonite LIKE attitudes, morals and values, a plain, simple group. We share many commonalities and values similar to the aforementioned groups while expressing some very different views. 

A few examples of the differences are: we do not require any individual to live a non-resistant life, wear a head covering or submit to specific dress codes except while staying at our home.

 You may drive a vehicle, use Internet and electricity in your home. Those choices belong to each individual, although modesty is always required. 

In our home the ladies wear simple, modest dresses below the knees and head covers. (1st Corinthians 11) 
Aprons are often worn by the ladies. The men wear long pants most times, shorts must come to the knees. No sleeveless shirts, no print, brand labels or advertisements on clothing.  Men keep their hair short, facial hair is a personal choice. The ladies keep their hair long and pinned up under a cover. 

Visitors would be asked to conform to our dress code while staying at our homestead. Full time residents whom own their own place and live at their own places full time, can set their own guidelines. More detailed information will be provided during the interview process. 

Musical instruments, travel, higher education and technology are not forbidden. Each family should decide what influences and to what extent they feel are best for them. We do encourage every person to guard themselves from being exposed to too much modern stress, becoming imprisoned or dependent on modern conveniences. 

In our home we do not have TV, but we will watch some DVDs. You won't find a curling iron, makeup or a toaster oven. Video games are very rare indeed. Instead you will find us shucking corn together outside or hoeing the garden rows, mowing grass, weaving rugs, splitting firewood or churning butter....  We even observe electricity-FREE days each month. 

Men and women have separate work projects and sleeping areas. We have gender specific roles and are VERY conservative. Our homestead functions like the old fashioned pioneer homesteads. Leave your modern attire, music and such, carefully packed away in your car or better yet: leave it at home before you come visit us. 

We prefer old fashioned clothing, music and activities from the pioneer days. Think: Little House On The Prairie

Grace is said at every meal, church on Sunday's. We may have a glass of wine with dinner but no exorbitant alcohol use. Smoking is frowned upon and drugs are strictly forbidden. 


We are Holy Spirit filled Christians. We keep the bible in it's entirety, and the leading voice of the precious Holy Spirit as our guide for life. We attend a local Mennonite church but are not members. 

If you are leaving the Amish or Mennonite groups and wish to keep with a plain lifestyle, you may feel comfortable here. If you are seeking to join a community that is similar in ways to the Amish or Mennonites, you may feel comfortable here. If you have always felt that you were born 100 years too late, you may feel comfortable here. 

A lifestyle of living off the land, making your own from nature and old fashioned hand tools. We use tractors and engines as needed. Raising your own foods, animals and using them to feed your family. Not dependent on &quot;the system&quot;, but free from the imprisonment of it.

Deriving freedom from your own land and networking with like minded people to accomplish the common goals.

We would like to form a local, living, breathing, community, made up of hard working, able bodied, committed people to live and work together. We can develop friendships as well as depression proof homesteads. Share meals, joys, worship services and hardships together. Occasionally offering a work-to-stay program. 

Children can grow up in the proper care of parents and good friends, and will be home schooled by the loving care of their parents. Your bodies nourished from the bountiful fruits of the land. Health protected from illness and sicknesses treated by nature.

Come pioneer this group and live like the REAL Pioneers did.
We are seeking individuals and families that want to live within driving
distance of each other. Encouraging private property ownership, but willing to accommodate a small number of people on our land short term, with the intention of helping them to relocate here on their own property.

At present we have 6 families within our network, of a 3 mile radius. We have 1 male farm-hand apprentice, living at our homestead full time. 

We observe a reasonably set schedule:
M-Sat
Up at 5am
Ready to work by 6am
Breakfast from 8-9am
Back to work by 9am
Lunch from 12-1pm
Free time from 1-4pm
Meal prep 4pm
Dinner and fellowship from 5-7pm
Clean up/projects until 8pm
*Sundays are subject to church, project plans and weather. 
*All visitors and residents are required to participate in activities according to the above schedule. 

(You should be dressed, hair pinned up and covered, ready for work by 6am each morning)

We will be accepting applications for visitors to stay short term on a work exchange basis. You will have space for primitive camping, 3 meals PER WORK DAY and training/hands on education in day to day simple living skills, in exchange for your free labor. Limited internet access. 

Minimum visiting periods are 3 days, more commonly people stay for 1-2 weeks. If we all get along well, you could be invited to stay longer and/or return later. Best times of the year for visiting is between April through October. Be prepared to work outside mostly. This is rice country and we are surrounded by flooded fields that breed heavy swarms of Mosquitos. We recommend you begin a sulphur regimen 30 days before coming here. 

You don't work- you don't eat. If you take a day off, you will have to fend for yourself. Full water/electric/Internet/camping privileges as well as 3 hefty, home raised/home made meals per day= 4-6 hours of work from each adult per day. The amount of hours work to earn your keep varies depending on your skill level and abilities. 

Please email us with your interest for this type of opportunity. We will return your email with an interview process, application and further requirements. A minimum of 2 weeks notice before intended arrival is requested. 

Please tell us all about yourself and your family. Tell us how you are actively working towards a more self sufficient life. We would be interested to know how self sufficient you are now, and how far you are seeking to go!

You wake up with the sun hitting your face from through the hull window of our boat. You take a look at everything around you and feel a sense of pride for all the hard work we have put into creating what we have. You feel great honor to know you belong to something so awesome and different. You spend a few hours each day doing some chores or sailing our vessel. Visit some distant and remote islands to look for coconuts, pineapples, mangoes and bananas or hunt for some wild boar or dive for lobster. Lounge on the beach, play some volleyball, dive on a reef and swim around or head back to the boat to relax and take a shower. Play some guitar and sit around a bonfire drinking some homemade coconut/mango/pineapple rum. Sharing stories of our awesome adventures and travels together, gazing at the stars, the fire and the ocean... you get this amazing feeling of accomplishment, unity, peace. Your mind is clear, you feel complete, you're here with us, in this moment, in-tune with yourself, your surroundings, the world, the whole universe. Welcome to SV Oikos.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21865&quot;&gt;Wyomanock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to grow a community that values and cultivates a supportive network of friends, who would like to engage in farm-based sustainable lifestyle practices, and who strive to reduce their carbon footprint as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/wyomanock/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/wyomanock/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hello!  Our vision is to establish an intentional community on 74 acres of land that we own in the upper Taconic Valley of New York, just west of the the Berkshire/Taconic range.  The land has a mix of fertile fields, ponds, streams, meadows, wetlands and forest.  We are not far from cultural centers and small cities including Pittsfield and the Berkshire region.  Our space is home to Wyomanock Farm and Wyomanock Center for Sustainable Living.  

Wyomanock Farm cultivates three quarters of an acre of organically grown vegetables, raises a flock of about 100 free range laying hens (on pasture and fed organic, local grain), and has a small herd of Scottish Highland Cattle for beef production.  We enjoy producing as much of our own food as possible.  In 2014, we established a small on-site farm stand which is open year-round.  With additional help on the farm, we'd like to attend local farmers markets and develop local or regional wholesale markets. 

Wyomanock Center for Sustainable Living was founded in 2010.  It is a nonprofit educational organization dedicated to increasing public understanding of sustainable living through experiential learning opportunities. We work with individuals, groups, and the community to encourage sustainability by fostering an appreciation of the natural environment; by demonstrating organic agriculture, renewable energy, and natural building; and by encouraging a locally-based economy and healthy, culturally rich community.  Since its inception, Wyomanock Center has offered events, farm and nature based educational workshops, regular monthly potlucks, a solstice celebration, film viewings on our focus topics, assisting with the development of a community garden in a nearby urban area, and solar shower community construction project.

We are looking for others with similar values and ambitions, including a desire to live simply, people who continuously work to incorporate sustainable practices into their lifestyle, and who have a desire to be a part of the Farm and Center in some capacity.  We welcome people of any age, ethnic and religious background, sexual orientation, gender identity, and dietary philosophies/needs.

A little background:  Thom purchased the land in 2002, started living here full time in 2003 with his two young sons, and began developing the Farm and Center in 2010.  Julie met Thom in 2012 at a local farming conference and moved to the land in late 2013.  Since that time, we have been working to further develop the Farm, Center, and Intentional Community.  Over the past few years we have had several individuals live here for varying lengths of time and with varied levels of involvement in the work we are doing.  At this moment, it's just us two!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21866&quot;&gt;2BD Termined&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Faithist, vegetarian, pacifist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/2bd-termined/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/2bd-termined/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The purpose of this community will be to provide a way for people to live wholesome, productive, sustainable lives.  A cooperative lifestyle can do this - I've seen it - living in a way that reduces the illusion of separateness - from the spirit, from the earth and from each other. To this end, I would like to establish a community of people with faith in The One Great Spirit, who are vegan/vegetarian and who are pacifists (interdependent, no?)  I've been saving for this for many years and have purchased 5.5 acres of bottom land with a beautiful creek about 5 miles from Columbia, a semi-progressive college town in central Missouri.  I've invested just about my entire retirement savings in this and would expect a similar investment from anyone who wishes to join.

If you meet the three criteria and are ready to begin the adventure, contact me.  I'll serve as a message center until/if we need an email list or web site.  Contact information on my web site (www.centralmissourigrainsforfood.com).

Update: Building a barn, trying to establish gardens and native tree orchards.

Update: I found a great book on communities: Diana Leafe Christian's &quot;Creating a Life Together&quot;.  This book covers well all of the issues encountered in forming a community.

We are currently maintaining most of our focus on expanding our education programs. Our intentional community is naturally forming around our Education and Transformation Center. Circle of Children is currently planning and preparing for our spring/summer programs. We are offering many unique hands-on educational opportunities for all ages! If you are interested in learning sustainable living skills and community building, we would like to invite you to inquire about a visit to our center in Oregon and explore the possibilities of collaboration. 

Circle of Children is a growing free alternative school dedicated to honoring the spirit of the child. We are located on a fully-developed conference center on 60 acres of pristine land in the foothills of Oregon’s Coastal Mountain Range. This land was donated to Circle of Children in January 2012 to build a children-centered eco-village and community school. 

We provide an enriched environment for individuals to connect with nature, explore their natural curiosities, and discover their own unique gifts, talents, and skills. Our curriculum gives children the inspiration, wisdom, tools, and resources to create a brighter future for our planet.

Our educational model offers a hands-on project and service-based curriculum primarily led by youth. These projects empower youth, grow and sustain our school, unite and assist local and global organizations, inspire and activate world change, while creating a blueprint for harmonious living.

• Earth Stewardship 
• Creative Arts

We each built our own houses to suit us and are living harmoniously, sharing resources and friendship.  Our community is diverse and we have many artists who have joined us to live and work in community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/valverde-commons/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/valverde-commons/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Valverde Commons was conceived as an active adult CoHousing community in 2006 and developed from pastureland starting in 2011.   Currently there are 22 energy efficient houses with 6 additional ones expected by 2023.  Thirty four people live in the community as of 2018.   The community is located in the heart of Taos, New Mexico and a short walk from the historic Taos Plaza.  

The individual homes are clustered on 10 acres surrounding an almost 4 acre common green space, plus an adjacent 10 acre park with walking paths and gardens. 

Our beautiful common house has a full kitchen, large meeting room, library, and laundry facilities. It is frequently used for group dining, parties, meetings, classes, and entertainment. The common house has rooftop solar energy to promote sustainability.  We also have a barn building for communal garden tools, tractor, and garden carts.  The barn also includes a complete professional wood working shop and other studio facilities. 

Valverde Commons provides the feel of an old-time neighborhood where everyone knows everyone else and frequently get together for group meals, educational and recreational activities.  The network of paths around the commons area provides neighbors easy opportunity to meet and commune with each other.

Adjacent to Taos’s historical district, Valverde Commons is within easy walking distance of Taos Plaza, the Taos library, stores, art galleries and restaurants. Valverde Commons includes a diversity of people of different backgrounds, incomes and viewpoints who want to live harmoniously.  We have a number of resident artists and feature art shows in our Common House.

Valverde Commons has considerable neighbor participation in group activities such as potluck dinners, garden work days, astronomy sky parties, hikes, movies,  horseshoes, educational discussions and decision making management but we also have a policy of voluntary participation in all these events.  As a community, we get along well. 

We are committed to aging in place as much as possible. We are not health-care professionals, but we expect to be helpful neighbors, supporting each other physically, emotionally, and spiritually as we age.

As of summer 2018, we have two houses for sale.  One of those houses may be rented for short times to experience CoHousing.  Email us for more information and visit our website (www.valverdecommons.com).</description>

The Rochester Folk Art Guild is a community of people sharing the aim of working practically toward a deeper understanding of themselves and their purpose, based on the teaching of G.I. Gurdjieff. Our crafts and community life provide ways to cultivate a special quality of attention amidst the activities of daily life. This is the core practice of what is most often called simply 'The Gurdjieff Work.'

We live and work on a 350 acreare a farm in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York between Canandaigua and Keuka lakes.  This Guild center is the home of an intentional community with an established tradition of organic agriculture, fine craft work, and personal development.  Organic practices have been used in fruit and vegetable production for the 40 years the Guild has been at its current rural location.  A seven year-old market garden with greenhouse sells to the community through farmers markets and a CSA. Projects include organic gardens, orchards, vineyards, food preservation (mainly canning and freezing), sustainable forestry &amp; firewood production, general building &amp; grounds maintenance and construction. There are also opportunities to explore the crafts that are practiced here - ceramics and woodworking in particular (though there are weaving, sewing, boat building and blacksmithing shops as well).

We welcome visitors who are sincerely searching for new ways to learn and to be - those willing to work hard and value the joys of a simple rural life

We are a treesort just within the small village of Quebrada Grande de Nandayure.  We are  4 families with 10 children between us, though everybody is not here all the time.  
We have a treehouse for rent, with plans on building more. We also have camping space and other small houses in the Tico village for rent.
 We are into restoration of the land, and building a relationship with the Earth.  Also we understand that true freedom means growing our own food or finding it in the community.

 We are creators of Heaven on Earth. We welcome you to come and help us work towards our goal, provided you can take of yourself.

Our goal is to focus on being an economic resource that helps to make the  community sustainable. One of our main priorities the is production of sustainable and local food, for ourselves, and helping the locals to learn how to farm organically.

The Sanctuary in South Sweden is located in a serene nature reserve embraced by the beautiful Eko-park of Christine Hof Castle and the shores of the Baltic sea adorned with ancient standing stones. It forms a magical triangle with the stunning medical chi gong centre www.yangtorp.com and the green yoga castle of www.srivast.org both approximately 20min away.
Österlen is the coste d’azur of Scandinavia with its charming coastlines filled with cozy cafes, galleries and studios of artists from all creative expressions. ’Lilla Raa’ - one of the first raw food cafes of Sweden is situated in the nearby Kivik close to Stenhuvud National Park and the famous organic garden of Eden crafted by www.mandelmann.se. 

The Sanctuary can be reached from international airport Copenhagen and Malmö or by Ferry from Germany and Poland in only 1hr to 90 min maximum. What is unique about the Sanctuary besides its prime location is its access to pure drinking water drawn from an 80 meters deep well uncontaminated and free from any industrial pollution. The clean air and golden silence offers a break from sound pollution and allows deep rest and rejuvenation. The Sanctuary is surrounded by 6500 year old stone circles and ancient ceremonial sites which add to a mystic vibration offering an ideal environment for spiritual development and healing work.

The vision of the Sanctuary is to grow into a sustainable oasis and stepping stone through global major changes on the planet offering refuge for those who need healing and resetting of bearings.
More resources are needed to establish solar, wind and phyto sewage systems as well as organic permaculture designs, greenhouses and organic seed preservation vaults for the future generations.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21873&quot;&gt;Gay Men's Rural Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are a group of Gay Men interested in forming a Community of like minded individuals. We will not discriminate and welcome anyone who is open minded and accepting. We envision a diverse open minded community that any open minded individual would be welcomed and made to feel at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/gay-mens-rural-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/gay-mens-rural-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;NOTE: This community is in the beginning planning stages. It will be several years before breaking ground. Also, the name will be determined by the founding group and will be a diverse open-minded group of Men, Women and Children. We will welcome anyone who is also open-minded.

This community is in the planning phase. We do not currently have a community and do not anticipate breaking ground until 2020-2025. We realize this is a long way off but we are working behind the scenes while we wait for the land to be released from a tax benefiting partnership. We are a group of Gay Men interested in forming a Community of like minded individuals. We will not discriminate and welcome anyone who is open minded and accepting.

The community is a Rural one that will be located in the deep South on several rural acres. We welcome anyone with serious interests to join us in the planning.

Subject to changes in the planning phase this community will be made up of 32 owner occupied houses/condos with a starting price of around $99k to $129k.

The project will include a common house for shared meals (though individual units will all have kitchens) and other social opportunities. There will also be other common buildings such as an outdoor terrace, pool, hot tub, fitness center,  library, gardens, bike paths, storage and office space will be available for rent. We are also considering the addition of a few studio apartments that could be rented out.

To contact this community via mail please send correspondence to Boxholder, PO Box 34315 Phoenix, AZ 85067-4315

In 2015 we completed our subdivision process and sold 5 3-acre lots within the ecovillage to like-minded friends into personal growth and sustainability.  The community owns a 10 acre parcel in the back of the subdivision.  We started building in 2016.  We now have a beautiful dance/yoga/multipurpose space with an 1800 sq. ft. wooden dance floor as well as dining for 60, a glorious wood-fired hot tub, tons of food from the land such as: papayas, mangos, avocados, bananas, and many other exotic fruits.  

The vision is for the Lolia Community LLC to own title to the property and lease the land to the Lolia Foundation which will run the center and host courses and events that support our values.  We invite wwoofers and interns to join us and have an extended opportunity to live the practices of conscious sensuality and permaculture on a daily basis.

We are located near Kehena Beach, a clothing optional black sand beach and is an awesome place for yoga, swimming, snorkeling, and often frequented by dolphins who love to swim with people.  We are a 20 minute drive from our local town of Pahoa and 45 minutes from the city of Hilo and the airport.  The biking along the Puna coast on the red road is wonderful.
  
We share space so there is an opportunity to realize our true nature in the reflection of others.  There is plenty of space in nature around here for times of solitude, reflection and grounding.  There is also time to make money working in or outside the community.

We host the annual Hawaii Tantra Festival, Conscious Sensuality courses and many other events.</description>

Greetings from a small group of friends and families lving in the community.We have a registered charity  under th rules and regulations of our Indian government to help the weeker sections in the villages and slums to show our friendship and fellowship both in words and in deeds.

We are using our small resources for the benefit of the rural community with the cooperation and coordination of our local government officials and other Non-Governmental Organasiations

A friend is one of God's greatest blessings. But friends do not just happen.

 
Please note this following;

I WENT OUT TO FIND A FRIEND, BUT COULD NOT FIND ONE THERE.I WENT OUT TO BE FRIEND AND FRIENDS WERE EVERYWHERE!

In times of trouble friends can give encouragement and understanding. In times of temporal need they can give assistance.

In times of weakness they can give much strength. In times of joy they can rejoice with us.

In times of sorrow they can give sympathy and comfort. And also they are one of the greatest motivating influences in helping us grow strong in the Lord. With a friend we can share the hidden thoughts of the heart. 

We can share joys and sorrows, happiness and despair, laugh and shed tears with out being ashamed. Solomon said, &quot; A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.&quot; (Proverbs17;17)

A friend is a friend even when we are in adverse circumstances or in trouble or in sickness.

 Friend ship does not depend upon our material situation, possessions or circumstances. Friendship knows no barriers of race, religion or social position.

When our friends have need of us- our time, our possessions-we will be thankful for the opportunity to serve, to share, to be a part of the solution, to be a concerned listener, no matter what the need may be, nor how untimely it may be for us.

We are inviting individuals and families from all over the world to join with us to love one another, and shre the recources for caring others who in need.

We request gifts and donations both in cahs and in kind for the bemnefit of the community and share to feed  and educate the poor and needy.


Friendly Yours,

Madhava,

 Founder &amp; Trustee.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21878&quot;&gt;Coho Canyon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Bay Area home for a small, eco-conscious group whose passion is to use the land for service work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/coho-canyon/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/coho-canyon/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Coho Canyon is a micro-community founded in 1991 and best defined as a micro-village, cooperative or LLC.  Located in the hills of the San Geronimo Valley in West Marin, County, California, we are in possession of two adjoining, south-facing parcels neighboring 170 acres of undeveloped, natural forest.  
 Currently, we have three partners and are open to adding additional partners.  Anyone interested should know that Marin County real estate is  very pricey and, unfortunately, we are encumbered with a high monthly mortgage.  A down payment for new members is in the neighborhood of $100K.  Also, new partners would start out renting one of Coho Canyon's detached dwellings for up to two years before becoming a new partner.  New partners will be able to manifest their ideas suitable for their needs.  It could be as simple as a tenants in common where a vegetable garden is the only thing that is shared, or the new partners could agree on sharing all kinds of facilities which might include kitchens, workshops, yurts, etc.  
At this point in time what we have to offer is the land and two dwellings to get started but, unlike many other cohousing groups, who already have created a well defined community, we are in the early stages and open to many ideas that the new partners envision.

We are looking for individuals who wish to work diligently in the gardens to harvest Glorious fruit of the Earth. We are looking for individuals who are willing to help raise a child. We are looking for individuals who can see themselves building programs, schools, and A New Earth. We are looking for individuals who are willing to test themselves and measure their Limits, while feeling Safe and Nurtured by the Earth and its Loving inhabitants.

The Responsibility of Carrying the Light on this Earth is not casual. It requires Commitment. It requires Faith. And, it requires Trust.

We trust that the right men or women will have faith in Who they Are and will contact us when they are ready to explore this monumental opportunity. 
The winter is severe; snow tires are necessary, manual labor is inevitable, and difficulties will arise. However, We Are All In This Together.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21881&quot;&gt;La Poudrière&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To prove that a new and better life is possible when people, even poor or without high education, decide to live together and put their forces in common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/la-poudriere/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/la-poudriere/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
La Poudrière is a French-speaking, income-sharing community of about 55 people living in three locations in Belgium: Brussels, Péruwelz and Rummen, and is a member of the Emmaus International network. We were founded in 1958. The five aims we gradually came to defining for ourselves are: 1. presence among people not sharing our lifestyle (we refuse to cut ourselves off from society), 2. friendship, 3. justice and equity among us and in the world, 4. utopia: hope to help building a new world, and 5. ascesis and personal growth. To realize these aims, we rely on four tools: 1. work; 2. sharing, especially incomes; 3. a simple lifestyle; 4. fidelity to the people and aims of the community.
	Members work every working day from 8 am to 5.15 pm in the community business (collecting and reselling old furniture, clothes, etc.), in the various tasks involved by community life (maintenance of our equipments and buildings, office work...), or running our farm in Rummen. A few members have a job outside the community and give their salary to the community; as are given, as a rule, all regular incomes. Every member receives € 30,00 a week, but basic needs are provided by the community, including transportation inside the country. Vehicles are shared (to use them, one must be accepted as a community driver by our Monthly Meeting, see below) and fuel is payed by the community.
	Assistance to meals on working days, to meetings, and to organized feasts is required. A core group holds a meeting once a month (the Monthly Meeting) to discuss more delicate matters and takes decisions by consensus only. These decisions are submitted to the approval of the whole community at our Spaghetti Meeting, also hold once a month. Some important decisions may be taken directly by the head of the community, Vanni Mocutti, who has been in charge since the death of the foundator, Father Léon Van Hoorde, in 1996.</description>

We envision a school/healing center/retreat where people can come to learn about sustainable living, natural health, and can participate in helping to build the community.
and we want to teach children by intentional community.

Goals for this group:
- Organically grow fruits, herbs, and vegetables
- education in intentional community
- Reduce, reuse, repurpose, and recycle
- Leave a smaller carbon footprint
- Share resources and land to lower cost of living
- Build structures from natural healthy materials
- Create a low-stress environment and have fun in the process

This is a thoughtfully planned village, promoting sustainability of natural resources &amp; human community, with the intent towards extending this spirit into the neighborhood &amp; the world. 

Are you an artist or sculptor or musician, writer or healer, creative spirit or part of the cultural creatives? Would you like wide open spaces and incredible views, while sitting at the foot of beautiful Pedernal Mountain, right in the heart of Georgia O’Keeffe country?  This is an opportunity to become a part of a small community of like-minded people while having a place to come to do your creative, life's work.

The land is approximately 62 acres that will be commonly owned and shared. The Village itself is 16 home sites with 15 sites clustered around a 6+ acre plaza on the canyon rim, overlooking the Rio Puerco and the entrance of Abiquiu Lake.

Several lots are available for sale, with the purchaser then having the freedom to build their own casita, within the framework of Village guidelines for architecture and sustainable elements. This community is on the frontier of defining new ways of living, and you are invited to join in if this concept resonates in your body, mind and spirit.

We are a community of artists, ecologists and students. We live together for the enjoyment of community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sushi-tribe/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sushi-tribe/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Co-op with mostly college aged individuals, but also with older adults and children running around. We are a group of musicians, artists, students, spiritual seekers, and farmers brought together by interests in communal living, sustainable practices and fun loving vibes. We like to party, but not excessively. We also appreciate various spiritual practices and hard work on important causes and projects.

The house has been active since 2007.  The community began developing through a weekly gathering 3 years prior, with no community house intended.  For our first 5 years, our &quot;Alternative Library&quot; made the house a public space.  The &quot;Alt Lib&quot; has sense found it's permanent location nearby.  Other projects which have originated from our house include the B-Ham Friday Food Not Bombs, which feeds free vegan meals downtown weekly, and Bellingahm Body Rights (BodyRights.INFO), which organizes our local naked bike ride (BellinghamNakedBikeRide.com) among other body-positive campaigns. We have a healing room with tinctures, a massage table, and meditation/reiki space. We have a jam room with various musical instruments. Located in the center of town, easy biking distance to the ocean, university, downtown, and mountains!

We are open to hosting respectful and fun travelers for up to 5 days in exchange for work-trade, pending they have a host within the house.  Contact us if you would like to visit.  Membership and other requests are decided at house meetings, every Sunday at 7pm (8pm in summer).  Meetings are open to the public, and a great way to meet us!  Also ask us about events we have planned for the near future.  We would love to see you!!

Indigene Community is based in providing organizing tools in the 'indigenous' (Latin 'self-generating') 'economy' (Greek 'oikos' = 'home' + 'namein' = 'care-&amp;-nurture') tradition for people right where they live. Our planning is for people cataloguing, exchanging, using &amp; accounting for their talents, goods, services in a Community Investment &amp; Exchange System. CIES  called 'Do-we-know-who-we-are-?'. Our web-programmers are developing Open-Source software for our online web-based Human Resource Catalogue HRC Resource Mapping &amp; accounting for economic transactions in a Community Investment &amp; Exchange System CIES. We work with a community value called a 'Mem' (as 'memory' for all community contributions), which is based on an hour of work at Quebec minimum-wage. As a system of progressive ownership folks develop ownership in the CIES with their participatory contributions into Founder, Worker, Supplier or Consumer Associations. https://sites.google.com/site/indigenecommunity/structure/9-do-we-know-who-we-are

70% of people live in multihome dwelling complexes (Longhouse/apartment, Pueblo/townhouse &amp; Kanata/village) with an average of 32 dwellings for about 100 people. 100 people is the critical mass all humanity's worldwide indigenous ancestors sought. 100 people provides economies of scale for self-generating economies around food, shelter, clothing, warmth &amp; health when combined with the worldwide use in Production-Society/Guilds indigenous (string-shell) time-based progressive ownership accounting. RELATIONAL ECONOMY section of our website provides a humber of pages on different aspects of indigenous multistakeholder participatory economic accounting. https://sites.google.com/site/indigenecommunity/relational-economy

'Indigene' (Latin = 'self-generating') Tiohtiake 'Community' (L = 'com' = 'together' + 'munus' = 'gift or service')
LaSalle-Gardens Mutual Aid Committee function.  Individuals interested in working with us gain better idea from communication &amp; involvement in our ecological, environmental, elemental, economic, ergonomic &amp; engineering enhancement projects with multifamily (apartment &amp; townhouse) housing development.  We're working together to establish urban based ecological community in the greater Montreal region called Tiohtiake ('place where the nations &amp; their rivers unite &amp; divide') in Mohawk.

We're inspired by humanity's universal indigenous traditions based in multi-family planning, accounting recognition for all labour inputs through 'Production Societies' (Guild-like organisations involving progressive ownership from youth to elder involvement).  We're planning for ecological design with sun &amp; other elements, ergonomic with the human body &amp; economic with participant livelihood well-being. We expect to build safe, healthy fire resistant self-sufficient buildings with green-roof, precipitation gathering, urine-fecal separating green humanure toilets, grey water recycling etc. Our internal structuring involves both 'Consensus' ('reaching for common values' and respecting 'common interest') &amp; 'Caucusing' (Iroquois = 'grouping of like interests' or 'cultivation of diversity') among multi-stakeholder Founders, Workers, Suppliers &amp; Consumers.  A Human Resource Catalogue facilitates participation among intentional members &amp; larger community.  We expect to work within existing economic structures &amp; help them work sustainably.

We work contractually (written agreements), by accounting for contributions at market rates each individual developing credits.  Every transaction involves investment through Production Societies. Individuals develop equity ownership (charged at market rates) in condominium units as well as being given the opportunity &amp; accounting recognition for participation in commmon area functions.  Our target is to have approximately 100 individuals (35 households)living adjacent (private &amp; independent 'partements' at market costs)with opportunities &amp; accounting recognition to contribute to common area functions &amp;
&lt;/div&gt;

To gather in circle to co-create ceremony in giving gratitude to the elements that sustain us. To garden and eat from the fruits of our labor in a sacred way. To follow Permaculture principles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/land-of-dawes-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/land-of-dawes-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Earth spirituality community now forming on 38 acres of forest and field off the grid near Ithaca, NY. Looking for a handful of good friends to live together on the land and co-create a community striving for sustainable, self-sufficiency, and a shared reverence for the earth that is our only home.  We gather in co-created ceremonies to give gratitude to the elements that sustain us: Earth, Air, Fire and Water. We invite families and friends to circle on the eight cross-quarters on the medicine wheel, to re-align ourselves to the earth's cycles and seasons. Potluck, bonfire, sauna are shared at the end of each gathering.
Poetry, song, chants and drumming, meditation and creative visualization are shared.
We have organic gardens, concord grapes, blueberries and a maple grove and evaporator to name a few of our permaculture crops. There is a pond and sauna. We have solar energy and a generator to take care of our electric needs but value our small footprint on the earth. There is barn space potentially for animals but is also used as a workshop. There is presently a small cabin available for living space for one or two more people.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21888&quot;&gt;Finca Nuevo Mundo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Green New World is a non-profit organization dedicated to developing autonomous and regenerative residential models such as Project HOPE that empowers people to live an ecological and carbon free lifestyle. Green New World is committed to research, design and education of novel regenerative methods and technology that provide solutions to energy, water, waste, shelter and food production. Our designs utilize an integrative whole system approach to integrate technologies from various fields such as biomimicry, permaculture design, holistic sciences, vernacular architecture, biophilia and biotechture. Green New World's first carbon negative residential prototype, HOPEone is anticipated to be completed by 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/124679/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/124679/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Green New World’s educational research center, Finca Nuevo Mundo is being developed in the valley of Tzununa close to the shores of Lake Atitlan in the Highlands of Guatemala to experiment and showcase regenerative and sustainable living models while restoring harmony with nature. Our models integrate principles and designs from numerous fields such as permaculture, biophilic design, holistic sciences, biomimicry, vernacular biotechture and appropriate technology with focus on shelter, water, energy, food and zero waste systems. 

The project site has 10 acres with an avocado forest, shaded coffee, bananas, papayas, citrus trees, 6 mountain springs, three streams, waterfalls nearby and great views of the lake and surrounding volcanoes.  As part of the experience at Finca Nuevo Mundo we like to share our lifestyle as a community by living ecologically and being mindful stewards in our daily choices while we share the space as a community by sharing meals, exploring the beautiful area, playing music or have meaning full conversations. While not engaged with the project there are plenty of activities in the area such as visiting nearby waterfalls, going for a swim in the lake, exploring the beautiful area, kayaking, visiting the neighboring villages, taking a Spanish class,  playing music, taking yoga classes, taking a sauna, or simply having good conversations with the amazing people that our project attracts. 

We are currently building a Net Zero Carbon Negative model home known as the House Of PeacE aka HOPE which is an experimental prototype to develop autonomous regenerative residential buildings. The structure consists of a cluster of four interwoven domes out of Superadobe also known as Earthbags that form a peace symbol. HOPE integrates a holistic water system with a rain catchment, a water recycling system where every drop of water is used 4 times, natural grey-water filters, a hybrid renewable energy system and a sewage recycling system to make biogas while capturing atmospheric carbon dioxide and converting it to organic fertilizer and soil amendments.

Inspired by master yogi Baba Hari Dass and founded in 1981, the Salt Spring Centre of Yoga is the oldest spiritual retreat centre on Canada's west coast. We run yoga retreats and yoga teacher training programs, and we also rent our facility to like-minded groups. In addition, we also operate a small scale organic farm that helps to feed our residents and guests. Most of the work done at the Centre is on a volunteer basis, and each year we also offer multiple sessions of our 10-week residential karma yoga program, which includes instruction in yoga theory and practice. We typically have between 20 and 40 residents during the late spring, summer, and early fall, and a much smaller residential community from December through March. 

The Centre sits on 69 acres of land in the heart of scenic Salt Spring Island. Six acres are farmed organically and most of the produce goes to our kitchen for residents and guests. We have a small alternative school (K-6) and a wellness centre providing Ayurvedic and other treatments. 

We welcome applications for our Residential Karma Yoga program, and we also have periodic job opportunities that pay a small stipend that are available for skilled workers. For details, as well as information about other opportunities to stay at the Centre--like facility rentals, personal retreats and other retreats--please see our website at www.saltspringcentre.com

Realizing that these guidelines rely on inspiration rather than rules:
  In order to truly love and live peacefully, we are willing to recognize and relinquish all fear-driven beliefs, judgments and separate needs, supporting each other in this process.  We recognize that healing occurs through forgiveness we manifest daily.  We experience the simple joy &amp; laughter that community offers, living simply as a means to this end.  We choose to participate in and develop a sustainable lifestyle, composting, gardening, conserving electricity, water, fuel and other resources.
  We commit to working as needed on household chores at least 5 hours each week.  There is no alcohol consumption or illegal drug use in the house.  Rent is paid monthly, up front.  The food receipts are split at the end of the month.  Food is shared by all members, taking into account individual preferences.  Group meals are encouraged, those not cooking are encouraged to clean up.  Decisions are reached by consensus at weekly meetings (see below); participation is expected. 
  Consensus - With respect for the views of all, we work to find solutions as a group for the good of the group.  No one is wrong.  We continue to examine all concerns until agreement is reached.
  We hold weekly dinners, monthly movie nights and facilitate ACIM classes at the Peace-atorium, inviting the larger community to join us.  We have sponsored a permaculture design course from April-July 2012. Check the Events Calendar on this web site or contact us for details and dates.

a centre to invest in...

People buying a loft here do so because they love the idea of converting an industrial building into a co-housing development based on renewable energy sources.

We're building BBC style (batiment basse consommation!) which means low on energy and energy bills!

A sustainable lifestyle means sharing things when it makes sense to share: communal ecological garden, spare bedrooms for friends, laundry centre, DIY workshop, room for training/art/dance/theatre. Future plans include electric cars for shorter journey travelling, freshwater swimming pool and well-being centre.

The site is set in a beautiful natural environment a few hundred metres from the small village of Montolieu which has kindergarten and primary schools, shops, chemist, bakery, restaurants.

The village of roughly 750 inhabitants is 18 Km from Carcassonne, famous for it double walled medieval city and the Canal du Midi.

Montolieu is situated in South-West France, between Toulouse and Narbonne in the foothills of the Black Mountain, overlooking the Pyrenees across the Lauragais plain.

It is located 90min outside of Melbourne's CBD north between the Goulbourn and the Yarra Valley, where the community is curently acquiring a large and beautiful piece of farm land. 50% of the land is dedicated to nature and 40% to build Victorias largest permaculture/organic farm. The remaining 10% are dedicated to the village and its employment &amp; leisure infrastructure.

The community is created with the intention of balancing all 4 pillars of sustainability - environmental, social, economic and spiritual - equally. It values indigenous wisdom, heritage, tradition, cultural &amp; religious diversity and invites people from all walks of life to participate.

The goverance model is of sociocratic nature &amp; is value-based to foster respect and tolerance.

All assets of the community, its land, farm and business cooperatives are held by the community through a Community Land Trust, which ensures affordable living (incl. housing, food, water, power and education) for ever.

The village is created, designed and developed in cooperation with the wider community, building strong links between both.

The community is resource-independent by providing its own energy, water, food &amp; workforce. In addition, its community features, healthy environment, organic farm, arts, crafts &amp; innovation precinct, local enterprise &amp; business cooperatives will provide each family with employment.

Various regular farm market days, community events, celebrations &amp; exhibitions will also attract the wider community and others to visit regularly.

There is considerable common land which is currently lawn.
Our concept is for like minded people to purchase the remaining units over time to move to a cohousing shared facilities, shared use cooperative living model. At least one of the current owners is sympathetic. There is a unit currently for sale.
The group operates under a strata title.
There is potential for an orchard, play area, shared rainwater tanks, shared workshop, shared battery storage etc.
If one of the properties next door comes on the market there is the potential to incorporate it into the group with a much larger common area and the use of the existing building for 2/3 additional residences (with the addition of a second story).
As ever one needs patience for the pieces of the puzzle to fall into place. This is a medium to long term project.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21899&quot;&gt;Canopy Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our vision is to build and live in a multi­generational community that:
 - Fosters meaningful connections through supportive relationships
 - Creates and maintains a healthy and ecologically sustainable urban development
 - Demonstrates innovative, attractive cohousing
 - Inspires communities to build the housing they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/toronto-ecohousing-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/toronto-ecohousing-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are a growing group of people in downtown Toronto pursuing the development of a cohousing community and actively seeking new members.  

We come together with like-minded people to live simply, peacefully, and co-operatively. We want to live meaningful lives and be connected to and supported by those around us. We want our children in a safe and nurturing environment. We believe in an ecologically sustainable lifestyle and incorporate environmentally responsible choices as often as possible.  

We cherish and support diverse ages, ethnicities, interests, abilities, incomes, relationships and spiritual beliefs. We strive to be conscious of our words and actions and to be mindful in all of our relationships. We are cultivating a non-judgmental environment based on compassion and acceptance. We are committed to consensus decision-making.

We are seeking a location in the central to west end area of downtown Toronto.  We envision a community of 20 to 30 households with mixed unit sizes (one- two- three- and four-bedroom units).  We are very interested in green building and possibly LEED certification.  We would like to incorporate some affordable housing as well.  Green and natural spaces are very important to us.  We cherish our individual paths of growth and creativity.  We hope to create a peaceful and loving home that allows for individuality and privacy while fully embracing the joys and benefits of community life.

Please contact us for more information or to come to our next information session.  We look forward to connecting with you!

      <name>Mountain View Cohousing Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21900&quot;&gt;Mountain View Cohousing Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; A caring, egalitarian, environmentally sustainable, health-promoting, and fun-filled community built on trust and mutual respect, we are committed to nurturing our growth as individuals, as a community, and as participants in our neighborhood and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/mountain-view-cohousing-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/mountain-view-cohousing-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are in a residential neighborhood 6 blocks from Castro Street (the main street of Mountain View) and downtown amenities (restaurants and sidewalk cafes, bookstores and other shops, the performing arts center and library); near CalTrain, the Light Rail, bus depot, and the weekly farmers' market; adjacent to Landels Elementary School; and close to the Stevens Creek Trail (biking and walking).

Our 19 condominiums are quite large, ranging in size from 1360 to 2090 sq ft.  In addition, we have 6,000 sq ft of shared indoor space. The common house (4000+ sq ft) has facilities for entertainment, exercise, group dining, and crafts. Parking is underground, with some charging stations for electric cars.  We also have a workshop, bicycle and other storage spaces, a large outdoor patio, and shared green space.  A historic farmhouse on the property has been restored, and has space for meetings and guests.

Our buildings are &quot;green&quot; and energy efficient, with universal design and elevator access to all floors. The units are very well insulated to minimize sound transmission and to minimize the need for heating or cooling, regardless of outside temperature. Our community has an organic garden, 20-tree fruit orchard, and flowers.  

The project was designed by members of our cohousing community via design workshops led by architect Chuck Durrett. It has been endorsed by the Greenbelt Alliance for its sustainable features.</description>

      <name>Oakland Morehouse</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21901&quot;&gt;Oakland Morehouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; conscious pleasurable living&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/oakland-morehouse/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/oakland-morehouse/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Oakland Morehouse, aka the Institute of Human Abilities, is the first Morehouse. Our doors have been open as an intentional community since the winter of 1969.

We are a mix of people with differing ages, races and socio/economic backgrounds living in a 100+ year-old purple Victorian in the Lake Merritt area of Oakland. Sometimes we eat together, sometimes we work together on the house, and we generally take care of each other and have fun. We are dedicated to a lifestyle of doing only what we want to do, while being mindful of our responsibilities and our impact on others. We call this &quot;responsible hedonism&quot;.

“Our philosophy is based on the belief that you are perfect, that the world is perfect, and that you are totally responsible for your life. We believe that perfection includes the potential for change.” By permission from the Lafayette Morehouse website

Our egalitarian social system is based the concept of “one no-vote”. In this system every individual has the right to cast an irrevocable no-vote, which permanently vetoes any proposed action. The effect of any disgruntled person having the ability to permanently stop forward motion on a particular course of action has resulted in a great deal of communication and very few no-votes cast. This system of decision-making fosters a level of consideration for the concerns of others and achieving high levels of agreement, which has allowed our group to stay together for many decades – much longer than the average “commune.”

We have weekly house meetings that average about an hour in length. While we don’t have regularly shared meals, there is a dinner available most nights. Each house member also has six hours of shifts a week, during which they can have their attention on the well–being of the physical house and the people in it. 
 

If you want to know more about our unique style of communal living, you are welcome to attend one of our parties or a group. We also contract from Lafayette Morehouse courses in which our philosophy and lifestyle are described in more depth. These courses address group living and critical aspects of human interaction, including, sensuality, communication and man/woman relationships.

There is usually space in our house for enthusiastic participants who want to have more pleasure and consciousness in their lives and who are interested in exploring the More philosophy. For more information on Morehouse go to www.lafayettemorehouse.com.

We are a Pagan group that follow a Kemetic Path (Religion of Ancient Egypt) and seek the Goddess in all things. Our goal is to build a place where discrimination is a thing of the past and acceptance a norm in life. This is a private community, therefore living arrangements are limited and thus, all persons interested are vetted base of community needs. Applicants must be 18 yrs of age or older. Students under 18 must have their parents apply.

Sunflower River is joyfully creating a sanctuary wherein we embody and promote sustainability, spirituality, adaptability &amp;amp; safety within our selves, community, our land, and Gaia.

Sunflower River is a place in which we live in community, in ever-increasing harmony with our ecosystem, striving to balance the needs of that ecosystem with our own needs. It is a place of centeredness in spirit, a refuge and center for our magical workings, a sacred place. It is a place of sacred work as well as sacred play, daily bread work that we recognize as meaningful and self-sustaining, and of celebration of the cycles of nature and our lives. A place where we can strive towards self-sufficiency--growing and raising our own food, creating our own energy with sun and wind power, living in sustainable, earth-friendly dwellings, taking care of each other and sharing resources.

We act as a center for sustainability outreach, of contact with other communities engaged in sustainable or spiritual practices that touch upon ours, of the education of interested people in sustainable and/or pagan spiritual practices.

We are a small, aspiring sustainable farm, on 4 acres, 4 miles south of Albuquerque at 4900-feet elevation. We're in our eleventh year on the land.  There are five Stewards, of whom four are Founding Members, one additional  member, one child, and a diverse community of supporters who volunteer at work parties, purchase produce, and otherwise support the farm.  We are a host farm in the WWOOF internship program; see http://wwoofusa.org/. 

We have a large vegetable garden, and a half-acre of flood-irrigated pasture, but are not selling for market. Our well is off-grid. We raise chickens, turkeys, peafowl and bees. In addition, four humans, one dog, and three cats live on the property. We plan to get goats someday. Upcoming major projects include developing and improving paths on our back acreage, building a living labyrinth, and ongoing housing, greenhouse and barnyard infrastructure. 

Most of us work full-time off the farm.  We are connected by city bus and bicycle routes to Albuquerque. Our land extends back from a semi-rural highway to a tree-lined field with open views of wide green alfalfa fields and the mountains.  

We are a half-mile from the Rio Grande. We are a queer poly pagan community.

Swami Vishnu-devananda founded the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Farm near Grass Valley, California, in 1971. The ashram provides a residential setting where spiritual practitioners of all levels can deepen their practice through the study of classical yoga, meditation and vedanta. It is part of the International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres and is a non-profit organization.  On 80 acres of rolling hills and meadows in the Sierra foothills, it offers a beautiful, secluded location, surrounded by nature.  All of the staff and teachers are volunteers.  The traditional principles underlying the life of the ashram are respect for religious differences, multi-culturalism, multi-ethnicity and multi-disciplinary study.  The Sivananda Ashram Yoga Farm blends Eastern and Western lifestyles– it is open, tolerant and disciplined a the same time. The vision of the ashram is to help all realize their highest potential and find inner peace. Inner peace will bring outer peace.

A semi-rural ecovillage-in-the-making on ten acres of beautiful Northern California land, one mile out of the town of Laytonville. Ten acres have been subdivided into four parcels which allows for the development of new green homes and community space. We partner with the Solar Living Institute (solarliving.org) to host workshops in sustainability.

The vision is to create an &quot;intentional neighborhood&quot; where people live in private homes, next to neighbors they want to live with, and with whom they share community gardens and community structures. One of the goals is to create a &quot;net zero energy&quot; community.

Unlike a lot of rural homesteads, we're walking distance from town, which lowers our carbon footprint and allows us to be more self-sufficient. Ten acres offers abundant space for agriculture, housing, and workshop space. Cultural diversity and the arts are priorities. Work trade and Internship opportunities start in the Spring. See website for details.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21911&quot;&gt;NEXT EVOLUTION COMMUNITY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To create a free thinking, self-sustainable, cooperative eco community that thrives on trust, non-judgement, cooperation, and love. To be free and experience life in a fulfilling, natural, and passionate way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/next-evolution-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/next-evolution-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are creating a self sustainable, eco-village, homesteading community that thrives on egalitarianism (all are equal and share in the decision making), human cooperation, organic living (will grow &amp; raise raw organic foods), aquaculture, green renewable community generated energy, &amp; natural building practices for creating living spaces.  A non-judgmental community for spiritual growth with respect for individual beliefs (open to all faiths &amp; philosophies), promote non-violence &amp; peaceful conflict resolution, natural health through physical fitness (including meditation, yoga), alternative healing &amp; open to other non-traditional healing methods / herbal remedies, and encourage all to express themselves through art and music. 
We are currently seeking workable property where the community can build a large community building, organic permaculture gardens/greenhouse, orchards, work sheds, and private living homes, (maybe a school house).  Would like to co-op through community networking and with local farmers and craftsman.
 This could grow into a teaching ecovillage that holds retreats, workshops, and seminars on this way of life. We have several other viable ideas on community business that would easily thrive (some are already established and proven successful). You should be willing to perform your share of the workload and accept individuality and uniqueness in all people. Core beliefs are to love and accept one another without judgement, strive for peace, support and care for each other, and have mutual respect for each other.
You can become a part of this awesome adventure into clean, healthy, organic living and the study of life and enlightenment. Come where you can fully express your creativity &amp; passion. Together we can create a paradise. Let's do this! 
Please contact me with questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, interest.
See us on Facebook, &quot;next evolution cooperative&quot; Pennsylvania.
Mission Statement: To create a self-sustainable, teaching, eco-village community where all can learn to coexist in peace &amp; harmony, heal &amp; be healthy, grow in spirit, &amp; live naturally. Please contact Frank:

      <name>Mandala</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21912&quot;&gt;Mandala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Land sharing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/mandala/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/mandala/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Mandala is located in the area administered by the Southern Downs Regional Council. It is about 140 km south west of Brisbane and 40 km north east of Warwick, Queensland Australia.

Our 112 hectares occupy part of a valley in the western foothills of the Main Range within easy access to Main Range National Park including some of the finest scenery and best bushwalking in Australia. Lying at an altitude between 530 and 713 metres, Mandala enjoys milder, less humid summers than coastal Queensland and colder winters with frequent frosts.

The country is mostly dry sclerophyll forest merging into wet sclerophyll in the riparian areas adjoining nearly three kilometres of double creek frontage. This creek can become a torrent during wet periods, but dries to a series of water holes in drier times, particularly during winter.

Fifteen shareholder homesites occupy fifteen hectares. The remaining 97 hectares of common land, including the entire riparian area are mostly given over to conservation, however about 20 hectares are set aside for human purposes including grazing areas and our community centre.


Our community centre includes a meeting room, workshop, a shelter shed and camping ground with a BBQ and water supply and accommodation for our tractor and other shared equipment. A permanent pool in the creek supplies our farm-wide water system, which reticulates at high pressure to all homesites. Pedestrian swing bridges provide access to several homesite during the infrequent occasions when the creek is in flood. 

Since Mandala Pty Ltd was formed in 1975; it has remained democratically run organization working to benefit the lives of its members. 
It is less socially structured and ideologically prescriptive than most Intentional Communities, less elaborately planned but much cheaper to join than the typical eco village.

Mandala was one of a large number of land sharing, multiple occupancy ventures started in Australia during that era when many were dubbed ‘hippy communes’.
Most collapsed within a few years, but Mandala survived its initial period of chaos resulting from inter-personal conflict and poor organisation. After many reforms started in the 1980’s, the company and community are now thriving.

 We live on a 60-acre ranch in Tehachapi, California. We raise livestock and grow our food. We are also looking to grow our membership. So contact Farmer Paul and learn how simple life can be. Come and stay for a visit. Help with the chores, harvest, and refresh yourself. Keep your job in LA and come on the weekends. Or say goodbye to LA and move on in. We would love to hear from you. God Bless.

We are ecofarm between Rome and Naples, in the Abruzzi National Park. It is located in a beautiful area at the foot of the mountain just under two hours from Rome and very well connected with both cities. The farm was abandoned over 40 years ago, and we are slowly bringing it back to life.

It is still rustic, with no electricity, an outside bamboo shack shower, and a compost toilet. The experience is definitely not suitable for everyone. Right now, camping is available. The buildings still need work to make them suitable for living.

We welcome new numbers to our community. If you want to come, please send us a detailed email. Let us know how long you want to stay, your hobbies and interests, travel experience—one of your best experiences and why. 

Also let us know how you think you will contribute to our community.

We are developing our organic garden, but we also need help in many different fields. People are welcome who have skills in carpentry, building, arts of all types, and agriculture, but who also have creativity and imagination. In general, we like active people who have passion and love inside them. 

The farm is very rustic, so if you need comforts you should not come here. You will not be happy. If you are happy with a simple lifestyle and beautiful mountains and nature around you, this could be a good place for   you.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21916&quot;&gt;Elderberry Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To provide a comfortable and affordable home in the country for adults, where we can make independent life choices, pursue activities of interest, follow our spiritual paths, enjoy the benefits of a rural lifestyle (organic gardens, food production, animals) form close and caring relationships, contribute to others, and enjoy life as we age and help one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/elderberry/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/elderberry/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Elderberry is situated on a 10 acre farmstead  in scenic, rural  Rougemont, North Carolina, approximately 30 minutes north of downtown Durham.  Durham, the home of Duke University, provides many cultural and learning experiences.  Durham is also known for its many outstanding  restaurants, arts and festivals.

Elderberry provides a unique model for adults living simply and supporting one another as we grow older, continuing to enjoy the activities we love, with the help and support of close neighbors and friends.  

A cozy community of 18 individually-owned, energy-efficient, universally-designed homes (duplexes and quadraplexes) where members may interact, work on projects, eat and play together, as we choose, and pursue our unique interests and spiritual paths.  A large common house for cooking, group meals, crafts, music, dance, special events,  guests and other activities is situated in the center of the community  surrounded by a courtyard with paths connecting homes.
 
As a rural community would imply, we have created community vegetable gardens and areas for farm animals with the intention of being mindful of protecting the ecological integrity of the land, with the goal of becoming an ecovillage, and as self reliant as possible.

Elderberry is a self-managed, consensus-based community where all members have equal  voice in decisions.  The community was founded by three members of a nearby intentional community and is self developed.</description>

The Community is a 32-unit apartment complex on 5.5 acres and is part of the network of Ananda Communities worldwide. Residency is open to all who are sincere and open to the practice of meditation and yoga in the tradition and teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda (author of &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;). There are approximately 45 adults in residence. There are both Community and individual gardens. Residents grow vegetables, fruit, and flowers; the grounds include a chicken coop, ornamental landscaping, large trees, a swimming pool, a nature trail, and a lawn for gatherings and play. A separate structure serves as a meditation and yoga room for classes and gatherings, banquets, and much more. A Community kitchen is run by residents and provides three vegetarian dinners each week, open to friends and visitors as well as residents. Nearby Ananda Meditation Temple and a teaching center in Seattle offer two locations for classes in meditation and yoga and much more. The first Ananda Community was established in 1968 by Swami Kriyananda, direct disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda, near Nevada City, California, USA.

Residents may rent or own their apartments. Rents are set at local market rates for comparable apartments, plus residents contribute &quot;dues&quot; to support the cost of social and spiritual activities that are above and beyond what is normally provided for by comparable rents. Members of Ananda, whether in the Lynnwood community or elsewhere in the nation, formed an LLC to hold title to the property. An on-site manager and a maintenance person handle day-to-day needs, with the help of participants in periodic community work days and volunteers. The complex is leased to the local Ananda organization for the operation of an intentional spiritual community.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21918&quot;&gt;Open Circle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our community life is based on personal affinity, which means that persons and relationships come first and everything else follows from that. We want to live creatively, and in ways that are fulfilling for all our members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/open-circle/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/open-circle/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Our community is based on personal affinity, which means that persons and relationships come first and everything else follows from that.  We are experimental and we embrace change.  We have been working at this (under various names) for more than 40 years.  We find that the community spirit is powerful and alive and needs to be nurtured every day with caring attention to each other, our feelings, and our needs.  We meet several times a week for this purpose and to coordinate our action. We have seven members, and most of us have years of prior community experience.

Located in central VA, we are within an hour &amp;amp; a half of Twin Oaks, Acorn, Living Energy Farm, Cambia, Mimosa, and Compersia. We have close connections with members of Twin Oaks, Ganas, and Compersia communities and we exchange energies for mutual benefit.

We are lucky to live in a true beauty spot at the base of Old Rag Mountain near Etlan VA.  Our 97 acres of mostly forested land borders on Shenandoah National Park.  We have created (and continue to create) a great physical environment for community living, including a farmhouse, three cabins, and two gardens. We also have a three-story mixed-use building in the nearby town of Culpeper, Virginia, and two of our members live there.

We are a close-knit group and pay a lot of attention to our relationships and our personal growth. We circle together for meals most days, do gardening and projects together, and hold meetings several times a week; this serves us well in staying connected and coordinating our efforts. We wish to grow our community in ways that are sustainable emotionally, financially, and environmentally.  We want to live creatively, and in ways that are fulfilling for all our members. 

We feel that sharing is essential to group living. We make group decisions and go up or down together accordingly. We expect every member to make appropriate contributions of time and money so that we all stay in balance.

Over the next several months, we want to take the time to fully integrate our new and returning members.  We need to reorganize and do some thinking together about new directions. And we want to settle in to who we are now as a community.  For this reason, we want to postpone visitor periods and other steps on the track to membership for new people until the end of 2017 or early 2018.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21919&quot;&gt;Rhiannon Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Another World is Possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/rhiannon-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/rhiannon-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;* Para este información en español, desplácese hacia abajo *

ENGLISH

Location

In 2008, we had a vision of transforming a run-down farmhouse and 15-hectares (38-acres) of over-exploited farmland into a world apart from mainstream culture, where people could grow, heal, live sustainably and regenerate the land while living in community.
Rhiannon sits on the edge of a plateau with 360-degree views; clouds roll over snow-capped volcanoes and the sunsets still take our breath away! The sun can be hot, the wind can be fierce and the nights can be chilly – but with strong motivation, a wood-burning stove and good company, it’s a great way to embrace the elements!

Activities

The activities we offer and engage with are based on our 5 core values:

* Live &amp;amp; Work in Community *

We aim to create an inclusive environment where like-minded people from around the world can build lasting relationships. Families with children and people from minority groups (often LGBT) are all welcome. We are bi-lingual in English and Spanish and come together through work, food, play, relaxation and ceremony.

* Regeneration of Mother Nature *

The properties around Rhiannon is mostly arid, mono-crop farmland and sprawling concrete accommodation. We are revitalising this small corner of the world through reforestation, our organic garden and animal care (donkeys, chickens, bees, worms, dogs and cats). Year-on-year we see the land become greener and more abundant in wildlife.

* Place of Healing *

We all have faced challenge or adversity to some degree in our lives. For our healing we offer yoga, authentic shamanic ceremonies (including plant medicines and temazcal/sweat lodge), heart circles, massage, reiki, journey sessions and other healing practices. We consider ourselves spiritual rather than religious and welcome people from different backgrounds and belief systems.  

* Permaculture Principles * 

We strive to live in harmony with nature with minimal impact. We are a vegan/vegetarian community which focuses on bio-construction, rainwater harvesting and recycling. Our electric and hot water showers are powered by the sun, while our composting toilets help fertilise the trees and waste plastic becomes bottle bricks!

* Personal Growth *

We offer a variety of events and workshops to people within and outside the community to help growth in intellectual, emotional and spiritual ways. Upon request, workshops in massage, energy healing, beekeeping and carpentry are all available. We created a large multi-purpose hall in which to host more external events – from dance, music and yoga to permaculture. Through living and working in community, we also offer people the opportunity to develop their practical skills, foreign languages and inter-personal communication.

Current Projects

Aside from our daily activities, our priority projects for you to get involved in are:

•	Completing adobe construction &amp;amp; lime rendering
•	Upgrading our water harvesting and irrigation systems (including a crowd-funding project)
•	Improving and expanding our existing gardens 
•	Developing events programme
•	Reforestation and tree care

Desired Skills
If you have any of the following skills, we would be particularly interested in hearing from you:
•	Carpentry
•	General maintenance skills
•	Plumbing
•	Event management
•	Group facilitation


Volunteer options

Volunteers are invited to come from anywhere between two weeks, to two months, to two years or more! We ask people to arrive on the 1st or 15th of the month, which enables us to give everyone a thorough tour and creates a group who you can share your journey with! 
All short-term volunteers (up to 3 months) receive: 3 organic meals a day, shared accommodation, living essentials (toilet paper, bedding etc.) and the opportunity to experience community living! Volunteers work 25 hours a week spread over 5 days in the garden or on construction projects (5hrs each morning until lunch) and cook 1 meal per day (or equivalent such as evening watering), which takes approximately 2 hours extra.

Long-term volunteers (3 months +) take on added responsibilities and receive added benefits for their ongoing contribution at Rhiannon, including: a preferred choice of accommodation, flexible working hours and time off for extended holidays.

You can charge your electronics in the main building, however we are without wifi and prefer social interaction over technological consumption. All of our grey water goes back into nature where it is purified by plant and wildlife, therefore please only bring natural products for bathing. These products can be bought in Camari (Santa Clara, Quito). Unfortunately we are unable to accommodate additional animals at this time.

During your stay you will also enjoy two free days per week to go out and enjoy the nearby attractions, or just relax, read and take in the view! Within two hours of Rhiannon you can reach Otavalo and its famous indigenous market, dry-forest camping in Parque Jerusalem, the ancient Cochasqui pyramids, stunning Mojanda and Cuicocha lakes and the Peguche waterfall.

Ubicación 

En 2008, tuvimos una visión de transformar una casa de labranza y 15 hectáreas (38 acres) de tierras de cultivo sobreexplotadas en un mundo aparte de la cultura convencional, donde la gente podría crecer, sanar, vivir sosteniblemente y regenerar la tierra mientras vive en comunidad.

Rhiannon se sienta en el borde de una meseta con vistas de 360 grados; ¡las nubes se enrollan sobre volcanes nevados y los atardeceres todavía nos quitan el aliento! El sol puede ser caliente, el viento puede ser feroz y las noches puede ser frío - pero con una fuerte motivación, una estufa de leña y una buena compañía, ¡es una gran manera de abrazar los elementos!

Actividades 

Las actividades que ofrecemos y nos comprometemos se basan en nuestros 5 valores fundamentales: 

* Vivir y trabajar en la comunidad * 

Nuestro objetivo es crear un entorno inclusivo donde las personas con una mentalidad similar de todo el mundo puedan construir relaciones duraderas. Las familias con niños y personas de grupos minoritarios (a menudo LGBT) son bienvenidas. Somos bilingües en inglés y español y nos reunimos a través del trabajo, la comida, el juego, la relajación y la ceremonia.

* Regeneración de la Madre Tierra * 

Las propiedades en torno a Rhiannon son en su mayoría áridas, tierras de cultivo mono cultivos y el alojamiento de hormigón en expansión. Estamos revitalizando este pequeño rincón del mundo a través de reforestación, nuestro jardín orgánico y cuidado de animales (burros, gallinas, abejas, gusanos, perros y gatos). Año a año vemos que la tierra se vuelve más verde y abundante en la vida silvestre.

* Lugar de sanación * 

Todos hemos enfrentado desafíos o adversidades hasta cierto punto en nuestras vidas. Para nuestra sanación ofrecemos yoga, ceremonias auténticas de shamanic (incluyendo medicinas de plantas y temazcal), círculos de corazón, masajes, Reiki, sesiones de viaje y otras prácticas de sanación. Nos consideramos a nosotros mismos espirituales y no religiosos y damos la bienvenida a personas de diferentes orígenes y sistemas de creencias.

* Principios de Permacultura * 

Nos esforzamos por vivir en armonía con la naturaleza con un impacto mínimo. Somos una comunidad vegana/vegetariana que se centra en la bio-construcción, la recolección de agua de lluvia y el reciclaje. ¡Nuestras duchas eléctricas y de agua caliente son alimentadas por el sol, mientras que nuestros inodoros de compostaje ayudan a fertilizar los árboles y desechos de plástico se convierte en ladrillos de botella!

* Crecimiento personal * 

Ofrecemos una variedad de eventos y talleres a personas dentro y fuera de la comunidad para ayudar a crecer en formas intelectuales, emocionales y espirituales. A petición, se ofrecen talleres de masajes, sanación de energía, apicultura y carpintería. Creamos una gran sala polivalente en la que acoger más eventos externos – desde danza, música y yoga hasta permacultura. A través de la vida y el trabajo en comunidad, también ofrecemos a la gente la oportunidad de desarrollar sus habilidades prácticas, idiomas extranjeros y comunicación interpersonal.

Todos los voluntarios de corto plazo (hasta 3 meses) reciben: 3 comidas orgánicas al día, alojamiento compartido, vitales esenciales (papel higiénico, ropa de cama, etc.) y la oportunidad de experimentar la vida de la comunidad. Los voluntarios trabajan 25 horas a la semana esparcidos durante 5 días en el jardín o en proyectos de construcción (5 cada mañana hasta el almuerzo) y cocinan 1 comida al día (o equivalente como el riego nocturno), que toma aproximadamente 2 horas extra. 

Los voluntarios de largo plazo (3 meses) asumen responsabilidades adicionales y reciben beneficios adicionales por su contribución continua en Rhiannon, incluyendo: una opción preferida de alojamiento, horas de trabajo flexibles y tiempo libre para vacaciones prolongadas.

Tu puedes cargar su electrónica en el edificio principal, sin embargo, estamos sin wifi y prefieren la interacción social sobre el consumo tecnológico. Todo nuestro agua gris se regresa a la naturaleza donde es purificada de las plantas y la vida silvestre, por lo tanto, por favor sólo traer productos naturales para el baño. Estos productos se pueden comprar en Camari (Santa Clara, Quito). Desafortunadamente no podemos acomodar animales adicionales en este momento.

¡Durante su estancia también disfrutarás de dos días libres por semana para salir y disfrutar de las atracciones cercanas, o simplemente relajarse, leer y disfrutar de la vista! Dentro de dos horas de Rhiannon se puede llegar a Otavalo y su famoso mercado indígena, el camping de bosque seco en el parque de Jerusalén, las antiguas pirámides de Cochasqui, impresionantes Mojanda y lagos Cuicocha y la cascada Peguche.

Portland is amazing community, and we are excited to build even better neighborhoods! Portland has year-round farmers markets, a walkable downtown, a great music and arts scene, dozens of participatory sports leagues, and a strong ethic of local food, local business, and healthy living!  
We are re-forming right now, and have people interested in both urban and rural models.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21921&quot;&gt;SongCroft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Sustainability, Permaculture, Farm, Herbalism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/songcroft/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/songcroft/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
&quot;Living in the rhythm of blessed abundance!&quot;

SongCroft is on three acres just outside of the small town of Snohomish, Washington (population 8,500). We are one hour from the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. Half of the land is left to its wild ways with a creek, hemlocks and cedar with plenty of wildlife to observe. Our focus is on permaculture and sustainable living. We have gardens, a greenhouse,orchard, and chickens, ducks, rabbits, goats, bees, dogs, and a cat. 

We would like to share a meal a week, purchase bulk foods together, share in the garden work and harvest as well as other care of the land. We are a farm community and are interested in others who are of an agrarian nature.

Our community is currently full but it looks like we will have an opening soon.  We are currently working on a new dwelling that would be suitable for one to two people. 

We would also love to connect and build community with others in our area. 

If you have an interest in finding out more, please email. 

We are currently merging and revamping our website to see more of what we are up to and into and then give us a call or drop us a line.

We focus on building a more sustainable and just world, and strive to create safer spaces in our cooperative homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/plankton-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/plankton-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Nickel City Housing Cooperative is part of the NASCO Community of Cooperatives. NCHC has two houses: Ol'Wondermoth, founded in 2001, and Plankton House, founded in 2006. Our food is local, CSA bought, or grown ourselves. The houses are full of artists, cyclists, world travelers, couch surfers, animals, and generally pretty cool people. We govern as a house, as a housing co-op, and as a cooperative of cooperatives (NASCO). Both houses strive to be strong members of Buffalo's communities, and host everything from music shows to community meetings, with potlucks happening every week at each house.

Both houses are often looking for new members to drive our vision forward to new cooperative and community endeavors. Come do your thing in Buffalo! It's a low-income town with style and snow to spare! We've got beautiful summers full of water activities, festivals, farmers markets and free concerts! DIY-friendly! Bike-friendly! Vegan-friendly! Pet-friendly! Lots of room to dream!

Dreaming of a world where the things we love about each other makes us better people and helps create something bigger.

WELCOME HOME!

      <name>Blueberry</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21923&quot;&gt;Blueberry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; low-cost urban ecology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/blueberry/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/blueberry/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We have openings!  See our community classified titled
Blueberry is an urban farming collective house within an organic cohousing community in Portland, Oregon. Four sets of friends bought houses on the same block, three in a row and one across the street. We love the unintentional community of our neighborhood, friendly, diverse, and mostly low-income,  with small houses on large lots and a “country” feel. We have work parties, neighborhood potlucks, and parties for the larger community.

Some of us have lived rurally before and maintain as much of the rural life as we can, but an urban life allows us to be less car-dependent, and some of us are completely car-free.

We share passion for our land, our neighborhood, social justice, and sustainability. All of us grow enough vegetables to eat well and still give some away. At Blueberry we heat with wood, generate almost no trash or recycling, eat primarily local, organic whole foods, have no TV, and commute by bicycle. All of us have jobs and lives “off the farm”—we are musicians, teachers, bike mechanics, activists, etc. A few of us embrace spirit and ritual, others choose not to. We value tolerance, diversity, and listening.

Each household has its own internal structure. Blueberry has set a clear intention to transition to cooperative ownership.

As we are an urban community, we are not able to house dogs - they tend to dig up garden beds and scare the ducks.  Guide dogs will be considered.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21925&quot;&gt;Neruda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We come together so that we may better live in accordance with our beliefs, and for the joy of community. We believe that all people have high and equal value, and that respect for all living things has priority over material wealth.

We are committed to living our values personally, in the community and in the outside world. We respect and welcome people of all races, ethnicities, creeds, ages, genders, sexual orientations, abilities, and experiences.

We undertake to create a community in which adults and children can share their lives through work, learning and play and grow with nurturing and support, as a diverse rural community that values ecological sustainability, respect and support for children, integrity, nonviolence, mindfulness, beauty, harmony, healthfulness, simplicity, creativity, joy, honesty, trust and fun. We want to work to grow strong, long-term connections among members and with the outside community, continually seeking to work together, learn together and teach together as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/neruda/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/neruda/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
We are a small community of a few families sharing 200 beautiful acres a half hour from Montpelier. Our ideas, vision, and mission statement are on our website, and we're eager for input from interested people to establish Neruda as an organic process. We hope those interested will work with us to iron out the details.

Neruda is currently home to three households: five adults, four cats, and two dogs. We have room for three more households.
  
We live on beautiful land; about 40 acres are fields and the rest wooded, including a one-acre pond, a stream, and trails. Two households live in a two-family earthship (underground, passive solar, recycled materials) that we are still finishing and one household lives in a newly constructed tiny yurt. Also on the land is an old farmhouse sorely in need of repair. To the southwest and northwest, we are bordered by 25,000 acres of state forest. To our west are 300 acres of village forest. The views from our land are stunning as we’re surrounded by mostly wooded hills and valleys.

We have beautiful land for farming and raising animals. We have the beginning of a fine orchard of apples, pears, plums, blueberries, cherries, and peaches.

We envision working with others to create renewable-energy projects (microhydro, wind, solar), trails open to the public, and other green projects. Marshfield is a town of 1,500 people. The townspeople are environmentally conscious and receptive to environmental projects. The town “center” includes a restaurant, a village store, a gas station and a video rental store. Nearby Plainfield has awesome pizza, another great restaurant, Goddard College and a food coop. There are two other food coops within a half-hour's drive.

Despite our rural surroundings, we have access to four commuter buses in the early morning, one at noontime and another four in the evening, two going to and from St Johnsbury and two going to and from Montpelier. With transfers in Montpelier, we can ride all the way to Burlington in about ninety minutes for as little as two dollars. That's only a half hour longer than it takes to drive by car. Neruda is located about 1.4 miles from the nearest bus stop. The routes and times are posted on the Green Mountain Transit website (http://www.gmtaride.org)

The Living Well Community is a mixed-use community/ecovillage focused on health/wellness, sustainability, service to the greater good,  and honoring  the sacred. 

This is a 124-acre property bordered by a mile of frontage on the Deep River on one side and almost a mile of frontage on Sandy Creek on the other side. 

   The community has a combination of private and shared spaces with additional mixed-uses under development including green businesses, an integrative health center, an organic farm, a community garden, a neighborhood park and orchard, and 53 acres of natural area buffering the creek and river.

   The property is beautiful with mountain-like topography, the river, rock outcroppings, high areas with vistas, the creek, trails, beautiful woods, and abundant wild edible and medicinal plants.   

Our community is located near major highway corridors, just two miles from Highway 64 in the town of Franklinville, North Carolina. This property has regional appeal and access, being only a half-hour from Greensboro, 15 minutes from Asheboro and Siler City, and an hour and 15 minutes from RTP (Research Triangle Park), Raleigh, Durham, and Charlotte. We are centrally located between the mountains and ocean, and at the midpoint on the eastern seaboard between New York and Florida.  We are also approximately a 6 hour drive from Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, Georgia.  



The Conference and Retreat Center, located on the 50-foot-high bluff overlooking Sandy Creek and the Deep River, features the lovely, historic McIver-Faulk House, built in the 1850s and relocated to this site in 2004. The partially completed Conference and Retreat Center will be available for retreats, classes, and events (weddings, reunions, etc.).

Important notice: Earthwise Valley closed in 2010 due to the unexpected passing of one of its founders. This listing is maintained as-is in tribute to the many volunteers who lent their time and energy to the Valley.

Earthwise Valley offers an opportunity for members and visitors to step out of the mainstream world and explore ways of living sustainably, to lighten our ecological footprint—a way for travelers to give something back to Nature, while still experiencing some of the best adventures and sharing life with locals. 

We are located next to the sea where the rainforest meets the deep blue Pacific Ocean.

Our efforts to live more sustainably include permacultural food production, with organic gardens and fruit trees, and ducks and geese; experiments with earth building techniques; timber plantations; and renewable energy—micro-hydro generation and solar panels.

High Cove is a community in the mountains of western North Carolina, focused on the environment, the arts and sciences, and lifelong learning. We are creating a sustainable community that fosters rich and lasting human relationships and provides a place for people of all ages and backgrounds to live, learn, and share experience––while preserving the land, water, and native plants and animals. High Cove includes a forest preserve, organic farm site, and trails along creeks and ridge tops. There are two neighborhoods, and a mixed-use village center is planned. High Cove is located less than an hour from downtown Asheville, near the renowned Penland School of Crafts, in an area alive with potters, woodworkers, and other crafts workers.
Building sites for homes and studios are available. Development standards call for green homes that conserve energy and natural resources. Sites allow for passive solar, and renewable energy is encouraged. Small (and tiny) houses are welcome. Rental housing is available, but goes quickly.
A small, mixed-use village center is planned. This “main street” is called Castanea Street in honor of the magnificent tree that was decimated by blight. By planting chestnut trees, we will help bring the chestnut back to this region. Land is also set aside for an organic farm, and community garden plots for residents. 
In addition to caring for the natural environment, High Cove supports the human environment with a variety of public and civic spaces. These gathering places are the foundation of neighboring, and build the social capital that makes great communities. We seek diversity in age, income, and background. LGBTQ welcome.
We would welcome the opportunity to partner with folks who are interested in  creating co-housing at High Cove.

Alderleaf Wilderness College is a nature, sustainability, and wilderness survival school. 

Alderleaf Wilderness College's land is a developing permaculture farm nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. It is located above the Skykomish River valley near the town of Monroe, Washington, 30 miles northeast of Seattle. Our 15-acre property is an evolving model of environmental sustainability. Alderleaf Wilderness College has its office and classrooms on site and several staff, interns, and student live on site.

The large forested portion of the land contains giant mossy cedars, a cascading creek, a diversity of wildlife, and several wetlands. It is adjacent to thousands of acres of forest lands with many lakes, streams, and mountains.

The land is in the process of integrating a permaculture design plan. The farm includes cabins, houses, a large barn, beautiful pastures, garden space, and fruit trees.

A limited number of rooms for rent are available to staff, interns, and students in our Wilderness Certification Program and occasionally others interested in being involved with Alderleaf. Residents share a passion for nature, sustainability, and community, and often enjoy the opportunity to grow organic food and steward the land.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21932&quot;&gt;Bellbunya Community Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are exploring living in ways that are spiritually, socially, environmentally and economically sustaining, whilst sharing and engaging with the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bellbunya-community-association/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bellbunya-community-association/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
We are individuals united in seeking to create conscious community that are havens liberating and nurturing the potential of all through social equity, integrity, courage, transformative growth, collaborative enterprises, and celebration and care of the planet.

In December 2008 we created a four-bottom-line intentional community / ecovillage on the Sunshine Coast hinterland at Belli Park, near Noosa, to model sustainable community living.  

The first bottom line is personal transformative growth and the recognition of the connection that exists in all of us and our planet.  The community thus has a spiritual, though non-denominational, basis.  Our intention is fundamentally outward focused, with the intent to interact and contribute to society in positive ways.

The second is social sustainability and connection.  This incorporates facilitating people from different ages, backgrounds and economic circumstances, setting a  community size of 12 or more.  It incorporates governance that is honouring to all, recognising the need to be heard; and communication and conflict resolution skills. We have clear processes in place to give transparency.

The third is economic sustainability, which incorporates the community's stability as well as desirable industry that supports individual economic sustainability. We also seek the growth of non-currency based internal economies.

The fourth is environmental sustainability, which incorporates  food production on our rural site; rainwater harvesting, treatment, and dispersal;  building design, construction, and refurbishments; and renewable energy. Overarching this is respect and care of the natural country of which we are the current stewards.

Our 16 hectare (40 acre) property has conference/workshop facilities including a hall, restaurant, and suites of accommodations for small groups. We welcome enquiries for holding workshops and retreats that further our sustainable and ethical practices.

We are also open to additional community members at this stage. There may be building sites and rental spaces for like-minded people who share our vision and have the energy and enthusiasm to see this project through.
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21933&quot;&gt;Schloss-Glarisegg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To form a new culture of encounter, consciousness and personal growth.
Authenticity. Connection. Creational Power. Transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/schloss-glarisegg/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/schloss-glarisegg/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Glarisegg Castle – “A place for encounter and consciousness” – lies between forests, a wild river, fields and Lake Constance. The community lives on a gorgeous property with large natural areas and a private beach. We are connected by a shared interest in personal responsibility and the questions of our time, and we would like to contribute to the research on new ways of living. We value synergy between personal needs and input towards a shared vision. So we set ourselves the daily challenge of finding a balance between work on communal projects and the celebration of our shared life: via communal singing and music making, regular meetings in mandatory groups and intensive periods that last several days. Our tools are, amongst others, Community Building (Scott Peck style), forums (ZEGG style), transparent communication and possibility management. In 2010 we invited new people, particularly families, for a “joining period”, so we are now in the middle of a “second set-up phase”. There is more scope for new members, too. A permaculture project with a central vegetable garden has been developing since 2012. There is a forest group for younger children. Part of the communal project is the seminar business, a small shop, as well as the creativity and instrument workshop. We are open-minded people, who see communal life as a possibility to grow together and bring a new culture into existence.</description>

A place for all the ones who will learn about the new Celtic view and put in practice the harmonious integration of landscape and people--providing their food, energy, shelter, and other material and non-material needs in a sustainable way.   After the fire storm of October 2017 lot is changed and we need still help and support. More by mail.

East Blair Housing Co-op was established in 1982 in the Whiteaker neighborhood of Eugene Oregon. Currently we have 22 units for occupancy with a community room, communal gardens, sauna, and individual patios and garden spaces. We participate in neighborhood events such as the Last Friday Art Walk, where we may host a Kid's Art event in our kid-oriented play area. We govern by modified consensus; each member is expected to devote a certain number of hours to helping EBHC. Our current members range in age from 1 ½--84 years old. New members are accepted by application; confirmation of references, and intensive interviews as vacancy allows.

We are a residential group of hermits or solitaries (and others in religious communities or domestic monasteries) living together (or alone) for the mutual benefit and protection of the whole. We have communities in MANY countries.

http://sites.google.com/site/trinityprioryinternational/

Each person is respected for the level of solitude he or she desires and great efforts are taken by all to ensure that the sanctity of that solitude is never broken under any circumstances. Members live in individual residences at the hermitage.

This is the international residential centre; we have other small residential communities in other countries. We also have training by correspondence - novitiate training for monastics, in community or in their own homes. 

We are interdenominational and for pastoral purposes us different rites e.g. Orthodox Liturgy, Western Rites, etc. We also offer silent worship or meditation.

Like all contemplatives from all religions (or none, as is the case with humanists or secularists), we focus on the present NOW moment. This practice existed for thousands of years, (long before Eckart Tolle and Oprah sensationalized it with their 500,000 members “studying” this subject on internet). Contemplatives from all faiths (like Eastern Orthodox Christians, western Christian contemplatives, centering prayer, Zen, Vedanta's self-realization, etc.) all emphasize the moment when one breathes, as the moment when alone one exists, is alive, conscious, living.

      <name>Hart's Mill Ecovillage</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21938&quot;&gt;Hart's Mill Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are an agrarian intentional community: restorative in our agriculture, sustainable in our designs and practices, collaborative in our social and work life, and celebratory and creative in all that we do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/harts-mill/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/harts-mill/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;

Hart’s Mill Ecovillage is an evolving community planned for a beautiful 112-acre expanse of fields, streams and woods located 10 miles west of Hillsborough in Orange County, NC.  Our vision is to provide a tangible example of integrated ecologically, socially and economically sustainable ways of living for residents plus entrepreneurial partners and visitors.  We also intend for it to be a model and educational resource for others who wish to forge similar endeavors.
We seek to create a compact village-style rural housing cooperative with 30 homes.  Our goal is to establish a high quality of life while minimizing resource use and preserving the majority of the land in agriculture, woodlands, and open space.  The initiative is being led by a group of local residents who intend to live at Hart’s Mill.  Hart’s Mill has been founded with the intention of modeling integrated, low-impact approaches to residential development and land stewardship. Elements of this goal include:
	adoption of the best site and building design principles and practices for reducing use of energy, water, and other resources
	management of the land for diversified food and timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation, research and education
	opportunities for aging in place within a vibrant multi-generational community
	accessibility to flexible, affordable housing options
	onsite opportunities for farm and home-based employment
	a high degree of self-sufficiency in food, fiber, and energy
The size of our village allows us to know each other deeply, while nourishing social relationships, food production, employment opportunities, and shared facilities to meet many of our needs on-site.  Our governance is sociocracy, and we welcome new members who would like to participate in making Hart’s Mill a reality.
We achieved re-zoning in November, 2015, and we plan to break ground in 2017.

The Flying Fish Organic Village is already built.  we have 5 cottages, a grand bure and yoga centre/meeting hall.   We grow fresh, organic food and build traditional buildings from all natural materials collected on the island…fully eco-friendly and beautiful

This quiet paradise is powered by the sun’s radiance and human power, where there are no roads and most certainly no cars. We have ample rainwater storage (10,000 litres, a huge organic plantation, boats, and a community dining room with excellent local chefs.  Small cottages (Fijian bures) and large tents shelter locals and visitors comfortably.

Please visit for a few weeks or a few months stay, as a voluntourist.
After a one month trial period you may be invited to enjoy three months and with approval you may be invited to stay up to one year.  You can also be an annual visitor, supporter or long-term voluntourist.  Currently we aren't welcoming new members or visitors due to structural changes in the community

Imagine a pristine beach of golden sands. A place where music and singing are shared joyfully. Fijians value family, peace and cooperative sharing and welcome you like family!

Organic agriculture, natural building, and sustainable energy empower the villagers to share their enduring lifestyle. Operated by native Fijians and extended family, now joined by sustainability educators and other non-Fijians. Currently we are not welcoming additional visitors or members. This cross-cultural alliance supports traditional Fijian culture while teaching sustainability in an organic setting, creating a model and protecting the natural environment, by creating a sustainable economy for the friendly Fijians.  This works.

Native music and ceremony create a deeper cross-cultural experience.

Visitors relax in peace 

Assist in gardens, daily life or on a community project. Learn valuable skills and traditional life-ways with a very, very low carbon footprint.

To sustain this reality and vision, these friendly Fijians welcome your needed support rather than overly impacting the natural world. In this fragile ecosystem we can help sustain this pristine tropical wonderland.
Financial assistance and donations are deeply appreciated.

Imagine a place where children are safe…a place to swim amongst coral reefs of amazing diversity. Imagine a place that sustains us spiritually. All who join us in this island paradise are touched by the local's gentle ways, by the beauty and peace.

Bula Vinaka!

      <name>The Village on Sewanee Creek</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21943&quot;&gt;The Village on Sewanee Creek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Self-sufficient, Free, Living the Love of Christ through Service

OUR MISSION is to be a self-sustaining community
in harmony with nature and people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-village-on-sewanee-creek/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-village-on-sewanee-creek/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Sustainability at The Village on Sewanee Creek is at the intersection of creativity, personal liberty &amp;amp; accountability, love of nature and mutual caring. Private property ownership is valued as a key to accountable stewardship.  We believe that people with the right values require little in the way of intrusive oversight. We tend to be conservative or libertarian in outlook, but welcome diversity of thought, background and skills.
We seek people with diverse skills and backgrounds for self-sufficient community life in an old-fashioned neighborhood with strong Christian values.

Located on the beautiful Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee, the property abounds with waterfalls, hemlock &amp;amp; harwdood forests, clear bluff views of the Sewanee gorge and wooded mountains.  Recognized as one of the most bio-diverse areas in the US.

Why Tennessee?
• no income taxes, 
• low property taxes, 
• low cost of living,
• lush woodlands and rocky bluffs overlooking canyons and streams,
• a diverse culture, from “mountain folks” (who know how to live simply) to academia. (Nearby, Historical U. of the South -rich cultural heritage).

Villagers have diverse experience and enjoy working together and teaching each other how to be self-sufficient in:

Water: Rainwater collection systems encouraged.  Such systems make us completely independent of municipal water although city water is also available.

Food: (A community garden is maintained with help from an organic gardening coach.)  Lots are large enough to be food self-sufficient.  Some raise chickens, cows, goats or other livestock and we all share or barter.

Energy: Solar PV, Wood gasification, micro-hydroelectric, other forms of sustainable energy practiced.

Healthy living:  Use of local herbs, healthy diet.

Community: 50 of the 207 acres are a nature preserve. Hiking trails wander pristine woodlands past waterfalls to the secluded Sewanee Creek. A common area features breathtaking canyon and mountain views. Outdoor pavilions with barbecue pits welcome picnics.  A natural rock amphitheater surrounds a stage and large screen where family movies are shown against the backdrop of a dark, starlit sky.   

Located between Chattanooga and Nashville in a rural setting, with shopping, restaurants, etc., an easy 5 to 25 minutes away.

Perfect for a primary residence in a prepared community or a second-home safe haven. Home sites feature stunning bluff views, creeks, and magnificent waterfalls.

      <name>Willow Springs</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21945&quot;&gt;Willow Springs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Willow Springs provides an essential creative hub for the San Juan Ridge community and the greater Yuba watershed. We provide nourishing spaces for living, creating, and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/willow-springs/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/willow-springs/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We’ve been called many things from being a “commune” (we’re not) to a “mystery ranch” (we like that one).  In simplest terms, Willow Springs is a community hub supporting free expression and cultivating the creative seed lying within.

On any given day, you may witness the following: cabinets being made from sustainably harvested bamboo; hand-sculpted pottery and blown glass being created; yoga classes taught out of a re-purposed auto garage; vegetables, berries, and flowers being organically farmed; and designers developing their next visions to be manifested for the community.

However, it is not really the “what” that makes Willow Springs.  Rather, it’s the common belief in what’s possible when we honor each other’s passion and the earth that supports all of us.  We invite you to inquire about how you can participate in this ongoing, ever-evolving community project.

Evolving since 2001, we have just begun to scratch the surface of this land’s potential to be a place for people to collaborate and manifest their dreams, visions, and intentions. We’re currently experiencing a process to reform the community into one that is owner-based instead of rental-based.

*The Place*
On an old 3-1/2 acre homestead that once sustained a roadhouse bar and auto garage, we have found a modest place to test our audacious vision. Fronting State Highway 49 (linking together the gold strike towns of 1849) as you enter North San Juan (population 250), the land follows what is thought to be an old filled in creek bed that now saturates the gently sloping meadows during the winter rainy season. Scattered throughout the grassland are houses, barns, shops, and various outbuildings.

With this fabric of old buildings and fertile land as a starting point, we have methodically and intuitively begun to weave in our vision. At the moment, we are sustaining affordable housing, a half-acre organic farm with a community supported agriculture program, woodworking and metal shops, a yoga studio, architecture and sculpture studios, and community dining and event space.

As we restore and regenerate this place, we strive as much as possible to use locally sourced and reused building materials, renewable energy, water pumped and cycled on site, and permaculture gardening practices. We see our desire to heal and strengthen the mind, body, and spirit as necessarily intertwined with these practices and a consciousness of place.

*The People*
There is a saying that the essence of farming is first and foremost to grow the soil. At Willow Springs, we aspire to cultivate a place where people are nourished and inspired to unlock the potential of their dreams. We believe that within every person lies a unique combination of passion and innate ability capable of sustaining his or her life energy. In providing an environment full of love and evolving natural beauty, we seek to be catalysts in each other’s growth.

We are collectively pursuing many passions from design to farming to artisanal crafts. We are an evolving group consciously creating a place that diverges from the norm, yet stays connected. We believe in salvaging and tinkering; gardening and sharing meals; seeking inspiration for innovation from nature while cherishing its perfection; quietly meditating and raucously jamming.

We are interested in practicing our principles and learning by doing. We embrace the adventure as we experiment with sustainable living. Along the way, we hope to share some of what we learn.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21947&quot;&gt;Trillium Creek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We desire to live in a friendly and connected multi-generational neighborhood, sharing resources, protecting the natural environment around us, and inspiring each other to make contributions to our community and world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/trillium-creek/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/trillium-creek/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Trillium Creek will be a multi-generational green community located on a meadow amid 24 acres of redwoods and creeks on the north coast of California in Arcata. Our vision is to find neighbors who will love community, synergize in creative ways, and enjoy sharing stewardship of this incredibly beautiful place. Homes will be located on 3 of 24 acres very close to Humboldt State University and the Arcata Community Forest. The climate is mild. Forest, creeks and wildlife surround us, and we can walk or bike to town. Humboldt State University and CenterArts are just a bit more than a half-mile away! There will be only 8 lots, but 6 of them can accommodate 2 homes. 17 of the redwood-forested acres, including the 2 creeks, will be in permanent natural reserve. There are acres of private space to walk, refresh, and be with nature. This new neighborhood is being designed to include:

* Sustainable and energy-efficient green building strategies
* Healthy and stable community connections that promote wellbeing
* Multi-generational living with friendliness toward children, families, elders and pedestrians
* Alternative Transportation: Walkable and bikeable to HSU, the Arcata Plaza and a local bus stop
* Shared common hall and gardens
* Lifelong learning
* Global thriving
* Affordability

We're excited!  We anticipate lots complete with roads, driveways, underground electricity, and city utilities this fall!

Cold    Pond  Community  Land Trust is an intentional community comprised of  residents, board members and volunteers who work and/or live on the land trust. We believe in our efforts to protect our surrounding forest and farm land, watersheds, wildlife habitat and open spaces by exploring  sustainability and living lives of minimal impact. Our board and residents collectively steward 215 acres of common lands. Beyond the agricultural and conservation means, the land is open to the public for hiking, cross-country skiing, horseback riding and various other purposes.

Regional Overview

The Cold Pond Community Land Trust is located in the town of Acworth, in southwest New Hampshire, 9 miles east of the Connecticut River. Acworth has a population of over 900 people spread out over nearly 40 square miles. The town is located 45 minutes north of the city of Keene, New Hampshire.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21949&quot;&gt;Freethinkers Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are striving for a good, sustainable, healthy community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/freethinkers-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/freethinkers-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are a family north of the Marinette, Wisconsin area who are interested in finding other couples, individuals, or families who would like to live more sustainably. Our main goals include large-scale personal and market gardens, long-term food storage, small-scale keeping of livestock, energy independence, and learning how to function without depending on outside assistance through the inevitable ups and downs of life. 

We have 27 acres of rolling land near the Menominee River that we are currently developing into a small homestead. There is a fair amount of affordable land for sale in the area for anyone interested in forming a community with us but not in the sharing of property. As a matter of fact, there are 80 acres to the direct south of our land for sale - already developed a bit. We might even sell off some of our own acreage to the right people.

We believe in the importance of community and families. We would love to have other people to share this journey with. Not only would we enrich each other’s lives, but as the old saying goes: two hands are better than one. We are helpful to a fault and willing to learn just about anything we have to. If you are interested in joining us on this venture, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We are going in this direction whether or not we can put together a group… we just think it would be a lot more fun and interesting to make this happen with a community.

Our goals with our land do not currently include selling off small parcels or incorporating. We have plans to build guest housing or small rentals on our land for those who are interested in the lifestyle and for one reason or another can't afford to buy in the area. These will not be finished for a few years, however.

Please remember that this lifestyle is not something you can simply jump into on a whim. It's a lot of hard work and the initial start up cost for land, housing, and equipment is fairly steep. I don't mean to scare anyone away from this, because in my opinion it's totally worth every penny and every drop of sweat. I'm merely implying that we are looking for serious, dedicated people who have thoroughly thought this lifestyle through. Is that you? Are you done dreaming and ready to get your hands dirty? If so, please contact us!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21950&quot;&gt;New Natives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Build a sustainable egalitarian culture based on sincerity, respect and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/new-natives/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/new-natives/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are two polyamorous adults with two children, seeking for more life partners in order to form a commune or tribe and build together a new culture, able to fulfill in a sustainable way not just our basic needs but also our legitimate aspirations for emotional and physical closeness, a healthy sexuality, connection with Nature, knowledge and research, cultural and artistic expression, etc. 

We foster warm and egalitarian relationships, sincere and empathetic communication, tolerance and humbleness. We consider this essential in order to live together in a fair and enriching way, making a very close cooperation of more people possible, thus allowing a higher level of economical and ecological sustainability, and ideally both an expansion of our new culture and a positive influence on the society at large.

We seek a balance between traditional knowledge and experimentation, intuition and reason, recreational and practical activities, as aspects of a holistic life. We envision the whole tribe rather than just parents as responsible for the care and education of children, respecting their development process, diversity, freedom and creativity.

For us, a holistic conception of health includes freedom from drug abuse (both illegal and legal), and caring for our physical and mental well-being preferably by natural non-aggressive means, acknowledging disturbing symptoms as conveying a message rather than just trying to suppress them. We also avoid radiations such as those from microwave ovens and wireless devices, some of us are sensitive to them.

We strive to reduce our ecological footprint by having a simpler lifestyle. We grow part of our food and seek to become more self-sufficient and use a higher proportion of renewable energy sources. Being more people would make this easier. 

We are conscious about the effects of our diet choices on our health, the environment and animal welfare. We follow a vegetarian diet, but we might be open to include a small proportion of meat in case we develop an efficient permacultural design that produces it. We aim to move closer to a 100% organic diet. 

We share our income, and we are trying to figure out ways of deriving it from ethical and meaningful activities, avoiding if possible to resort to external jobs. We run a small organic food importing business, but it's not really profitable yet. One of us owns the house we live in and the land we cultivate, we acknowledge that this is not optimal from an egalitarian point of view and we are open to discuss ways of overcoming this problem.

We live in Skattungbyn, a beautiful village that has a large proportion of alternative-minded people. While our main objective is to grow as a close-knit group, we are open to join or help build a larger, looser intentional community or ecovillage, either here or elsewhere, although it's not so easy for us to move, at least for the next few years.</description>

The complex is situated in the heart of Boulder and is bordered by the beautiful Boulder Creek multi-use path, Scott Carpenter Park, the campuses of the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) and Naropa University, and the 29th Street Mall. Our lofts, flats and townhouses are surrounded by mature trees and plenty of green space.
Our community consists of members with a diversity of backgrounds, careers, ages and views. We all share a desire to live in a conscious community that honors a heart-felt way of being together. We are a service-focused community that values creativity, having fun together, personal growth, conscious communication, participation, contributing to the broader community and the environment, and sharing resources with one another</description>

We are an urban cohousing ecovillage cultivating supportive relationships with each other, the larger community, and the Earth. 

We are a &quot;green&quot; 37-residence condominium development and cohousing community composed of private condos with full kitchens supplemented by extensive common facilities. The village is on 3.73 acres that include play areas, vineyards, extensive vegetable gardens, and mature fruit and nut trees. Our common spaces include a 1912 6-bedroom farmhouse, Dining Hall, storage building, crafts room, and laundry room. We are located on two frequent-service bus lines in inner northeast Portland.

Members of the community share a growing concern for the environment and a desire to live lightly upon the earth, while strengthening social ties that are lost in the rushed and hectic pace of life today. Our residents range in age from two to 89 years old.

Many people contact us to inquire about internships, volunteer opportunities, or overnight stays. At this time, we do not have a volunteer program. We are only able to host personal guests of current residents, or people who are actively in the process of renting or buying an available unit. If you are interested in exploring Columbia Ecovillage as a potential new home, please join our email list, which alerts subscribers about available homes as they arise. We have scheduled tours on the first Saturday of the month. Please consult our website for the tour schedule and email list signup.

If you are a student or journalist wishing to conduct research about cohousing or ecovillages, please consult our website, which is chock full of interesting and helpful information about our community, and co-housing in general. If you have additional questions, please contact us by email with your questions, and someone from our Outreach Team may be able to accommodate with a brief interview.

Thanks for your interest!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21953&quot;&gt;Adawehi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To discover and share health for oneself and the planet by addressing whichever area of health—body, mind, spirit, or emotions—that you need to strengthen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/adawehi/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/adawehi/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The 125-acre Adawehi campus is the home of around 50 people. It is a community of individuals who are raising their consciousness by releasing patterns that keep them from acting, thinking, and/or feeling the vibrancy of health. While each individual will have their particular focus, support of health is always the theme in all ten community houses. New homes are under construction to give more people an opportunity to join. 

The population of the community is a multi-racial mix of old and young, singles, couples, and families. While everyone is expected to contribute in maintaining the Adawehi buildings, grounds, and activities, jobs must be secured away from the land. The diversity of our community family has brought together a beautiful cornucopia of heart-gifts and talents. To check if we are a good fit, our Adawehi Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast offers two gorgeous rooms available for nightly/weekly rent. 

Adawehi has a multitude of offerings to support you in gaining your personal goals of health such as: personal growth classes, yoga, community events, Beneficial Foods organic grocery, workout equipment, walking trails, ten wellness practitioners, plus a vast collection of supportive CD’s by the founder, Jackie Woods. 

We believe that everyone is entitled to live life in a passionate and creative way. However, to reach this state, you need to be healthy in body, mind, spirit, and emotions. It is this principle on which the Adawehi community was founded. And by living it, that the community has stayed healthy for seventeen years. The vibrancy of health should be a carrier of your spirit’s love into all areas of your expression. We welcome you to join us on our journey. For when people have the support to heal on all levels of their being, their hearts touch other hearts and the world is changed.

EcoJoya is about creating a new paradigm in living—a new paradigm in which people live in community with each other and with their local ecosystems. Mutual honor and respect for one another as well as for the health of the environment are paramount. Living sustainably and working with nature using permaculture and similar guiding principles preserve a joyful happy lifestyle.

EcoJoya is about empowering people and communities to live sustainably, using local resources. 

Our first project is in the cool mountains of Costa Rica where we have 50 acres of pasture, forest, views, springs, creeks, and over five beautiful waterfalls. The temperature varies from 63 F to 78 F all year around.  We have a rainy and dry season. 

All visitors and lengths of stay are welcome, if we have room. Whether you're working for food or just want to enjoy walking to our 80-foot waterfall, we can accommodate you.  Short term visitors pay to stay but we are always make deals with long term volunteers, workers and potential community members that can pull their own weight and contribute.

We are currently seeking people experienced in all aspects of permaculture, farming, and, animal husbandry, construction, homesteading skills, natural building  and video production.

Ideally, we are seeking 4 to 5 small young families like ourselves to share our farm with.  Working together to help with our cottage businesses and educate our children together in a home schooling environment.  Lots of money is not required or at all in some cases.  We are more interested in skills and productive people.

We can sleep between 10 and 15 people in our current community house, with an additional structure and spaces being built. We are and will be experimenting with various natural and alternative structures, including earth-bag, bamboo, geodesic, bermed, cobb, and various prefab options etc. 

We're 10 miles from the nearest large city but isolated enough for peace and comfort. We're about 45 minutes from the Pacific beaches as well.  

We have high-speed internet through wireless links on the farm. So we can have the best of eco-living and high-tech tools for research and communications.

We would like to  be starting various workshops that revolve around both permaculture and sustainable farming and technologies. Sustainable aquaponics is a high priority on our list.

We plan to create lots of video How-To’s and to document every part of our journey. We will ultimately want to evolve into both a prototype and a school that we can duplicate again and again as we expand to other locations around the country and the world.

We are always open to new ideas and better ways of doing things.

There is so much to say.  Our website is not always up but you can try it.
Or contact us here though this listing.

We also have rooms for rent through Airbnb under the title Sustainable Farmhouse in CostaRica

Belfast is a city of 7,000 people located in midcoast Maine between Camden and Bar Harbor. The city features an active waterfront and lively arts community, and is the center of business, services, and government for the surrounding county. Traditional housing in the Belfast area falls into two main categories: in-town residential neighborhoods and rural, large-lot homesteads. Belfast Cohousing &amp;amp; Ecovillage is a community that combines the best elements of both types: located in a rural area with clustered housing and shared infrastructure, but working to preserve neighboring open land for wildlife, recreation, and farming, while fostering a close-knit, cooperative, and intentionally ecological way of life.

We are a group of roughly 70 people from many walks of life. We are business owners, educators, naturalists, gardeners, builders, farmers, doctors, writers, musicians, IT professionals, and children of all ages. Our 42-acre community is located just two miles from Belfast's downtown and harbor. We are within 1.5 miles of elementary and middle schools, Cornerspring Montessori Elementary School, the University of Maine Hutchinson Center, a YMCA, grocery and other retail stores.

All of our homes are highly energy efficient, with triple-pane windows and doors and oriented towards the sun. Two-thirds of the homes have solar systems, making them near net-zero for energy consumption. Personal garden plots are available, and we have a community orchard. We also have a 3-acre worker share CSA farm on our property, where neighbors gather each week to harvest veggies and maintain the land. 

Our 4,000 sq ft common house is complete, with a living room, dining room, playroom, guest rooms, and root cellar. We share a couple home-cooked meals weekly, as well as educational, environmental, and social events.

We currently have the following units available for sale:
-a 500 square foot, 1-bedroom unit near the common house

Please visit our website for more information on visiting us or to learn more about the available homes.

      <name>Catholic Ecovillage</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21957&quot;&gt;Catholic Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Catholic Community, Ecology, Mission Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/catholic-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/catholic-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Catholic Ecovillage is to be a collage of ideas forming one community.  Our vision is to bring us closer to God and our vocations, as they come forth in our individual lives.  We hope to achieve these ideas through three main ideas.
  First and foremost, is to give glory to God, through daily prayer and continual studies of the scripture. Our hope is to do this individually as well as a community.  We believe prayer and studies will draw us closer as a community.
Second, that we as a community spread our message of love.  It is important that everyone make an effort to do community work inside an outside the immediate village.  Our vision is to place Catholic Ecovillage within an area of people less fortunate.  An idea that comes to mind is in a rural area of Eastern Kentucky other Appalachian region.  Eastern Kentucky or Southern parts of Ohio are areas of interest.  Mission work could range from a number of ideas.  We envision becoming a support for other programs within these areas.  General Education(tutoring programs), Home Rehab, and Ecological or Conservation Awareness are several ideas that come to mind.  The beauty is that mission work can be anything. Many wonderful ideas of assisting others have been brought forth.  Really anything that spreads the love of Christ through action is a possibility.
Catholic Ecovillage's third idea and initial goal is to create a community.  Our eventual hope is to create a village that is environmentally and conservation-minded. We hope to create a sustainable, renewable permaculture within the space we call home.  Our goal are to find and use alternative energy, alternative building techniques, along with gardening and livestock care. Our goal is to also create a school building and place of worship within the village. We would also like to stay in close proximity to a town, and college or university. Higher Education certainly will be important.  
Our hope is to eventually have little shops, stores &amp; B&amp;B. A retreat center is another distinct possibility. These could assist with spreading our missions and ideas.


Part of the teaching of Catholicism is to strive to be more Christ like.  What better way to do this than to surround yourself with others trying to do the same? All vocations of life, single, married, families and active seniors who have something to add. Please feel free to drop and email. Begin the change in your life, through Christ and community.

The ‘Beyond’ Community gracefully appreciates how privileged we are to have a piece of paradise and share a desire to live in peace and harmony with Mother Earth and Father Sky.
Our small community is located on a beautiful 200 acre property in the hills above Cairns and the Coral Sea, in tropical North Queensland (North-Eastern Australia).  We are surrounded on three sides by rainforest wilderness with hundreds of waterfalls which we access, and magnificent views of the picturesque Atherton Tableland and Queensland’s highest mountains. 
Our community is forming and looking for people with energy, ideas and resources that would like to help build and share the benefits of living in an intentional community in one of the most beautiful and abundant places in our planet. 
The key objectives at present are to build ever more sustainable and joyful lifestyles, by increasing our self-sufficiency and sharing mutual goals that empower us individually and collectively.
We have experimented with community over the past decade and are keen to keep evolving the processes we have found to be most beneficial in coordinating and harmonising our activities and aspirations.
The ‘Beyond’ Community seeks to build strength and resilience through diversity, with an emphasis on mutual respect, collaboration, and self-realisation.  
We have established large organic gardens, orchards and native forests.
It is possible to visit us as a ‘helper’ or ‘guest’ should you wish to see your haven for yourself.
People seeking to join or know more about the ‘Beyond’ Community can email bood@tpg.com.au</description>

      <name>Safe Haven Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21960&quot;&gt;Safe Haven Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our focus is sustainability, educational outreach, natural healing, individual responsibility, emergency preparedness, and renewable energy, earth-friendly, family-friendly environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/safe-haven/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/safe-haven/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Safe Haven is a part time intentional community nestled in a valley in Central Utah near Spring City. We spend weekends in the spring, summer and fall developing our village until we have structures built that are comfortable during the winter. Although if someone wanted to live there in a camp trailer they could. We are experimenting with small 200 sqft  structures made of cob and earth bags while preparing to get permits and funding for larger structures such as a community center and homes. We are setting up and education system so people can receive a sustainable living certificate. 

Community members enjoy the following benefits:

Residence- Those who would like to live full time at Safe Haven Village may either build homes, stay in a camp trailer, hurt, etc. and/or be stewards of the future community  center. 

Retreat/Vacation Home- Those who want a place in the country to visit and relax on the weekends may enjoy living at Safe Haven part time.

Emergency - One of our purposes is to ensure a safe place to go in times of upheaval. Members can stock  emergency supplies, food and water. 
				
Healing Center-  Currently we have retreats where people camp and allow the land to heal them, go on vision quests and enjoy a sweat lodge. Eventually, the community center will host healing seminars and ongoing workshops to teach and facilitate physical, emotional and spiritual healing.                                                  

Food- We will primarily focus on perma culture and create a food forest. There will be an outdoor community garden during the growing season and green house during the winter.

OUR VALUES:

Family Friendly – Our community is conducive to raising children who are responsible, nurtured, mentally curious, and creative. The adults strive to model healthy behavior.

Personal Sovereignty - We support the principles of freedom. We take personal responsibility for our actions and our needs.

Work Ethic - We all work minimal community hours while valuing free time and the pursuit of personal empowerment.

Spirituality -We have no set religion or spiritual belief. Most have a Judeo-Christian background and a lot of us enjoy Native American or Eastern spiritual practices.

Sustainability - Our building practices, water usage, food production, and energy production aspire to a seven generation model. Our goal is a zero impact lifestyle.

Alternative Buildings – Buildings are various debt-free and earth friendly types that minimize the use of manufactured products: earthships, domes, rammed earth, cob, etc.

Leadership - We strive for consensus, but accept decisions with an 80% majority if consensus cannot be reached.

Relationships – Our community consists of families, couples and singles in a wholesome atmosphere. We value exclusive committed relationships.

Limitations - Our community is free of all illegal activities including drugs. We have no public drunkenness, public nudity, freeloaders, vulgarity, visible junk, and abusive behavior. Smoking is allowed only in designated areas or personal homes so that the smoke does not impact others in the community.

Conflict Resolution - We commit to constructively and peacefully working out our differences.

Structures-      Off the grid and naturally built. The Earthbag, cob, straw bale, etc.</description>

Vision: We’re forming a sustainable community with Songaia Cohousing, creating a new kind of welcoming neighborhood committed to lifelong care for the Earth and each other.

You are invited to learn about our progress in building community on land adjoining Songaia Cohousing. Our vision is to encircle Songaia with neighbors who value community life and our lovely land, and who want to create new possibilities.

About Songaia: Songaia Cohousing is a strong, established community of 38 people in 13 homes on 10.6 acres. Songaia completed its 10-year, self-developed project in 2000—we live in modest homes with abundant land and common facilities near Seattle. Songaia is multi-generational, ages 3 to 72, with only two resales since 2000, one to a New Earth Song member.

Project: Our vision, values, mission, and scope are coming into focus due to our work and that of our consultants. We are self-funding early phases. One adjoining property has been purchased, and we are planning to develop it into a six unit cohousing community.

Milestones achieved:
1. Membership process defined—to help new families understand our vision/plan.
2. Development legal structure (LLC) registered with Washington State.
3. Startup funds raised; more is committed.
4. Half-acre with three-bedroom house bought by subgroup as site of development.
5. 10-week Aging in Place study group completed with six Songaia families.

Costs: LLC members have committed several thousand dollars during the formation.

Next steps:
1. Join Songaia Announcements mailing list on the Songaia website to be notified of public events, open houses, tours, etc.
2. Contact us, take a tour, come to a meeting and consider membership.
&lt;/div&gt;

      <name>Three Trails CoHousing</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21962&quot;&gt;Three Trails CoHousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Young Adults and Families&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/three-trails-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/three-trails-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Three Trails CoHousing is an “infill” community in early planning stages, located in historic Independence, Missouri.  

A site 2.5 acre has been secured, adjacent to the old spring that wagon trains used to fill their water barrels before heading west on the Sante Fe, Oregon, and California Trails, and close to the historic downtown “Square” area. The site includes a Victorian red-brick home built in 1850, which was the site of at least one Civil War battle. Also adjacent to the site is a restored railroad depot, the Bingham-Waggoner historic home and museum, the Three Trails museum, a recreational complex, many impressive church buildings (church bells chime the hour), and the future site of a fesitival city park that will replace a “brownfield” manufacturing site.

Four families interested in cohousing currently live in existing housing on the site.

A 1900s vintage house will be remodeled as the common house, anchoring a “garden court” design with 20 to 30 residential dwellings, which will be a mixture of small single-family detached homes (existing) and attached townhomes and flats (new). The architecture will emulate historic Independence architectural classics.

Existing housing units are currently available for rent. The current 1887 common house building is undergoing restoration work, with a larger kitchen and dining room to be added in the future.

The project is sponsored by the InTERdependence CoHousing Association, which plans to empower six or more cohousing projects (both “Greenfield” and “infill”) in the greater Independence area over the next 10 years.

We are an intergenerational cohousing community of 41 PassivHaus homes with extensive workshop and office spaces which are used by residents and local businesses. We are based in Halton, 3 miles outside of Lancaster city along the riverside cycle track. We moved in during 2012-13 and opened the eco-workshop spaces (2000m2) in Sept 2013.

We are committed to making Forgebank a cutting edge example of sustainable design and living. The homes are PassivHaus and are built to CSH level 6. We have photovoltaic cells, district heating off a biomass boiler and have plans to install a hydro scheme.

We now have two houses linked by a half acre of land in the progressive Westcott neighborhood of Syracuse, NY, close to Syracuse University and the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. One house is a beautiful 150 year-old historical house on a quiet residential street in Syracuse, NY. The other is over 120 years old, and newly renovated with a kitchen designed for a collective! We practice the idea of &quot;Food, not Lawns&quot; and have an intensive kitchen garden out front, a bathtub salad garden on our driveway, and backyard raised bed production over approximately 1,000 square feet and growing. It hosts several large raised beds, a six-bin compost system, a collection of baby fruit trees, berry bushes, a growing native plant population, and many storm water capture features.  We also have two plots at at Morningside Community Garden which are used for growing more long season crops such as potatoes, cabbage, and garlic. We grow most of our own vegetables June-October, and preserve many types of foods for the winter such as jams, ketchup, salsas, pickles, and tomatoes.

We have a strong commitment to social justice and community participation, with a number of our members involved with local community benefit organizations and initiatives such as Food Not Bombs, The Syracuse Peace Council, The Alchemical Nursery, ArtRage Gallery, the Neighbors of the Onondaga Nation and more. We have organized and led workshops on consensus process and democratic decision making, food preservation, composting, bike fixing, making salves and lotion, natural dyes, and more; and we’ve hosted a number of traveling activists, musicians, and culturally creative persons passing through, or stopping at, Syracuse! With our second house's location on a busy neighborhood street, we hope to increase our educational and community outreach programs.</description>

We completed our condo conversions (meaning all members now own their own units) in October, 2007.

The Family of Light Center is a 107-acre piece of land. Currently there are four homes on the land. In time we would like to create a retreat center geared towards healing, meditation, massage, and spiritual growth. We honor Earth and life. At this point we are not self-sufficient and work out in the community. We are looking for serious members to join us. New people participate in an internship of 3-6 months followed by a year as residents (trial members) before becoming eligible for membership.

      <name>Raw-Wisdom Vegan Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21968&quot;&gt;Raw-Wisdom Vegan Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Healing the Earth  &amp;amp; Ourselves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/raw-wisdom/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/raw-wisdom/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a vegan community with four spirited members plus one on the way. The Raw-Wisdom community started out by simply offering vegan, plant-based diet pot lucks for local residences, and our emphasis remains on natural, healthy, spiritual and environmentally sustainable lifestyles. We offer instructions on organic indoor and outdoor gardening, optimal plant-based nutrition, detoxification and mind/body work. We also manage the educational websites www.raw-wisdom.com and www.healingtalks.com. 

Initial Leadership: The community's reformation has been led by Nathan Batalion, PhD CTN (Certified Traditional Naturopath). Nathan is an author/blogger on health and environmental topics, as well as a nationally ranked triathlete who has 5 years of previous intentional communal living experience (The Barn, Warwick, NY). For more bio and philosophy details: http://www.healingtalks.com/about/.

Assets: The physical assets available include 16 properties. However, 14 of these properties are currently managed as rentals (though if the community expands these rented properties could be converted to community use). Oneonta is a lovely rural town with two colleges - which offers the best kind of setting if one wants to live in a cozy, slow-paced small town surrounding by large expanses of rural areas, while still having the cultural stimulation of a college center (similar to Ithaca NY, home of Cornell University). We also offer a community organic garden at one of the houses plus a composted organic garden at the main house. 

Expanding Activities: We periodically visit with and explore working with other local communities and/or healing professionals to share resources and inspirations. One way we continue to extend our network is through pot lucks or holiday meetings, educational forums, and activism on environmental and health issues. We look forward to sharing both our inner and outer wealth with like-minded, industrious, well-balanced, spiritually healthy individuals who are dedicated to transforming themselves and our culture. We can help such individuals to further transition themselves by means of following more healthy, eco and spiritually aware intentional community lifestyles. 

More on Location: Scenic Oneonta, also known as &quot;City of the Hills,&quot; is nestled within the Catskill Mountains region and along the Susquehanna River. We have plenty of fresh air, water and picturesque rural lands. Oneonta is only three hours from New York City, four hours from Philadelphia, and six hours each from Boston and Washington, DC. If you are planning to come to the general Northeast area, please don't miss visiting us.</description>

Vision:
We are creating a vibrant and beautiful Yoga Eco-Village on the magical island of Bali,Indonesia where people can live healthy, happy, and fulfilling lives.

Our community is a place where people can live in beautiful environmental homes, among magnificent gardens with neighbors who share similar values.

We see Yoga Eco-Village as a pedestrian-oriented community of 80 to 100 people who practice organic fruit and vegetable farming, yoga, and sustainable building, and run ethical businesses.

We believe in creating a lifestyle that meets our social, economic, physical, and spiritual needs.

Principles:

•	Working together in a spirit of harmony to serve each other and humanity.
•	Ethical business: Making and using money for the benefit of society.
•	Sustainability in building, agriculture, energy, transportation.
•	Practical egalitarianism: Striving for equality while being results-oriented.
•	Collective ownership: We are shareholders in our community and businesses.
•	Service: Selfless work for the greater good of the community.
•	Universal spirituality: Yogic, eastern, Buddhist philosophies.
•	Investment of all of our money, intelligence, and heart to achieve our vision.

Community:

Our community is run for the benefit of all of its citizens.

Yoga:

Through daily living and service to each other, we are creating an environment that encourages personal growth on all levels.

Housing:

We believe in building beautiful, environmental, and long-lasting houses as naturally as possible.

Food:

Our primary goal will be to grow the most healthful, nutritious, delicious, and mineral-rich food possible. We will grow 100 percent of the fruit, nuts, and vegetables to nourish our community.

The community leans toward a vegan diet; however, people are free to eat as they choose at their own homes provided it does not interfere with others’ quality of life.

Financial:

We have chosen to use an incorporated company as the best way to hold, manage, and distribute our collective wealth.

•	We own the company as shareholders.
•	The company owns the village.
•	We rent our homes from the company (ourselves).
•	Our shares provide us with “benefits” and dividends for life.
•	We work for the company (optional).
•	The company provides us with the lifestyle we desire.
•	Shares can be earned and/or purchased.
•	Finances of individuals and the community are independent of each other.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21970&quot;&gt;Newbold House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We live in a time of unparalleled change and challenge in our global environment. Climate change, resource depletion, economic crisis, mass extinction of species, conflict and social division threaten our continued survival as a species (Macy &amp; Johnstone 2012). Global consumerism has put us on a collision course with environmental disaster (Worldwide Institute: State of the World 2010). Mental health is declining; depression and anxiety are increasing. The World Health Organisation predicts that by 2020 depression will be the second leading cause of disability throughout the world.
This is a wake up call for humanity and many of us recognise that a positive way of living and working together is urgently needed. This has been described as a ‘Life Sustaining Society’ where we can thrive personally, co-exist in harmony, feel interconnected with the living system of the planet and therefore protect and conserve this for future generations.

At the Newbold Trust we are inspired by the realisation that this is already happening at a global scale! An unnamed, self-organising movement of millions of individuals and organisations with shared values is emerging; from grassroots community led groups to large charities and social enterprises concerned with social and environmental justice, wellbeing and sustainability. It has been called the largest social movement in human history (Blessed Unrest – Hawkins 2007) and it is this movement that the Newbold Trust is part of.

To reflect this we recently revised our Vision and Mission statements. The Vision describes the movement itself, and is shared in essence by many other organisations. The Mission describes our part in this and what we are passionate about sharing with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/newbold-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/newbold-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Newbold House is run by a residential community of members and volunteers. The centre is operated by the Newbold Trust, a limited company with charitable status; dedicated to sustainability, education and open spirituality.</description>

To create a kind of RBE hybrid, transition place, as an example for other people to learn from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/vaia-vilda-apostlar-i-action/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/vaia-vilda-apostlar-i-action/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
A Swedish kind of zeitgeist-minded-community.

We have created a non profit organization, where people have a very high understanding and interest in happy and healthy lifestyle, may it include healthy food, gardening, soil, ecology, air, water, polyamory, relationship, sex, fitness, technology, energy, cooperation etc. The general view is SHARING, CARING and LOVING. It's for you who are interested in living closely with other like-minded people and use our skills together.

What might be found or created in this group is:
•	different kinds of workshops 
•	shows
•	homeschooling...
•	food supplied by ourselves
•	organic food
•	a music studio
•	a pool
•	a sauna
•	a library
•	a car pool
•	etc...

But all this depends on what kind of interest people will have once all members have joined.

There are many advantages of creating this as a non profit org, it makes a lot of paper work easier for us.

It's good if you are interested in vegan/vegetarian or raw food as a lifestyle, or at least an understanding of a lifestyle based on high nutritional food and want to move in that direction yourself. 

We prefer a no-drug lifestyle as much as possible. 

The place for this co-op housing will be in the middle of Skåne (in the south of Sweden), close to nature, a very nice place. We have now found a piece of land that is wonderful and we are preparing to buy it asap! We are forming the new group now and really only miss a few more females to get going (for the gender balance). We have created the association and are gathering more info and key persons. All in all maybe 8-10 adult people can live there. We are 5 now. We have found an architect, a skilled brick layer and other skilled people and we continue to gather more contacts and resources.

We are looking for you who want to  join us and live healthily, sustainably, and cheaply in an organic way.

Our different inspiration (vary from person to person in the group) is ecology, polyamory, the zeitgeistmovement, sustainabilty, free energy, permaculture etc.

Does this sound interesting? Then drop me a line as soon as possible.  

PS. The co-op consist mostly of Swedish people, but is open to anyone who joins from other countries too. Women are high priority for the sake of balance, as are kids.  
And you do have to have some kind of economy to support yourself from the start.

We are looking for you who are eager to live a life with a lot of challenges and personal growth together and share life in as many ways as possible and to have fun!

Don't hesitate, get in contact now!

Washington Village has one of the most desired locations in the heart of Boulder, CO.  Built around the historic Washington Elementary School, this welcoming housing development features 36 warm and inviting private residences, and 2 commercial units, with approximately 7,500 square feet of shared common spaces.  Designed for inspired and comfortable living, Washington Village is a place where neighbors are mindful of one another, while achieving a smarter ecological footprint.

In this collaborative neighborhood diversity is a major asset.   Each neighbor brings their interest, energy and passions to the effort to create a better, more vibrant living environment leading to neighbors that enjoy and care about each other.  Common facilities managed by the community create a hub of creative, intellectual and social stimulation that contribute to the well-being of the residents and the good of the larger society.

      <name>Flatlanders Inn</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21974&quot;&gt;Flatlanders Inn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; People at risk of homelessness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/flatlanders-inn/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/flatlanders-inn/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Flatlanders Inn is a diverse and intentional community located in Winnipeg's North End that seeks to cultivate a positive, nurturing, and relational place to live for people who want to get their feet back under them. 

In technical terms, Flatlanders Inn is “transitional housing for people who are at risk of homelessness.”  We invite neighborhood folk, wanderers, seekers, foreigners and those needing a positive and supportive living environment to join Flatlanders Inn.  Nonetheless, we are creating a way of life that is not solely concerned with getting people into good physical living situations.  We look at why some people become ‘at risk of homelessness’ in the first place, and ask what might have contributed to this situation.  We also concern ourselves with the whole person (taking care to address social, emotional, physical, economic, mental, and spiritual needs) and want to see healing come to every area of each person who lives here.

Flatlanders Inn is also an intentional Christian community that is a ministry of Winnipeg Centre Vineyard Church.  Each person in the community has purposefully chosen to live here and offer themselves to each other.  This means that we work at loving and respecting each other, as well as listen to, learn from, and challenge each other.  We want to build healthy relationships together, with God, and with the earth itself.  Of course there are many barriers to building healthy relationships, and part of our community life is recognizing and removing these barriers so we can grow together and as individuals.

Everyone who who lives at Flatlanders Inn’s contributes to its overall functioning and receives some of the benefits of being part of a community like ours.  We believe that everyone is created in the image of God, and that we’re all given gifts to share with one another.  We believe humans are created to be in community.

Flatlanders Inn might be comprised of families or individuals, old, young, married or single.  Ultimately, we’re creating an atmosphere that is a positive living space for shelter, healing, and growth – a safe place to work through life’s difficulties, celebrate life’s successes, and everything in between.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21975&quot;&gt;Finney Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Please visit our website at www.finneyfarm.org for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/finney-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/finney-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Finney Farm consists of 105 wooded acres located in upper Skagit County, Washington.  The land is wet, fertile, lovely, and green.  Our community exists for many reasons:

•	To steward the land in an ecologically sound manner free from traditional development. 

•	To create and maintain affordable housing, eliminating much of the need for forced wage-slavery.

•	To encourage the sharing of resources.

•	To work toward common goals of self-sufficiency, autonomy, and community.

•	To allow members to pursue personal interests such as creative endeavors, activism, and education on a daily basis.

•	To create an environment in which people are living each day with an expectation of open communication, empowerment, and consensus-based decision making.  

•	To encourage a strong community work ethic, which is beneficial to the community as well as the individual. 

We hope to create an environment in which compassion, respect, consideration, independence, integrity, communication, and living the good life are not qualities to be granted or denied but are instead the expectation.  We seek to hold this land from traditional destructive development, instead using ecologically sound methods for any growth.  The permaculture model isn’t a good fad, it’s a timeless commonsense approach to rural living. 

We envision around 10 families living in hand-built houses living on this land.  We have a shared garden and orchards, community meals, some child-care sharing, and a community house which includes kitchen, laundry, bath, and office facilities.  We also get together for homeschooling, farm work projects, art or craft projects, and performance or volunteer opportunities. 

We would like to create a village feel to our community.  We hope to have many skilled members who are able to share resources and would encourage trading for goods within the community before seeking goods outside of Finney Farm.

We currently have seven adults and four children living on the farm.  We have many skills—journeyman carpenter, seamstress, teacher, mother, wild-edibles enthusiast, homebrewer, knitter, musician, flamenco dancer, spinner, vaudeville and burlesque performer, gardener, tree planter, historian, technical drafter, father, counselor, dancer, laborer, fisherman, bellydance instructor, cook, writer, and much more.  We are anarchists/socialists/discordians who are into both DIY living AND community. And a good life.

2016 Update: We currently have 8 adult residents, a few children, and other short term residents (interns, WWOOFers, short term renters etc).  We occasionally have space available (private rooms in the common house or cabins/tiny houses) please see our website or visit our Facebook page for current availability. We get a huge number of inquiries each year and we are growing at an intentionally slow rate because finding a good fit is more important to us than numbers.  If what you have to offer are &quot;leadership skills,&quot; we probably aren't a good fit. We are also more interested in farming, building, rural living, communication/community, alternative energy skills than drumming, yoga, and empath readings.  We attempt to bridge lifestyle activism with direct action by building a social and educational outreach program in our area which includes our seed distro. In 2015 alone, we grew/harvested/processed/packaged/distributed 8000 packages of organic heirloom seed to schools, food banks, and families at no charge.  We have other outreach programs including events, classes, an intern program, etc.</description>

A special cohousing neighborhood with amenities for proactive adults has been built in the Gold Country of the Sierra foothills in Grass Valley, California. The wooded site is on a hill bordered at the bottom by free-flowing Wolf Creek. It is walkable to shopping, grocery stores, and restaurants. It is also a short walk or bike ride to historic downtown Grass Valley. Of the 7.9 acres total, one-third will be preserved as natural habitat. 

We are a group who share a common vision of allowing people to age in place with grace and dignity while living in community. We include attorneys, teachers, journalists, engineers, medical/dental professionals, nonprofit administrators, musicians, world travelers, bicyclists, kayakers, retirees, and more. We have no age restrictions and our members now range in age from their fifties to ninety+. 

Wolf Creek Lodge houses 30 condominiums and enjoys the convenience of both above and underground parking and elevator access. Members enjoy a large, state-of-the-art kitchen and dining area for optional community meals, laundry and activity space, a beverage/coffee bar, and an inviting sitting area in the 4,000-foot common house. Outside amenities include a hot tub, Petanque court, a large terrace with barbecue, and inviting, environmentally appropriate landscaping. 

The Lodge is self-managed by the entire group and decisions are made by consensus.  

Environmental sustainability is a central value, taking into consideration everything from energy efficient heating and water systems to solar orientation and the use of sustainable, non-toxic building materials. 

Construction began in the fall of 2010, and move-in began in October of 2012. Our friendly and diverse community is still welcomes visitors and new members. Homes become available from time to time. Check our website for currently available homes. 

 Please visit the Wolf Creek Lodge website to learn more about our community.

Kohatu Toa, the hill which gives the Eco-Village its name, overlooks the valley and has spiritual significance for some members of the community.

The community here is dedicated to:

•	Living simply, peacefully, and co-operatively.

•	Protecting and enhancing our environment.

•	Developing a resilient, sustainable economy.

The Eco-Village consists of seven house sites varying in size from 0.26ha to 1.31ha, within community land of approximately 100 acres. The title to each allotment includes an undivided one-seventh share of the common land. 

The community currently consists of about 15 people, including 2 teenaged children. 

As a community we are committed to living lightly on the land, to nurture the valley and ourselves in a way that honours our individuality and supports community development. Social opportunities include weekly community meals and celebrations. Groups of us work together on common land and projects as required. As well as our own gardens, orchards and livestock (mostly chickens) we have a community orchard block and space for community gardens. 

We have a beautiful earthbrick building, owned by the community, which provides shared space for the community as well as meeting and kitchen facilities for workshops and events.</description>

We keep a really clean house.  
Communication, collaboration and participation are the keys to community.

We are a conscious, creative household sharing our beautiful, comfy, two-story, five-bedroom Victorian house. 
This is a great central location in Congress Park, a prime Denver area, in a lovely safe neighborhood near downtown &amp;amp; Cherry Creek. Within walking distance are three parks, shops, restaurants, the Tattered Cover bookstore, the film society cinema &amp;amp; the Botanic Gardens.  

There is wireless internet, a private backyard, a big garden with a pond, six fruit trees and 4 chickens and a duck. We want people interested in building community, sustainability and growing food.

We like to have Airbnb visitors on occasion.  It's fun to meet new people.

This is an opportunity to practice living in community and creating a happy cooperative household as well as participating with gardening and nutritious meals.
How people relate to each other and how they reciprocate is the basis of any society. We change the world by changing how we relate. Interactions based on kindness create peace.

There is a luxurious rental apartment in the carriage house out back, suitable for a couple or single person.  It has a big deck with room for plants.  We would love to have someone there who would be part of our community.  That rent is $17000/mo.</description>

We are making a positive response to the present social condition and plan to be part of the solution by offering to share our land and profit with other like-minded people becoming a worker-owned organic vegetable farm  We have recently purchased a corner property across the road and hope to establish a farm stand there. We have established a growing schedule that works and a market. We currently sell to seed companies, health-food stores, restaurants, and cooperatives. We want the farm to live on after us.
About one acre is wooded and we are expanding the woods. We planted 3 orchards in fall of 2006 - a nut orchard, a stone fruit orchard and what we call a &quot;papple&quot; orchard with apples, pawpaws, persimmons and pears. We prune and plant every year and are starting to get fruit.  We also have perennial berries, herbs, root crops and flowers. Other adjacent lands available. We want to offer classes in raw vegan food preparation and philosophy and sustainable agriculture.</description>

We are all of us interested in the arts, some of us are teachers, others performers. We enjoy cooking together and try to have dinner each night when possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/wits-end-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/wits-end-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Wits End Cooperative is an incorporated co-housing community on 40 quiet mountainside acres just south of Santa Fe, New Mexico. 

The community currently has 5 members, and there is space for two more. We completed our first structure in 2007, and the most recent in 2014. Structures include a common building with a full kitchen, dining area, reading area, laundry, and prospective members' accommodations, of straw bale construction, in the beautiful Ortiz mountains, as well as three private dwellings. We are under an hour from Albuquerque's airport, and a half-hour from the city of Santa Fe; there are many wonderful things to experience in the area. More photos can be viewed at witsendcoop.net or https://www.facebook.com/witsendcoopnm87010/.

We intend our buildings to be as &quot;green&quot; as possible, employing a combination of strawbale, passive solar, water catchment, and recycled materials whenever possible.

The BUEC, as we're called, is an up-and-coming vegan community. We invite interested vegetarian-to-vegan persons who are into exploring communal and community living.

BUEC is currently looking for acreage in the states of Maine, Vermont, and North Carolina.

Various websites on which BUEC is featured include GreenPeople, Intentional Communities, Idealist.org, VegHaven, RainbowCircle, and others.

Briefly, BUEC debunks animal consumption, including that of sentient plants; teaches personal development through veganism; and empowers plant- and animal-rights activism. BUEC intends to become a vegan commune that lives by Good Samaritanship and comports itself with our neighboring communities as a Good Samaritan Commune-ity and E Center that does not discriminate.

We will need people with building, repair, computing, farming  and animal husbandry/veterinary, community liason, and other skills. BUEC intends to build and maintain an animal sanctuary and a healing center on its property, and to build or maintain small condo-style units or apartments, some homes, and other innovative living quarters.

We rent apartments in an eight stories house in central Gothenburg, Sweden. We are 35 persons living here, age 48-80. We share an active social life while growing old together. We have common dinner two days a week. We take car of the house by working together. We have celebration parties whenever we come up with a good reason. Film, literature, cards, traveling, and such is on the agenda. Why this? Because we think that living together keeps us younger, healthier, with less dementia, and above all, there will not be enough people to take care of us when the day comes when we cannot care for ourselves. So we will have to do it ourselves. Website www.majbacken.org</description>

Earth Oriented (Pagan) and all inclusive, we are looking for a few individuals who want to be close to things but have a National Forest as your backyard, which we now have accomplished (Pisgah National Forest).  Our goal was for more land, and when this land is paid in full within the next two years the idea is to purchase more land that backs up to our property.  
Friends have helped to build a small structure I call the Jed Clampett Cabin in the Woods.  It has enough space now for 1 person and the dogs- i.e. Me.  So building extra tiny is the key right now.  Would like to build common kitchen and meeting structures, which I envision small, tiny structures. Would like to build a number of 12X12 size buildings to do what needs to be done, (sleep, eat, and go to bathroom) and spend as much time as possible outside.  Permaculture techniques will be learned and used.  Organic gardening and composting a must.  Self Reliant living OFF GRID and intentional living.  This will require work and is not a free ride arrangement to bang your drums, even though we do that once in a while ourselves, meaning all carry the weight of work, not just some.  Welcome thoughts and for more details contact us.</description>

      <name>Cohousing Co-operative Ltd</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21986&quot;&gt;Cohousing Co-operative Ltd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Cohousing for low incomes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/cohousing-co-operative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/cohousing-co-operative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
On the slopes of the mountain in Hobart, Tasmania, a small cohousing project was completed in 2000 for low-income Tasmanians. The project was funded by the Australian Government, under the Community Housing Project scheme. 

Organised as a housing cooperative, residents underwrite their non-equity housing with both a residency subscription (rent) and contributed services. All aspects of the organisation are managed by the members and residents themselves, via several committees. 

The Cohousing Co-operative has eight goals:
1. Secure and stable support for our children’s needs and growth.
2. A mature group of adults who have and are learning group living skills.
3. A valued, diverse, productive recreational landscape.
4. A safe, secure, and friendly neighbourhood and community.
5. Environmental integrity and sustainable energy practices.
6. Creating, fostering, and mentoring cohousing cooperatives.
7. An autonomous cooperative that engages the wider community.
8. Physical structures that meet the requirements of residents.

This cohousing is particularly unusual for lots of reasons. It is very small (only 13 houses, including the common house), it is government funded, and it is a cooperative as well as cohousing. Despite (or perhaps because of) these features, the community is close-knit, effective, and can be rather intense.

Common meals are held twice a week, site meetings are held fortnightly, and various celebrations and social events happen whenever they happen.

It is a particularly excellent environment for children, with a large, safe outdoor play area backing onto the bush, good communication between parents, and plenty of things to do.

MorningSun is a small and growing community and education center that supports people to discover and unfold their potential for effective and healing action in the world. It seeks to provide a unique learning environment based on sustainable living and a daily practice of mindfulness.

We are developing both the education center and our resident community in a deeply interconnected way. Togetherness, careful loving communication, and willingness to grow through shared mindfulness practice generate a fertile soil in which our programs are growing. Programs focus on developing health, well-being, and sustainability in individuals, families, society, and the environment. They blend focused learning with service work, traditional crafts, and work on the land, and all include a training in mindfulness that supports caring human interaction and helps participants learn to respond to situations of suffering with skill, clarity, and peace.  

MorningSun's programs are being developed for adults, families, youth, and children.

Please visit the website and/or contact us for more information. We welcome inquiries and can accommodate visitors at several times each year.

MorningSun is a project of the Mindful Living Initiative (MLI), a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization that provides education and training for individuals and groups to engage in mindfulness practice and skills of sustainable living in relation to social, economic, and ecological situations.

We care for each other, our surrounding communities, and nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/katywil-farm-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/katywil-farm-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Katywil is restructuring! Our new name is STOWE FARM COMMUNITY (website coming soon). We are still a multi-generational, child-friendly, rural co-housing community in Colrain, Massachusetts. We share resources and work together to nurture and support each other and the land on which we live.

There are currently 8 houses (1 is for sale) and 3 lots still available. 

Stowe Farm Community is rural but not isolated. We have single family homes, which afford privacy within a supportive community. We are neighbors working together to to improve the quality of our lives. Being supportive and helping each other succeed makes our community thrive. Some of us have home businesses and some drive to their jobs. We currently raise chickens, ducks, pigs, and goats. We make cheese and charcuterie (specialty meats), and have plans to grow some ingredients to support our neighbor’s brewery. We have community gardens and a greenhouse. Some day we hope to have a commercial kitchen for small food ventures and shared meals.

We own individual lots, build our own homes and share the rest of the 80 acres, which include arable farmland, pasture to raise animals, and conserved forest. Stowe Farm Community provides a magnificent view down the North River valley to the Catamount Mountains and an uninterrupted expanse of sky. The views are spectacularly beautiful year round. Houses are clustered on a south-facing slope overlooking the West Branch of the North River and Stone Mountain.

We are 20 minutes from Rte. 91; three and a half hours from Manhattan; 45 minutes from the Massachusetts towns of Amherst, Williamstown, and Northampton, as well as Brattleboro, Vermont; 20 minutes from Greenfield, Massachusetts; and 15 minutes from Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts. Our location is near social, arts, and academic communities in the Berkshires.
&lt;/div&gt;

We are working on our new website and hope to have it up soon.</description>

These Missions were very popular in the southwestern US in the 1800s. Today we are seeking refuge for our friends and families from the onslaught of foolishness in mainstream society. We are a peaceful common laws people. We apply healthy living for mental, physical, and spiritual growth.

We are seeking donations in land trusts or other free held property in and around South America. Land must be a minimum 200 hectares with water access. We are also seeking private donations.

Our intention is to live off and respect the land, and teach and learn what our Creator has offered us all. Love to all our relatives. Sovereign, Christian, patriotic, debt-free, mature, honest, free thinking, animal-loving missionaries are welcome.

We share big-ticket items: (cars, motor pool, boats, trailers, heavy equipment, farm implements, plows, shop tools, common areas property). You will receive a home, a horse, a rifle, a shovel, a fishing pole, a blanket, a Bible, twenty dollars of silver, and a hug upon arrival. God bless you.

Our original vision included developing a small vegan intentional community with residential members, education center, and small business enterprises.  Our current activities focus on local food production including veganic gardens, small fruits, nuts, mushrooms, and maple syrup and vegan education/outreach through book discussion groups and vegan potlucks often combined with an educational event. One of our primary goals is to serve as an example of vegan homesteading in action. We have had lots of meetings, workshops, educational events, potlucks, classes, and interested/curious people come to our homestead over the years.  We have evolved towards being a regional educational resource for vegan homesteading and education rather than an intentional community.  However we are definitely interested in connecting with other vegans and are thinking that a &quot;neighborhood&quot; of semi-independent but mutually supportive vegan homesteads/households sharing land in close proximity would be a great model. We are always interested in dialoging with other vegetarians/vegans who are interested in the homesteading life! If you are interested in finding out more about us or would like to schedule a visit please contact us at veg@ahimsavillage.org</description>

We regard ourselves as &quot;rooted in the Christian heritage, open to the wider future,&quot; and welcome people of all faiths and none. Othona West Dorset has a sister community in Essex, together we have a network-style community with hundreds of members. Membership is available to anybody paying a small annual subscription. Many visiting Othona members return regularly over years or even decades.

A small resident core of 6 - 8 live on site, providing hospitality so that up to 35 others (at any one time) can visit for short periods to enjoy an experience of living in community together. We run a programme of workshop weekends, family holidays, retreats etc, which are open to members and non-members of Othona alike. There is a strong volunteer ethic within Othona, so many of our events are facilitated out of love or for a very modest fee. We aim to keep our visitor prices modest.

Community House and its surrounding outbuildings are on seven acres of grounds overlooking the sea, which is a ten-minute walk away through woods and fields. We have an art and craft studio with facilities for pottery, spinning and weaving, painting and games. Our library is very well stocked in the fields of spirituality and progressive theology. This is a relaxing and creative place to be, with an informal and accepting ethos.

Food is plentiful and almost entirely home-cooked, and visitors can help in food preparation. Everyone lends a hand with some simple community jobs each day.

We meet once or twice a day in a beautiful house chapel for worship and spiritual practice, which can take many forms. As an open ecumenical Christian community, we draw on many traditions, including the wisdom of all faiths.

If you are interested in joining the community as a residential member, please look on our website for current vacancies.

Being 10 minutes to the nearest town and only 30 minutes northeast of Seattle gives you access to anything one could need, while also providing the atmosphere of being “away from it all” when on site.
 
Our community has usually consisted of between 5 and 10 people in the last several years and anticipates slow growth over the next few years. Indigenous forest, wildlife, and nature trails with some open spaces make for a quiet, peaceful setting.

DMC values sanctuary, spirituality, harmony, diversity, friendship, cooperation, fun, independent thinking, compassion, and the ability to function within an intentional community. Our members observe many diverse faiths in harmony. Members currently provide information and opinions that are considered by the Advisory Council when making decisions.

DMC members enjoy the company of others for movie nights, gatherings, campouts, meetings, and community meals. Members expect the development of more activities in the future.</description>

Avalon Co-op is an eight-room house intent on creating a safe, sane, and supportive environment as part of the Madison Community Cooperative organization and within the city of Madison as a whole. We are a community that welcomes people of all ages, sexes, colors, sexual orientations and economic backgrounds. Key to our evolution as a healthy and united household is the development and practice of constructive, direct communication, consensus decision-making, and the incorporation of feminist ideals into our everyday lives. 

We are a community of eight people and three cats. Some of us work and some go to school. Our house is centrally located in a quiet and diverse neighborhood two blocks from James Madison Park and four blocks from the capitol. We take turns making great vegetarian meals and working in our garden. We welcome open-minded people who are interested in enriching our community and environment.

International Co-op  House (ICH) has been around for over 25 years. Our premise is that through cooperation a large group of people can live together in pleasant surroundings, with the freedom to determine their own affairs. We endeavor to create a comfortable atmosphere where people feel free to share themselves socially. We are culturally and politically diverse, including both Americans and international persons, and we make our own decisions by majority vote on policy and by consensus vote on membership. Our meal plan includes healthy vegetarian meals and occasional meat dishes. Free laundry facilities, phone, high-speed internet, some parking, and indoor bike storage are available. Our co-op is located two blocks from campus and State Street.  

Contract Terms: We are able to offer early contract release to those who are required to leave Madison.

Located two blocks from campus and State Street, our house has existed for many years. Although we speak many different languages, we are a close group of friends. Our premise is that through cooperation a large group of people can live together in pleasant surroundings with freedom to determine their own affairs. While we are primarily students, our members are culturally and politically diverse, including both Americans and international people.

Sofia Co-op, at 1239 Spaight Street, is a beautiful two-story house with seven bedrooms. The house has original woodwork, three porches, and a backyard with a raised-bed garden. Storage space is available in a large, easily accessible attic.   

We are in a quiet, progressive area in the heart of the Marquette-Williamson neighborhood. The house is a half-block from Orton Park with many amazing trees, one block from Willy Street Co-op, and one block from Lake Monona. Public transportation and bike paths are located nearby.

Currently, we are eight adults and four children. Our ages range from mid twenties to mid forties. 

We are a beautiful and dynamic community that is child-friendly. Our house is clean, cozy, and eco-friendly. We want to live with people who are more than just housemates but rather part of a bigger family that is supportive of personal growth.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21997&quot;&gt;Lotus Lodge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Co-creating a space of mutual respect, awakening, grace and joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/lotus-lodge/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/lotus-lodge/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Lotus Lodge is a unique shared-house community located just 12 minutes from the heart of downtown Asheville, NC. We have 9 adult men and women (about half each), currently ages 20s-70s, in a quiet, 2-story four-plex (converted old 4400 sq. ft. farm house into 4 full apartments that people typically, share plus now a new, 1-room, private studio apartment, all under one roof. Rooms for long or short-term residency open up intermittently, so contact us if interested. Studio apartment ($800/mo plus electric) and rooms (about $500/month plus electric) are furnished, sunny and attractive. Includes WiFi and TV access. Electricity per person is about $44/month on average). Studio is perfect for business travelers or people relocating who need a home space for a few weeks or months. Email (preferred) or call for availability.

The large group room downstairs welcomes everyone and is where we have intermittent movie / TV nights, house concerts, potlucks and sometimes workshop space. Outdoor shared areas include a big front porch, back patio, fire pit, clotheslines (which some use year 'round) organic gardens and rain barrels to water them (into permaculture). Across the street is a wooded walking path alongside Hominy Creek. We are in a semi-rural area (Candler) yet close to all the amenities of downtown Asheville, NC. 

Part of what is unique about Lotus Lodge is that the 9 of us are quite autonomous. Some work full or part time away from home, and/or go into town with some frequency so there's a surprising amount of quiet and privacy, even in the shared apartments. We almost never do meetings and each person has their own food (all types of food are ok, though we all tend toward organic, non-gmo and healthy), own cupboard and refrigerator space, and each determines when to connect with others for mealtime or whatever. This translates to people enjoying each other's company frequently and often eating together mostly on an impromptu, inspired basis with each eating their own food. It flows.

It's really the best of both worlds - of having your own space &amp;amp; life, as well as having a sense of family &amp;amp; community with 8 other friendly, caring, intelligent, interesting and health-conscious people. Some folks do meditation &amp;amp; Qi Kong or Tai Chi regularly, some lean toward vegetarian foods, most also eat some meat, eggs &amp;amp; dairy - and all are free to do their thing. Residents tend to be well educated, progressive, creative, upbeat and great to be around. We enjoy meaningful conversations, laughter, privacy and mutual respect, and we maintain a tidy space.  

If interested in possibly living or staying here, please email me at: gayatri.erlandson@gmail.com with a paragraph about you that includes your ideal timeframe for being here, and a REQUEST for our questionnaire which we'll send to you right away. Once we get your filled-out questionnaire returned, we'll get back to you within a day or so and - if all seems like a go, we can proceed with a call and then a face-to-face meeting(s) here at the Lodge for you and at least some of us to see if we're a good fit. To stay short-term, just email us of your interest or call, 828-581-9036.

If you do join us as a long-term resident, you'll likely enjoy many good times and little drama - and hopefully will stay a good while. No smokers or pets please. Best regards to your collaborative living! Namaste, Gaya Erlandson, PhD (founder, owner &amp;amp; resident committed to healthy, happy living). 

Note: If you are relocating to the area, we can refer you to a really good local real estate broker to be your buyer's agent.</description>

      <name>Hickory Ridge</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21998&quot;&gt;Hickory Ridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; sustainable living in Appalachia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/hickory-ridge/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/hickory-ridge/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hickory Ridge Land Trust comprises 72 acres of ridge-top land and the wooded coves below, and a separate parcel of 70 acres of bottom-land several miles away. Both are in central West Virginia near Spencer, a town of 2400. The ridge-top land is divided into four leaseholds and a common area. All four of the leaseholds are already taken by families. The remaining leasehold has no cleared land currently but a large old garden spot could be readily cleared, and there is a small building left behind. The bottom-land parcel has an existing house in poor condition, and a creek running through it. It's overgrown with autumn olive. A small community has signe3d a lease for this land, so it looks like we have no available leaseholds at present.

While we on the ridge exist as separate households, it’s our intention to share some resources and trade produce. Reducing the use of fossil fuels, living in harmony with the Earth, and working for peace and social justice are values we share. 

Our land has great views and nice woods, but (on the ridge-top) we don’t have a year-round stream. We do have wells, and average annual rainfall here is about 40 inches. We have four seasons, with a few small snowfalls in a typical winter, a long hot, humid summer, a colorful fall, and as for the Appalachian Spring, it inspired a symphony. The local area could never be described as progressive, unfortunately, and jobs are scarce. However, taxes and the cost of living are low, and building codes don't apply here.

One of our members was part of the original commune of 40 years ago. The second couple joined eight years ago, and a single man a couple of years ago. The fourth couple joined in spring of 2016. Our ages range from 36 to 75, plus the new 35-year-old, on the ridge; the people at the bottomland place, which we call the Sako land, are younger. Two households are grid-tied solar powered, two are off-grid. Moving toward collective self-sufficiency is a goal, so we seek people interested in projects like bee-keeping, mushroom growing, keeping dairy goats or other animals, alternative-energy production, etc. Seeking like-minded people prepared to build their own houses and develop agricultural projects. There is a one-time $1000 join fee; after that you pay your share of the property tax and cost of gravel for the road, around $400/year.</description>

We are a group organized as an LLC that that owns a beautiful 120 acre property with waterfront on Post Pond, forest and meadow. We run Loch Lyme Lodge, the 22-cabin based hospitality business we purchased as part of the parcel on which we are also building a 16-24 unit, multi-age, intentional cohousing neighborhood, one mile from Lyme village and 10 miles from Hanover, NH. Pinnacle is appropriate for singles, couples, and families. Lyme is a rural community with two town centers. Hanover is a vibrant college town with an excellent tertiary care medical center. Our design assumes 6-8 apodments/homes integrated into the common house with three or four (4) additional duplexes. We are creating an attractive, comfortable, environmentally intelligent neighborhood in which one can live, raise a family and live long into retirement, aging in your own home within an inter-generational community.  

Our website begins with this paragraph: &quot;Did you ever wish you had a big rambling house on a pond with fruit trees and gardens?...Do you fondly remember your days in college or graduate school and miss the group dinners with stimulating conversation?...Does the idea of living comfortably for less than it costs to live on your own appeal to you?.&quot;

Our work focuses on collective intelligence and emerging forms of grassroots, collective organization. Recent projects explore formal decentralization and politically-engaged art, in the form of trainings, workshops, think tanks, curricula, and street actions. Nsumi's membership is fluid, expanding and contracting as needed, morphing into other groups or spawning new offshoot collectives or networks, openly or clandestinely, for short or long durations, responsive to and in relation with our environment. Nsumi’s common interest is exploring the creative capacity of social networks and experimental groups. We produce and participate in exhibitions and events, and conduct research on public art, fine arts pedagogy and emerging collaborative practices. Nsumi creates collaborative artwork combining planning and architecture, social engagement, and systems design.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22003&quot;&gt;The North Hill at Staurolite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; land conservation community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-north-hill-at-staurolite/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-north-hill-at-staurolite/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The North Hill at Staurolite, in Brasstown, NC, ten minutes from the John C. Campbell Folk School is a 60 acre conservation by design community offering 40 acres of permanently protected green space through a conservation easement with the Land Trust for the Little Tennessee. A residential community of 10 home sites, The North Hill at Staurolite offers a traditional village-like setting designed to protect natural resources and wildlife habitat and to encourage social interaction to facilitate community. The home sites, in sizes from 1.05 to 3 acres, are all south facing and offer mature hardwood, white pine forest or pasture edge settings, with wonderful long range mountain and pasture views.

Conservation by design is a concept refined by environmental planner, Randall Arendt that uses a land conservation approach to development.  First, the important features and qualities of a site such as springs and streams, ridgetops, hardwood forests and viewsheds are identified and mapped and then aside to be common conservation spaces. The less sensitive areas then become the potential development areas used for roads and individual home sites. These are selected and arranged to take advantage of social interaction and open space features. Homes and building construction are governed by architectural and environmental guidelines.

The North Hill at Staurolite is a new community whose membership includes shared ownership and access to the 40+/- acres of protected common spaces, wells, roads and underground utilities. The protected common spaces include community garden areas, a picnic shelter, scattered viewing sites, a fire ring, viewing sites and over 1.5 miles of interconnected walking trails. Each home site is bordered by and connected to a series of pathway trails that offer options for access into and through both the neighborhood areas and natural conservation lands. Using both existing old road beds, abandoned fence lines and perceptible animal paths, the multiple trails vary in distance, view, terrain and level of exertion. In addition, The North Hill at Staurolite design includes an identified site for a future building that can include a kitchen, library, studios, or other identified community needs. Consensus will guide community decision making and reasonable covenants and restrictions will structure future choices and changes. 
The community is located 2.5 hours from Atlanta and Athens, GA; Chattanooga and Knoxville, TN and Asheville, NC.

We are co-stewards with Tryon Life Community Farm and the Bridgewalkers Alliance of seven beautiful half-wooded acres surrounded by a 650-acre forest, all inside Portland on a bus line half an hour by bicycle from downtown. (TLC Farm is a separate and independent nonprofit sustainability education and demonstration center--see www.tryonfarm.org. The BWA is a POC and trans collective focused on making the land available to marginalized people who have less access to land.) We are blessed with the opportunity for the work of our relations with each other and the earth to be shared with thousands of visitors. As we learn the skills and practices of growing respect, responsibility, and joy, they resonate out through our communities.

In this way, we're becoming ancestors of an earth people that navigate the coming tumult with spirit and courage.

We were born in fire. Our evolution on this land between 2004 and 2006 was galvanized by the campaign to prevent the land we occupy from being bulldozed for a high-impact housing development. We have faced the stresses, conflicts, and tensions this high-pressure environment caused, as well as the &quot;standard&quot; ones all communities face, and have developed a clear focus on community process to deal with them.

It is a lot of work to live here. Members pay the equivalent of market-rate rent, and are expected to contribute at least ten hours to the community's economic work every week, and volunteer with TLC Farm (many do more). We have weekly meetings, alternating between business &quot;meetings of the minds&quot; and relation-building &quot;meetings of the hearts.&quot; We share evening meals and rotate cooking, cleaning, and maintenance chores. We encourage low-impact density and so have relatively little individual space (though a great deal of shared, communal space).

And yet the rewards are tremendous. We live deeply interwoven with all our relations. We encourage each other to discover our evolving niches in the ecology of change: political action, deep spirit, earth-rooted wisdom. We reduce our ecological footprint, learn the resonance between autonomy and cooperation, grow into wisdom and compassion, and jam rhythms and harmonies and sutras into the long, warm evenings.

Members are encouraged to use alternate forms of transportation (we have a car co-op), minimize energy use (no central heating), and eat local, organic, unrefined food. Our regular community ceremonies (from circles around dinner to high holidays) reflect our eclectic backgrounds, but are earth-based and heart-felt.

We encourage positive, proactive, partnership-oriented approaches to improving the well-being of our neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/halcyon-commons-cooperative-urban-neighborhood/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/halcyon-commons-cooperative-urban-neighborhood/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
This isn't cohousing but a cooperative urban neighborhood, the center of which, Halcyon Commons, is a park designed and built by neighbors where there once was a parking lot in the middle of the street (process begun in 1992, completed in 1996, with new features added in 2008). Through Halcyon Neighborhood Association, neighbors have organized regular community potlucks, a strong crime watch, community animal and child gatherings in the park, a regular email newsletter that reaches 540-plus households, strong disaster preparedness, regular community park cleanups and weeding/mulching work parties, concerts in the park, and other celebrations. Halcyon neighborhood is a wonderful place to live, with high walkability to transit, restaurants, grocery, etc.

[Please note: We are NOT in the position to provide real estate or rental information, and we're unable to host visitors. We do NOT offer housing, so please do not contact us to inquire about housing. While we welcome new community-minded folks to join our neighborhood, it's up to you to look into the usual sources for an urban area to find housing options here; our website gives you a map of the general boundaries of the neighborhood (the Google map isn't our neighborhood, just our zip code! we're located Telegraph to Adeline, Ashby to Woolsey, in South Berkeley near the Oakland border, though we also have a number of people who live a bit outside our boundaries who participate regularly).]

Braziers Park is a community, a residential college, and an architectural treasure hidden deep in the south Oxfordshire countryside. It was founded in 1950 as an educational trust, and is a continuing experiment in the advantages and problems of living in a group. Community members share responsibility for running the college and the estate.

&quot;To make conscious the shape of the process of which we are a part, so that we may facilitate its development more efficiently.&quot;

We keep pigs and oxen; we plant trees and vegetables; we live in the midst of beauty, and we eat well; we argue joyfully on good days; we argue pointlessly, and/or ignore each other on bad days. Lots of dreams and fantasies are stimulated here. There is always work to do...

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22007&quot;&gt;Ahupuaa Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Health, Happiness and Longevity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ahupuaa-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ahupuaa-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Welcome to Ahupua’a Village!  We currently lhave work trade accommodations and would also like to talk to potential community members who have their own income  but would like to share the community facilities with us.  
We are growing many crops in our beautiful garden and are continuing to build terraces down into our lovely jungle property. 
 
We are currently looking for workers who can work with us 3 days a week (overall 20 hours) on major projects and daily upkeep of the property and garden.
 
Ideally a longer-term stay is what we are hoping for, as there is much to learn and it is nice to have consistency. A couple who would be willing to split up tasks of gardening, housekeeping, cooking, carpentry etc. would be a great asset to our project, but individuals are also accepted.
 
Upon receiving your application, we will send your our Mission Statement, written by our master gardener and team leader. 
 
Skills in fields of marketing and sales are particularly of interest to us now as well as we are moving closer to becoming a market garden!
 
We look forward especially to hearing from those of you who are willing to make a 3-month minimum commitment to our project.  For shorter stays,we often have a cabin with use of the garden and all facilities, available at about $250  per week.  This would enable our visitor and us  to determine whether a long stay might be desirable.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22008&quot;&gt;Putney Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are creating a small, cooperative neighborhood of diverse individuals, sharing friendship and support while living independently in an ecologically responsible community, making decisions through consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/putney-commons/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/putney-commons/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Putney Commons (www.putneycommonsvt.com) is a small, owner developed, friendly intentional community located in Putney, Vermont. We are in our sixth year as resident owners and tenants. Six homes were completed in 2009, one is being built now and we are seeking two additional households to join us. There are two building sites available for building, and also one of the original homes is for sale.
The latest home to be built is a Unity modular home which fits right in with the original homes.

 A new builder/member may design their own home and select a contractor and architect, if needed, of their own choosing. The size and design require Association approval. 
New members must be able to finance the building of their own homes.
 The original houses are single-story, built on slabs, super-insulated with a Five Plus Star Energy rating, 1100 to 1500 sq. ft. and south facing. Each home includes a garage and storage unit. The interior designs vary greatly based on owner designed preferences. Four houses have photo voltaic panels; one household has a subscription to a local solar farm. 
We share a vision for being good stewards of the land, and supporting one another in living greener and healthier lifestyles.
Members meet monthly to discuss business and living concerns using consensus decision making. Individuals are e involved in varied activities in Putney and nearby Brattleboro. We plan times to be together to enjoy pot luck dinners and occasional work days.
There is a $175 monthly owner's association fee. 

Our almost twelve acres of land are secluded and private. We enjoy being within walking distance of medical offices, post office, bank, restaurants, library, food coop, as well as close to many rich cultural offerings. Putney village is a &quot;transition town,&quot; a movement to vitalize community response to the need for local sustainable living.
See: transitionputney.com, iputney.com,
sandglasstheatre.com, yellowbarn.org, and putneycrafttour.com 
  Acreage includes fields, woodlands, vegetable garden, and walking trails. The Connecticut River and Putney Mountain offer hikers, bikers, rowers, kayakers, and swimmers many opportunities for enjoyment.  There are several private schools and a college nearby. Many community based events are held throughout the year. The food co-op is one of the oldest cooperatives in the country and a center of the town. 
 We are located just off US Rte 5, via exit 4 off I-91, ten miles north of Brattleboro. 

Interested? Contact us by email or phone and then plan to meet with us.

Polestar creates dynamic opportunities for life-long learning and spiritual growth based on the universal teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda.

Our Values:
    Our essential purpose is “the deepening of the spirit”.
    We seek to create a culture that values spirit, community and life-long learning.
    We strive to express the universal teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda and other great spiritual traditions.
    We aspire to celebrate the sacredness of life in the company of dear friends.
    We promote tolerance, compassion and service to others as a pathway to individual and world peace.
    We understand that life is a sacred opportunity to grow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/polestar-gardens-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/polestar-gardens-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Polestar is an intentional, spiritual community on the Big Island of Hawaii.
 
We offer year-round, hands-on experience in cooperative living (through a work exchange program) based on the universal teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda, author of the spiritual classic, &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;. We also offer opportunities for personal retreat and vacation, as well as many dynamic programs for families and youths. 

Our core values are spirit, community and life-long learning.

As we often say, we try to &quot;eat, meditate, work and play&quot; together. We have found these elements to be the fundamental glue that sustains our community.

We strive to &quot;keep the main thing, the main thing&quot;. That is to say, to keep our focus on spirit - maintaining our connection to our deeper Selves - at the center of our lives.

We are vegetarian, with a recreational drug and alcohol-free lifestyle, (this is a non-negotiable policy). Among various educational and inspirational programs, we offer internship and work trade programs for those who are interested in raja yoga, building, organic gardening, sacred music, art &amp;amp; creativity, alternative healing, and many other skills for living. We are on 20 beautiful acres on the Big Island of Hawaii with deep soil and a year-round growing season.

We aspire to Yogananda's ideal of simple living and high thinking and see meditation and service as our path to living fulfilled lives. We invite those who share these values to join us in creating a community that supports continuous physical, mental, and spiritual development.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22010&quot;&gt;Sand River Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; 55+ cohousing community with emphasis on conscious aging, sustainability, and decision-making by consensus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sand-river-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sand-river-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;WHO WE ARE

(Formerly called ElderGrace, we changed our name to Sand River in 2012.)

In dedicating ourselves to lifelong personal growth, friendship, respect for the environment, and service to others, we aspire to embody the following values:

WISDOM. We respect the diversity of paths to personal growth. Deepening our connections to the natural world and others in the place that we live is a significant part of conscious aging.

COMMUNITY. We live in a respectful, egalitarian community which uses a modified consensus process to guide our decision making. We are creating a peaceful, aesthetically pleasing environment that nurtures a sense of community and individual contentment.

FRIENDSHIP. We value one another and the expression of mutual caring. We cherish and celebrate our diverse origins, joys, talents, beliefs, and life experiences.

ENVIRONMENT. We affirm a sustainable future by conserving resources and living ever more lightly on the Earth.

SERVICE. We offer service to the larger community both as individuals and as representatives of Sand River.


LIFE AT SAND RIVER

WE WORK AND WE PLAY. We are actively engaged in community—with one another as well as with the hands-on business of establishing and operating a healthy, viable cohousing village. In our monthly community meetings we address current issues and the day-to-day business at hand while various teams plan and execute the necessary tasks under their care, sometimes with the assistance of the rest of the community.

THE COMMON HOUSE is the heart of our community where we prepare and share dinner together once a week, study tai chi or take a poetry class, watch films, and engage in fireside chats on conscious aging.

WE ARE NEW and building from the ground up—in some ways quite literally. In this creative and demanding stage of development, we welcome new members, as homes become available, who would like to join us in realizing our values and goals for a more caring and sustainable community and world.

SAND RIVER IS A LEED* community with the following sustainable design features: universal design, permeable paths and trails, accessible public transportation, community open space, water-saving features, rainwater harvesting, native plants and trees, passive solar orientation, in-floor radiant heat, healthy indoor air quality, Energy-Star qualified, 30% more energy efficient, low e windows, blown-in cellulose insulation, photovoltaic-ready hookups

*LEED-certified buildings save money and resources, and have a positive impact on the health of occupants, while promoting renewable, clean energy.</description>

Tamarack Knoll is a rural cohousing community eight miles west of Fairbanks and two miles from the University of Alaska. We have nine resident adults and four children. The individual cabins/small homes are privately owned, and the land, commons building, and improvements are held in common through a nonprofit corporation / condominium legal structure. 

We share evening meals, and have a water source at a commons building (shower, bath, washing machine, and communal kitchen). Our community is very rural, though not remote, in the boreal forest. We have gravel driveway access to the commons building, and foot trails to the individual units. We keep about 95 percent of our 80 acres in green space. We are on an extensive network of multiple-use ski and dogsledding trails. 

We have some ongoing construction, but the community has been functioning since 2004. A number of us are involved in research through the University of Alaska, Fairbanks; and several of us are in public service. We are active in environmental organizations, conservation, and wilderness preservation. We are very engaged in outdoor and wilderness activities.

Our common values include promotion of a sustainable lifestyle, with a focus on cycling and housing stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-hub-housing-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-hub-housing-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
In January 2005 we bought a six-unit apartment building in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago. We currently have nine members and have two memberships for sale, one that comes with a one-bedroom apartment and the other that comes with a two-bedroom.

Our building has six apartments and our common spaces are our courtyard, and large basement.  Our lifestyles are examples of sustainable living; we have a large storage space for bicycles, a bike workshop in our basement, and bike mechanics in the coop.  Some of us use the bicycle as our main means of transportation.  We also compost, recycle, and buy food in bulk through other coops and community sustainable agriculture (CSA).  We are activists within the community for various causes.  We work by consensus and for the good of our community.  We are often found munching on something delicious at one of our regular potluck events.  We are open to sharing our experiences of starting a coop.  Let us know if you would like to visit!

For 2018 Dandelion is accepting only female applicants and moms of female child(ren) 

We make decisions based on consensus and we share living space, meals, income, expenses, and labor. We value feminism, permaculture, cooperation, open communication, simplicity, honesty, nonviolence, and the willingness to resolve conflict.

We are located on approximately nine acres of land in rural northeast Missouri positioned within a network of other intentional communities. We have an annual garden, a high-tunnel hoop house, and a young orchard of fruit, nut, and timber trees, all which we garden organically.

We have many systems in place, and we aim to keep our lifestyle simple, yet fulfilling. It means a lot to us to have control over our own time.

Dandelion is a sub-community of Red Earth Farms. (see redearthfarms.org) Our goal is to become a family-style group of 5-8 adults, and we are open to children as well. More living space will need to be constructed as our population increases. Currently it is myself and my daughter half-time living here.

We are looking for self-motivated individuals to join and help grow this egalitarian, family-style sub-community. People who value simple living, personal growth, living in alignment with the universe, living closely with the earth, not spending a whole lot of money, regenerative/sustainable living, non-violent and direct, honest and open communication. Must be kid friendly. Prior community experience extremely helpful. Enjoy growing, preparing and eating healthy, delicious food a plus. Need to be self-motivated.

This is a somewhat rustic setting (no running water/hot water on demand/indoor shower, no refrigerator, no washer/dryer). We have telephone and internet, and a small off-grid electical system. We use hand tools and do all our cooking and heating with the sun and with wood gathered mainly from our property.

We want others to bring their skills and creative energy to come help Dandelion blossom into an active, thriving sub-community.

The Eliopoli Project is willing to create an innovative global village in Nova Scotia, Canada. An ecovillage is a model that transforms human settlements into a full-featured sustainable community, harmlessly suited to the natural environment. Eliopoli is a different way of conceiving the ecovillage concept. Indeed, it integrates environmental sustainability, education, social responsibility sharing, participation, decisional and alternative technology with a pragmatic approach that comprehends the development of economical and business activities. 

Eliopoli is aimed to create wellness and prosperity to its stakeholders, and represents a cutting edge experiment for a new holistic lifestyle.

Alternative news often speak of disturbing future events, which may leave with a mixture of fear and despair. Yet there is light at the end of the tunnel, a positive timeline for our future, the occurrence of which depends on each one of us. Just yesterday, a friend asked me &quot;what can I do practically&quot;? It is not easy when you are overwhelmed by daily life. Today I propose a simple gesture for everyone, to support a future based on compassion, and harmony with nature and among men. Eliopoli wants to show that a new life model that underlines the qualitative aspects of life can be realized focusing on human needs in a way compatible with business and environment . Help us to spread the new by reaching 999 supporters.&lt;/li&gt;

Nubanusit Neighborhood &amp; Farm is a cohousing community in Peterborough, New Hampshire, located in the southwestern Monadnock region of the Granite State, just 90-minutes from Boston. Our neighborhood consists of 29 environmentally-designed homes; a spacious Common House; professional office space in a renovated historic farmstead; an organic farm; woodlands with walking trails; and a pond for swimming and skating. The neighborhood is located on 113 acres along Nubanusit Brook, about a one-mile walk (sidewalks) from the center of town, a thriving small town made famous by playwright Thornton Wilder's Our Town.

We are 29 households aged from baby to 80+ years.  We work from home, commute, and are retired.  We attend public, private and homeschool.  We own our homes and rent.  We value sustainability, community, farming and living lightly on the earth.

A single-family home in our neighborhood is LEED Platinum certified (US Green Building Council); all of the buildings are constructed to the same rigorous environmental standards and use less than half the energy of typical houses. Our architect-designed, New England farmhouse-style homes all have front porches and are sided with red cedar shingles. Each home is superinsulated with triple-glazed windows, infrastructure for solar hot-water collectors, and natural, nontoxic materials chosen for quality and durability. The entire neighborhood is heated by a central wood-pellet fired heat plant. 

Hardwood and tile floors are used throughout the homes; the interiors are light, airy, and spacious. First floors feature a kitchen and open-concept living/dining room with a full mudroom entry and half bath/laundry room. The second floors consist of a master bedroom, full bath, and additional bedrooms. Private living spaces have views of woods, farm fields, or the river. We are a pedestrian-friendly neighborhood, with vehicles limited to the parking area at the periphery. 

Our farm includes fields for pasture, hay, vegetables, and fruits. There is also an apiary, layer chickens, pigs (seasonally), horses and occasional cows. 

Peterborough is a quintessential New England town located in a nature-lover’s region of mountains, ponds, rivers, and picturesque villages. Our town is a vibrant arts and cultural center, and is home to the world-renowned MacDowell Artists Colony. We have good public schools, as well as Waldorf and other private daycare, preschool, elementary, and high schools.

My website shows designs for biologically sustainable, landscaped, vegan communities. I am looking for benefactors who would be interested in providing funding for and living in such an environment where we grow and eat primarily our own organic food. I envision many of us requiring only part-time jobs for income and being part-time gardeners on our own land. There should be more quality time for more human activities than the average person currently experiences in the usual nine to five city lifestyle.

There are graphical, in-depth designs for a five-acre, 10-acre, and 20-acre and 40-acre community for 10 people, 20 people, 40 people and 80 people respectively on my website. If you think you might be interested in providing funding for and living this way, please email me.

      <name>Ames Cohousing</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22018&quot;&gt;Ames Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to create a sustainability activism community focusing on finance, food, and energy. A large component of our efforts is promoting the universal basic income movement, and alternative currencies that demonstrate the tangible economic value that basic income provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ames-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ames-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ames Cohousing is a retrofit cohousing community within walking distance of Iowa State University. It is both easy to get to by car, less than 15 minutes from interstate 35, and a completely walkable and bikeable community, with the University 5 blocks away, and a employee-owned grocery store chain 4 blocks away.

We use the phrase eco-village, but we are really in an eco-state. When it's windy, Iowa produces more energy that it uses, and the City of Ames municipal utility listens when citizen activists ask for more renewables. With your help, we could make the entire city of Ames and Iowa State University be net carbon-negative in 5 years. This starts with conversion of the two houses to use entirely electric/hydronic heat so we can heat water when the wind blows, and store that energy for when it does not.

One of our members has a 350 farm in northern Iowa growing human food soybeans, and would like to see you join us and help develop food finance and distribution models that let us feed people, not capital.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22020&quot;&gt;Rocky Corner Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Rocky Corner is a vibrant cohousing neighborhood. We nourish respectful relationships among our members, as well as with the natural environment and the wider community.

Rocky Corner cohousing is committed to creating a balance between independence and interdependence.

     The community consists of privately owned, self-sufficient homes and a common house, which includes facilities  for shared meals and a variety of other community resources.
    Our neighborhood is pedestrian centered.
    We maintain a balance of private and community life with respect for individual and family needs for quiet, autonomy and privacy.

We are dedicated to fostering a friendly, open, vibrant, mutually supportive atmosphere.

    Our communications, relationships, actions and behavior are honest, direct, respectful, nonviolent and caring.
    We are committed to equal access to power in decision-making. Our primary way of attaining this goal is by using sociocracy.
    We strive to create a neighborhood that is supportive and inspiring for individuals and families.
    Our community promotes the physical and emotional health, safety and security of our members and guests.
    We make space in our lives for play and artistic expression. We encourage continual learning, skill sharing and teaching.
    We seek out and are open to new ideas and to all interested people who share our vision and values and are able to share fully and fairly in community responsibilities.

Rocky Corner is multigenerational.

    We support people of all ages to enter, stay and participate in the community throughout their lives.
    We value children as members of the community and encourage their participation and leadership.

We actively sustain our community and maintain our property by sharing work and responsibilities.

    Our community is planned, designed and managed by the members with attention to aesthetics and in a manner that supports our vision.
    We work cooperatively for mutual benefit.
    We make ownership as affordable as possible.

We serve as an active member of the wider community.

    We engage our neighbors in the greater community by inviting participation in our play, in our art and in our work, and as formal advisors to our community’s self-governance.
    Rocky Corner members are involved in a broad variety of activities and organizations in the wider community.

We are devoted to preserving, protecting, nurturing and regenerating the natural environment.

    We are committed to learning about and adopting practices that minimize consumption of energy, water, and other natural resources.
    We strive to balance farming and community life with the preservation of wildlife habitats.
    We consider the Rocky Corner community, the wider human community and the health of the Earth when making decisions and choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/green-haven-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/green-haven-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Rocky Corner is the first cohousing neighborhood in Connecticut. We are presently building on our 33-acre former dairy farm in the town of Bethany.  With a beautiful New England setting, yet only about five miles north of New Haven, this is an inclusive, multi-generational community, valuing diversity of culture and background. Many homes are spoken for, but we have all sizes available (1,2 and 3 bedrooms). Move in is planned for spring 2019.

Caring deeply about the health of the planet we are committed to green building and living sustainably. With Centerbrook Architects we have cooperatively designed 30 passive solar, single family homes. These are clustered near the 4,500 square foot common house for shared meals, leisure, and work space.  We were chosen to receive a large grant from the state of Connecticut to help make some of our homes “affordable” (below market rate). 

Working with Appleseed Permaculture to make the best use of the farmland and watershed, we are creating a landscape of flowers, berries, orchards, annual vegetables, pasture, wild flowers, paths and ponds. We will have enough space for those who are interested to grow a substantial amount of our food, including a greenhouse for an extended growing season.

The site plan is people-centered, with cars on the perimeter yet conveniently accessible to each unit. 

Valuing participation, we have adopted sociocracy as our organizational and decision-making model, and have trained with John Buck, Jerry Koch-Gonzalez and Diana Leafe Christian.

At this time we have applicants to fill our affordable homes, and there is a waiting list for eligible applicants.There are still a few market-rate homes available.  Please contact us if you are interested in purchasing a home, getting on the waiting list, or for more information about Rocky Corner Cohousing. 

Rocky Corner -- a great place for families, for singles, for aging in place; a safe, cooperative, supportive community.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22021&quot;&gt;Cohabitat Québec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; - Continuer à développer un milieu de vie écologique et coopératif grâce au partage et à l'intelligence collective des membres copropriétaires occupants. 

- Animer une communauté d'adultes, de jeunes et d'enfants et soutenir leur engagement dans le vivre ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/cohabitat-quebec/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/cohabitat-quebec/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;COHABITAT QUÉBEC : Un Syndicat de copropriété divise géré par une coopérative de solidarité.

Cohabitat Québec, coopérative de solidarité, a conçu le projet et fait construire le premier cohabitat au Québec. Les quarante-deux (42) unités d’habitation en copropriété divise forment le Syndicat de la copropriété Cohabitat Québec, enregistré le 3 juin 2013.

Cohabitat Québec est situé dans le quartier Saint-Sacrement de l’arrondissement La Cité-Limoilou, au 1650 rue Louis-Jetté. Les membres du cohabitat partagent des valeurs d’entraide et de bon voisinage et participent à toutes les étapes de gestion de leurs habitations.

Propriétaires-occupants, ils ont à cœur leur insertion harmonieuse dans le quartier et souhaitent contribuer à la vitalité de Saint- Sacrement. Ils partagent une « Maison commune », pourvue de nombreux services (grande cuisine et salle à manger, salle de jeux pour les enfants, chambres d’invités, buanderie, atelier, etc.).</description>

      <name>D Acres of New Hampshire</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22022&quot;&gt;D Acres of New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Organic Farming, Forestry &amp; Education&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/d-acres-of-new-hampshire/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/d-acres-of-new-hampshire/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
D Acres of NH is a nonprofit organic farm and homestead. The mission of the organization is to function as an educational center that researches, applies, and teaches skills of sustainable living and small-scale organic farming. The idea is to work cooperatively to achieve many of the roles a farm can play in the community. The project serves as a community center and producer of agricultural products. Instead of the common farm dilemma of seeking work offsite to supplement income, we are looking for creative ways to generate on-farm income. D Acres of NH serves as a model of the modern small farm in New England. The economic and social possibilities of the farm as a center for healthy food, face-to-face communication, education, and goods and services are endless. The vision of this farm is to provide stewardship for the rural landscape while also serving the community. We share with the public through food events, hands-on workshops, themed fairs, tours, localization invigoration, and educational outreach to local schools. 

D Acres activities include no-till gardening, sustainable forestry with oxen, waste food collection as a feed source for D Acres pigs, wood-fired cooking, alternative building (tree houses, cordwood, cob, stone masonry, recycled timber frames, and recycled glass). Additional activities include woodwork, blacksmithing, print making, jewelry making, fiber arts, use of alternative energies (photovoltaic, solar hot water, waste veggie oil, and wood), a hostel, and a trail system through our 180 acre woodlot. 

There are many facets to development aimed at creating rural ecological society. The idealistic vision is to provide the positive aspects of traditional and current technologies as a means of producing a simple yet comfortable standard of living. This must involve conservation and adaptation to reduce our fossil fuel consumption. Another facet of this project is the use of the consensus process enabling individuals to cooperatively pursue this ideal. Economics is important as well: D Acres endeavors to exhibit methods for on-farm revenue generation especially through cottage crafts made from onsite renewable resources.

      <name>EcoReality Co-op</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22023&quot;&gt;EcoReality Co-op&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our focus is permaculture, sustainable living, food and energy production, and education.

Because humans have tipped the planet out of energetic balance, leading to increasing overpopulation, conflict, famine, and extinction, possibly of humans themselves, we, the members and advisors of the Ecoreality community agree to honor our individual roles as part of a collective that is committed to sustainability in all its forms. 

Here is our mission (an action plan that guides us):

We choose to build a loving community together in the South Gulf Islands of British Columbia, Canada. 
As a community, we pledge to learn by practice and exploration how to apply principles of ecology, non-violence, awareness, diversity, and education toward the achievement of a lifestyle that is a result of intentional sustainable actions and alternatives to the state of the world (see first line). To do this, we agree to use clear, compassionate communication and written process, and to empower people through ongoing group awareness and processes that promote personal responsibility and accountability. We agree to share knowledge and materials in ways that promote our community values. Finally, we will support our mission actions by appropriate tools that we all agree to use, such as consensus decision-making. 
 
Furthermore, we endorse a common set of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.EcoReality.org/wiki/Values&quot;&gt;values&lt;/a&gt; in priority order, from which we derive our common &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.EcoReality.org/wiki/Vision&quot;&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.EcoReality.org/wiki/Purpose&quot;&gt;purpose&lt;/a&gt; statements, the latter of which we periodically review and ratify by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.EcoReality.org/wiki/Consensus&quot;&gt;unanimous consent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ecoreality/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ecoreality/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
EcoReality Sustainable Land Use and Education Cooperative is developing an ecovillage in the south Gulf Islands of British Columbia, Canada. This ecovillage will be a model of sustainable food and energy production and will include public outreach and education as goals.

We have acquired a 43-acre property next to a 61-acre “community farmland” site, backed by a thousand of acres of public parkland, all the way to the highest peak on the island, and down to the ocean.

The property has cleared, productive farmland (mostly in hay), riparian and laucustrine areas, and young forest. The public parkland extends from the highest point on the island (Bruce Peak, at 704 metres), all the way to the ocean at Burgoyne Bay, and up the other side to the second-highest point (Mount Maxwell, at 579 metres).

All of the property is irrigated by a two-acre pond and two year-round streams via an extensive buried irrigation system. The class-2 soils are in growing zones 8 and 9. We have been implementing a Permaculture design for the site.

Two houses with a total of 4,200 sq ft of living space have eleven bedrooms, four bathrooms, and two kitchens between them, as well as ample room for meetings and home-based businesses. Three members live in these buildings, sharing them with renters, WWOOFers, and visitors.

A garage/studio/workshop of about 1,200 sq ft is used as a classroom for Permaculture and agriculture classes and public events. The classroom seats 40.

We also have a 3,550 sqft &quot;high tunnel&quot; poly greenhouse, divided into zones for propagation, nursery, and direct seeding.

New as of September 2016: we have salvaged a wonderful 3,080 sqft glass and aluminum greenhouse, currently in pieces, awaiting drier weather so we can start foundation work.

We have begun a public education campaign leading to re-zoning that will enable construction of a number of additional dwelling units. Current zoning allows three additional houses and a cottage. We have completed studies that show a larger number of dwelling units are appropriate, based on both carrying capacity of the land and agricultural labour needs, which is the legal requirement for more dwellings. This will be a political process, with at least three government bodies and public hearings involved.

We are seeking additional members who can contribute approximately half the value of a typical North American suburban house to the project. Prospective members with outstanding skills who can contribute less are encouraged to contact us.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22024&quot;&gt;MOSAIC Co-op&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Through cooperative action, MOSAIC seeks to develop a diverse, inclusive community which inspires and empowers creative, conscious, sustainable living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/mosaic-communities/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/mosaic-communities/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;MOSAIC (&quot;Members of Society Acting in Cooperation&quot;) began as the brainchild of a group of Northwestern students who were interested in finding an alternative form of student housing in Evanston. They founded the original house at 2013-2015 Ridge Avenue, and in September of 1998 the first 12 co-op members moved in. 

They established the original mission statement and developed a house structure based on cooperative living. Using the mission statement, they tried to guide the activities of the house along principles such as environmental sustainability, consensus decision making, and social &amp; political activism.

In the summer of 2004, MOSAIC moved to its current location at 2000 Sherman Avenue (known as &quot;The Zooo&quot;), where we have resided ever since. Additionally, in 2015, MOSAIC expanded to a second house at 1427 Elmwood Avenue (&quot;The Treehouse&quot;). Today, MOSAIC is a vibrant, two-house, 23-person cooperative, with ambitions of further expansion and development in the future.

By pooling our resources, we hope to minimize our costs of living and maximize the power behind our decisions as conscious consumers. We are a close-knit community dedicated to living out our ideals and values in our daily actions and interactions.

Our first house, &quot;The Zooo&quot;, is approximately two blocks from Northwestern University, and most of our members (in either house) are students there. However, we have no formal affiliation with the university, and we welcome undergraduate students, graduate students, non-students, students of life, and everyone else.

To learn more about our co-op, please visit our website or email us! Additionally, if our community interests you, please feel free to stop by for dinner sometime — both of our houses have several vegetarian/vegan communal dinners per week, and guests are always welcome.</description>

In addition to our eco-friendly lodgings, our volunteer and intern programs allow you to work with your Heart, doing creative work, with your Body doing physical work and with your Brain doing tech, writing and/or research!

In other words, you can enjoy a community oriented working and educational vacation in Hawaii at a much lower cost than a traditional tourist staying in a hotel.

As one of the few feminist oriented communities in the world we have a number of programs both on the property and with our EcoFeminist Entrepreneur websites, which work towards gender equality through a philosophy of female empowerment rather than victimization.

As a result, our community is increasingly popular with women and progressive men around the world!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/hedonisia-hawaii-sustainable-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/hedonisia-hawaii-sustainable-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hedonisia Hawaii is a sustainable community of volunteers, interns and eco-tourists from around the world. We are located in the rainforest region of the 'Big Island' of Hawaii. 

We define ourselves as an eco-feminist 'community of individuals'. So even though we are active on a number of feminist, social and environmental causes, visitors can enjoy a vacation at our community without even know about some of our community projects!

For travelers who wish to enjoy a socially progressive working vacation, Hedonisia Hawaii offers a Fair-Trade Volunteer Program as well as a Sustainable Community Manager Internship where you can learn by actually living in and helping to manage an ecotourist community in Hawaii!</description>

It’s on the ground floor and one of the smallest units in our community.  If interested, call or email us.  The price will be $280 to $290,000.

Our loving and vibrant community has been living together for six years.  We share meals, conversations, helping hands, babysitting, song circles and the joy of connection.  We are tucked into the edge of a ravine, within walking distance of downtown Olympia, but in a lovely older neighborhood.  

We are actively seeking new members. We recently completed our Phase II construction project, which expanded us from 11to 18 units.  The approximately 50 members will range in age from 1 to 81.  Many of the new units are sold, but several beautiful, energy efficient units are still available for sale.   Rentals are available periodically.

Our site is on Olympia's West Side, just 1.6 miles from downtown, and 6 blocks from the beloved Westside Olympia food coop. Part of our land is a green belt provided by a deep ravine sculpted by a year-round stream that enters Puget Sound several blocks away. We currently have a large vegetable garden and play areas for the kids. All of our homes surround a center Green where we gather to talk, walk our dogs, ride bikes and scooters, and enjoy the sunshine.

Our legal structure is a condominium with a Steering Board made up of two members from each of the working committees – Building and Grounds, Administration, and Community Life.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22029&quot;&gt;RanchHome - Your Farm and Ranch Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Holistic Freedom/Liberty Oriented Country Neighbors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ranchhome-your-farm-and-ranch-home/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ranchhome-your-farm-and-ranch-home/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are people gathering together to buy a larger piece of rural farmland to be divided for individual ownership. The location will be in east Tennessee. 

The goal is to get some land to have a home, raise a family, cultivate a garden, a farm, a ranch, some animals, or operate an ethical business. The hope is that the buyers will get along, in a spirit of community, with freedom, liberty, and personal responsibility on their own, individual piece of land. This freedom extends to their fence line, but has some limited restrictions to make for a good and healthy quality of life, which is family-friendly, with family values, and peace and respect for the neighbors. There will likely be some land or building for common use.

To join, one should be financially capable to purchase raw land, now or in the not too distant future. It requires either cash or having access to other credit not secured by the land. The minimum will probably cost at least $20,000 for 10 acres. It is possible lot sizes could be smaller and cheaper if zoning permits it.

Property will be purchased strictly within the laws of Tennessee, and with the assistance of professionals to assure good title for each owner.</description>

Our primary wish is to live in a place where our multigenerational neighbors know each other like an extended family. We wish to live among neighbors who want community support through the cycles of life, have a desire to simplify and live sustainably, and keep an active connection to larger community. We wish to live with neighbors who help us nurture our spiritual values and practices, whatever they may be. We wish to create a community accessible to those with a diversity of personal abilities.

We have been living in our new homes since October 2009!</description>

We host workshops and internships on earthen building and organic gardening and sustainable living skills.  We are open to having other people join us in this project or come out and share the land and start a project of their own.  We have been here since June 2008.  We are building sleeping spaces and the gardens, have solar electricity, community kitchen and bathrooms, chickens, a yoga-meditation space, etc.  Look at our website to find out more, and write to us if interested in short- or long-term stays.

Our project just recently changed direction, and we are open to the possibility of selling the land and project to good people who want to continue living in a responsible and ecological way.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22032&quot;&gt;Valle de Sensaciones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Temporary community and learning experiences.
An experimental field close to nature for Eros Laboratory, Permaculture, DIY construction, sustainable technologies and living in community.
Living creativity in sensual contact to nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/valle-de-sensaciones/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/valle-de-sensaciones/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Valle de Sensaciones (valley of sensations) is the prototype of an ecovillage laboratory, a place which enables the establishment of temporary communities to provide extraordinary experiences of communal living and learning.
It offers the infrastructure and the framework to allow groups of people to come together for training, inter-project research, inspiration, experimentation, development and creative output.

The focus of the project is the palpable integration of humans in nature, the artistic accomplishment of the educative infrastructure, as well as a habitat which supports building community and the creative expression of each individual.

This summer 2017, for the first time, Valle de Sensaciones is producing a sensational immersion into the lands of Eros. Together with world-renowned teachers, facilitators and guides of tantra, sexual shamanism, conscious sensuality, polyamory relationships, heart-connected, authentic and nature inspired intimate relations we present you two months of juicy adventures.

This is a play-time, this is an experimental adult playground, a laboratory of community turned on at heart, a tribal journey with erotic energies and life-force of creativity, two months of festivity with gods and goddesses. Find empowerment by living your full potential and celebrating life. Find a paradisiac place on Earth where human interactions are authentic, hot and soul nourishing.

Valle de Sensaciones also aims to be a place of inspiration and cooperation among creative people.  Here we are creating an artistic sustainable paradise. You can find an educational park, experience artistic tree houses or caves, take part in multiple workshops, and jump instantly into community life. The wide range of subjects, like permaculture, green building, eco-technology, LandArt, music, instrument-making, drumming, and shamanism, is merging into an experimental fusion of Nature, Art and Sustainability.  

The project is mainly dedicated to people and existing groups who want to experience this unique environment for a short period, even if we are open for new long-term members in the event that we get a special personal and professional resonance.

Our communal living is based on our community-mandala which consists of a game board as a tool to organize the tasks and responsibilities of the communal living. It enables a community to share these functions in a flowing, flexible, fair and holistic way. This tool was developed by the project and is offered on our website www.tooools.org.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22033&quot;&gt;North American Students of Cooperation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Umbrella Organization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/north-american-students-of-cooperation/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/north-american-students-of-cooperation/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
NASCO and its affiliated organizations—NASCO Properties (NP), NASCO Development Services, Lots in Common (LinC), and the Kagawa Fund—are the mechanisms of North American cooperators for fulfilling the principles of continuous expansion, education, and cooperation among cooperatives. Through education, networking, and direct development, these organizations ensure the continued strength and expansion of the movement.

Organized in 1968, NASCO focused on education and training, particularly the annual Cooperative Education and Training Institute. Today, NASCO provides specialized training conferences for new developers, staff and managers, emerging leaders, and our entire membership. NASCO also provides onsite training and evaluation services, an internship program, networking resources and events, and the voice for a growing segment of the cooperative movement.

Providing technical resources and direct development assistance for new and expanding cooperatives, NASCO Development Services was started in 1987 to reestablish the student cooperative movement's commitment to expansion.

NASCO Properties (NP) was created in 1988 as a property holding and management corporation to assist new student housing cooperatives with financing and management. Since then, NP has become an important development tool for student and community groups that want to start group equity co-ops but do not have access to sufficient resources. NP uses equity from buildings it owns to provide collateral and equity for these new groups. It also operates as a support network for its member co-ops, offering training and asset management assistance. In turn, these member co-ops form the governance structure fro NASCO Properties. As of October 2018, there are 16 properties owned by NP that are rented by eight leasing cooperatives in Austin, TX, Chicago, IL, Kalamazoo, MI, Buffalo, NY, Urbana, IL, Lawrence, KS, Athens, OH, and Providence, RI.

Lots in Common is a joint partnership between NASCO and Riverton Community Housing. Modeled after NASCO Properties, LinC exists to accelerate the pace of cooperative development by introducing a new player to the non-profit cooperative development arena. 

Named for the Japanese co-op visionary Toyohiko Kagawa, the Kagawa Fund provides pre-development financing assistance to fledgling co-ops.

Social change and personal transformation are central to our vision.

Chrysalis has two houses side-by-side in a wooded setting about 10 minutes’ drive from Washington, DC. The houses can handle eight to ten permanent residents comfortably, with plenty of room for each person to have both personal space and an office or studio if they wish. The common rooms can accommodate up to 50 people for events. The houses front on a large park, with miles of bike and hiking trails and unspoiled nature. Music is an important part of life at Chrysalis.At Chrysalis, each person is empowered to take initiative and create their own projects, healing the society while building a supportive web of intimate relationships that nurture inner transformation. We use many techniques, including sacred touch, non-violent communication, being in the moment, and more. Our goal is to love the world through loving oneself.

Chrysalis encourages members to follow their own vision in the context of a creative, supportive community; we find the ongoing cross-pollination of ideas, talents, and energy takes us to a higher and more productive level. Resident non-members and non-residents are also an important part of Chrysalis; we see our community as part of a much larger network.

We are especially looking for people who want to explore their own limits, both personally and productively, who like to be synergized by being around other creative and effective people, and who would enjoy living in an environment that is both challenging and supportive, that invites you to grow while affirming who and what you are.

We actively welcome people who are not members to live with us; we value the unique contribution each person has to make. We are less focused on long-term commitments, and more interested in the energy and ideas that our housemates have to offer in the present. We welcome those who would like to work and play and learn with us, whether it be &quot;for a day or a decade.&quot;</description>

Struggle Mountain is an intentional community that has existed since the 1960s. It was named by Joan Baez when she lived here. After renting for most of a decade, it was bought by the community in 1976.  This intentional community evolved out of the sixties' counterculture and, most particularly, nonviolence and the draft resistance movement.

This community will design and build a wonderful sense of place on a historic six acre family farm in southeast Longmont near the St. Vrain River greenbelt and Isaak Walton Park.  
*********************
An objective among the existing member, active families and adults who prefer healthy living practices, is to live independently among one-another in a supportive and thoughtful manner.  We all believe in developing a community that is oriented around the cultivation and harvesting of agricultural systems and developing systems of sustainability and efficiency.  These are some of the properties that fit within our idea cohousing:
•	Respecting the viewpoints of others
•	You don’t know how much you can give until you start giving
•	Sustainability &amp;amp; Healthy living practice
•	Energy efficiency and smart growth plans (micro &amp;amp; macro)
•	Participate with the greater community
•	Achieve an intelligent, strong and self-governing protocols for our community
*********************

*********************
Join us to create the neighborhood that fulfills not only your vision but vision of like-minded individuals: a community with neighbors you feel comfortable collaborating with, spacious gardens, open space for our families to enjoy, two acres of city open space, develop access points to miles of the city's biking &amp;amp; walking trail network, and so much more; there’s that much opportunity as long as you’re willing to work for it!
*********************
We are in the process of working out the Land Option Agreement with the executor to the Bohn Family. The Bohn Family would like to see a cohousing community developed on their historic family property.  We hope to conserve the beauty and rural nature of our site yet integrates a modern feel for today’s trends.  The existing neighborhood association has also warmed up to the existing cohousing members and the development.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22037&quot;&gt;Red Earth Farms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Eco-sustainable homesteading&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/red-earth-farms/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/red-earth-farms/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Red Earth Farms is a community of homesteads on autonomous leaseholds dedicated to developing sustainable lifestyle choices. Our guiding principle is, &quot;Love the land; love your neighbors.&quot; We enjoy our close relationship with the planet that sustains us. In our actions we endeavor to do to others as we would have them do to us. This means a support for cooperative projects and gift culture.

It also means we respect the diversity among us. We hope this freedom of implementation will result in a number of different models of sustainable systems. Though we encourage cooperation, it is rarely obligatory. Individuals, families, and income-sharing communities make decisions about their own leasehold, and everyone can participate in decisions affecting the wider Red Earth Farms community. The issues upon which we seek full community agreement are few.

Many of our members are aiming to generate a high percentage of our own food, as well as shelter, fuel, clothing, tools, and other essentials. Nonviolence, permaculture, feminism, independence, and our personal spiritual paths are important to us.

We are located on 76 acres of rolling hills, with six ponds, several wooded areas, and a small creek. We are on a gravel road less than a mile from Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage and about three miles from Sandhill Farm. We have neighborly relationships with these communities; we share gardening tips, potluck dinners, frisbee games, and other social gatherings. We are open to visitors and we welcome individuals, families, and those of nontraditional lifestyles. We have some availability for new incoming members and are particularly interested in self-motivated folks with a pioneering spirit and a desire to homestead in a community of like-minded neighbors.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22039&quot;&gt;CoFlats Stroud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Cohousing, consensus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/coflats-stroud/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/coflats-stroud/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;There are now 2 CoFlats Communities in Stroud
Coflats Lansdown and Coflats Sladbrook. They were both developed by the Cohousing Company, which devdeloped Springhill Cohousing in 2003.
 The first, Coflats Lansdown is an established retrofit cohousing community. All the units are within the main building of what was once a Unitarian Church, built in 1835. The common house, on two floors, is in the apse of the church.
The project was completed in 2007. Stroud is in the west of England and is the location of Springhill Cohousing, the first new-build cohousing in Britain. Stroud has four organic cafes, great shops, art venues, community assisted agriculture, and the only &quot;green&quot; town council and mayor.
Coflats Lansdown  consists of 14 self-contained units. The common house has a kitchen, dining area, and a laundry with two washing machines and a dryer. 
All residents are members of the car share club. It has two automatic Peugeot 107's for the exclusive use of Coflats. The car is very efficient and does about 60 mpg (imperial gallons, not US gallons!)
Coflats is a three-minute walk from the town centre, where there is 90-minute train service to London and local bus and train connections.
There is a sunny courtyard and garden with secure parking for 20 bicycles; each flat has a locker by the bicycle space.
Members make decisions by consensus. 
As at November 2008, there are two flats for sale--check the website for details.
Nearly all the residents happen to be over 50; this was not designed, that's just the age group that were attracted to Coflats. We are open to those of any age.
CoFlats Sladbrook was established in 2015 and was quickly fully occupied. The residents are mostly in their 20's and 30's, a different demographic to Coflats Lansdown and Springhill. 
There are 7 flats, each around 600- 800 sq ft. A large common house of 2,000 sq ft containing dining room, kitchen, sauna, guest room, laundry, gym and store rooms.
CoFlats Badbrook is the first retrofit of a Victorian building to achieve an Energy Performance Certification of 'A' for each flat.</description>

      <name>Intentional Communities Desk (ICD)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22040&quot;&gt;Intentional Communities Desk (ICD)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To foster links with intentional communities from around the world, in order to learn about their life styles and activities, to exchange information, opinions and ideas for mutual benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/international-communes-desk-icd/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/international-communes-desk-icd/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The ICD is a contact office between intentional communities of all kinds, all over the world. It is essentially a committee of members of different types of kibbutzim, working mainly on a voluntary basis. It meets every two months or so at Efal, the kibbutz seminar centre, near Tel Aviv. The core of its work is correspondence, usually in English or Hebrew. However, you are also invited to write to us in German, French, Spanish, Dutch, or Portuguese. We'll be able to translate your letter.

Though founded in 1976, for the past 28 years the ICD has issued an English-language, biannual journal CALL (Communities At Large Letter), and for the last ten years a Hebrew version, Kol. It contains articles, newspaper excerpts, opinions, notices, and various information culled from community publications from all over the world. CALL &amp;amp; Kol are papers about communities, for communities, and by communities. The editor is a member of an Israeli urban kibbutz. You can receive CALL free of charge, but a donation will be gratefully received, as will items for publication.

We have also set up a website devoted to the various forms of communal living around the world. You’re sure to find something of interest there! As the contents of our website and CALL indicate, the term &quot;commune&quot; in our name is for brevity-not for exclusiveness. It really means all forms of communal living.

Though originally geared to the big wide world, the ICD in recent years has become active on the Israeli scene, where there is a growing &quot;movement&quot; of urban communes. It has issued a series of four Hebrew booklets, “Communal Living Around the World.” (Your community may well appear in them!)

We are very interested to hear from you, about life in your own community, your ideology, aims, and your problems–if any. Through such mutual contact, we feel we can help one another by sharing our communal experiences. Any comments on our website or on CALL will be very welcome.</description>

Welcome to Sacred Sueños

Sacred Sueños is an intentional community on 90 hectares of beautiful but degraded land, located on a mountainside about a two hour hike from Vilcabamba, Ecuador. Our vision is to create possibilities for humanity to live within a functioning ecosystem.


In the past, the mountains between what is now Podocarpus National Park, and the town of Vilcabamba, in Southern Ecuador, were home to many people who grew their own food from the steep hillsides. Decades ago, however, the residents left their homes for the valley. The last few generations practiced unsustainable agricultural such as burning for cattle grazing.

Constant burning of the plants left the top soil more susceptible to erosion. Any soil that may have been left over lack in nutrients as there was no plants to decompose. Due to the lack of productivity, the steepness, and the two hour hike from Vilcabamba, no Ecuadorians wanted to live and work there. For these same reasons we decided to take the degraded mountainside and call it home, Sacred Sueños, in hopes to show that we could make it into a productive site, both for humans to live sustainably as well as to promote biodiversity and create a healthy, growing ecosystem. To achieve this we focus on permaculture and analog forestry practices while experimenting with and demonstrating means of: restoring soil fertility while enhancing resource production; building affordable natural housing; and developing appropriate technologies.

Currently, there are two projects on the land. The founding site is now called the Seed Camp, a small homestead, pioneered in June of 2004, on land so degraded by decades of unsustainable agricultural practices that nearly nothing could grow in the soil. Much has changed, with the dedicated help of volunteers and residents. Though it’s still a few years from full recovery, the land has now improved to the point of providing several nutritious gardens within an agroforest, as well as a recently planted orchard. Infrastructure has been constructed on this site to house eight to fifteen residents, generally visitors, volunteers, interns, and prospective members of the Sacred Sueños community. If you’re interested in a unique experience volunteering in Ecuador, this is where you would be living.


Another site, Wild Blossoms Farm, is located at the entrance to Sacred Sueños. It’s a demonstrative regenerative homestead, using a variety of animals (horses, goats, chickens, ducks, quail, and rabbits) and analog forestry techniques to create fertile garden beds within an edible forest. The aim is to create an example of a productive system that can sustain much of the needs of a small family, with high value surpluses, and an easy, comfortable, infrastructure.

Beyond these two projects, there are many other beautiful plots of land where people can manifest their own sacred dreams within the community’s vision. We look forward to growing into the future!</description>

The MacKenzie Heights Collective, formerly known as the King Edward House, has been a cooperative household for over 40 years in the Kitsilano/Dunbar neighbourhood of Vancouver, BC. We have been operating under the same basic principles of shared living since we were established. We share vegetarian meals, social gatherings, environmental consciousness, ideas and laughter. 

Each member of the community cooks one vegetarian dinner per week, and we rotate shopping and household chores. We buy our groceries primarily from local or organic suppliers.  Our shared meals are vegetarian, although individuals do on occasion eat meat within the house as a separate event from our shared dinners. We have hosted a variety of community gatherings including study groups, potlucks, music nights and occasional dance parties (hallowe'en, new years). 

Our large, character home has plenty of common spaces, hardwood floors, a fireplace, a cold cellar, and a great view of the mountains and city. We have created a front yard that contains many plants which are indigenous to the Cascadia Bioregion and large trees that shield our home from the road. The backyard has our vegetable/herb gardens, patio, shed/garage, and compost system.  We have excellent, quick bus service to UBC and downtown, as well as secure indoor bicycle storage.

Adelphi is an intentional community founded by the author of the book &quot;The Ultimate Frontier.&quot; It is a place for those people interested in the philosophy presented in that book to live and interact with others of like mind. The book gives an intelligent explanation of the mysteries of human existence, and provides a practical approach to spiritual growth. Many readers said it tied together the many pieces of their own philosophy they had already learned through living. The book's philosophy is centered on the idea that the purpose of life is personal growth in psychological and emotional maturity. The pursuit of ever-greater maturity is a continuous challenge with great rewards, and it is the ultimate frontier.
Learning about the community and becoming a member and resident begins with reading &quot;The Ultimate Frontier.&quot; Adelphi is a place where conscious, deliberate effort to achieve ever-greater maturity is our purpose, and members work to create a culture that supports that goal. Come live, learn, and grow with us.

By continually creating through unified consciousness, the community aligns in a single harmonic, while opening to the flow of infinite possibilities, inspiring individual and collective transformation, and creating pathways leading to profound universal peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/lifeseed/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/lifeseed/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTICIPATION: Lifeseed is an intentional community dedicated to the discovery and full expression of each individual's creative gifts. Located on 10+ acres, the community is evolving through the INsights of community participants, the Lifeseed Creative Process.  

Located on nearly 11 acres in southwest Colorado,  with great views, two large greenhouses, sweat lodge and many area activities.  We are near the ancient ruins of Mesa Verde, the canyons of Utah and Arizona, and the rivers and high mountain passes in Colorado. Less than a 1/2 hour outside of Durango. Community activities include hiking, bicycling, river rafting, music events, skiing &amp;amp; cross country skiing.

At this time we have reconfigured the property to meet the needs of the community and those coming by dividing the property into 3 lots for easy property ownership. One lot has a yurt with room to build, the second has a 2,5oo sq. ft. home with two living spaces and the third is ready to build. They have amazing sunrise/sunset views of the Native American Mt. Hesperus and Mesa Verde &amp;amp; Sleeping Ute Mountain.  This land hosts a high life-giving frequency vortex of powerful energy.  
 
This community will continue to unfold as participants share in the group meditative process: Lifeseed Creative Process.

Écohameau des Bernaches
Projet à développer en milieu rural pour tous ceux qui désirent vivre et travailler avec des gens, et ce dans l’entraide, en harmonie avec l’environnement. Cet éco-lieu réunira un ensemble de personnes ayant fait des choix de vie axés sur la simplicité, l’engagement, le respect de soi, des autres et de l’environnement, ceci rendant possible la coopération.

La création d’un écohameau est un très beau projet
…loin d’être utopique, particulièrement dans cette période où il semble y avoir un vent de conscience écologique qui s’élève. Ce type de projet sans participants convaincus n’est qu’un beau rêve. Pour la réalisation de ce projet, il est essentiel de réunir des participants matures psychologiquement, ayant développé ou étant en processus de développer des capacités relationnelles saines. Nul besoin d’être parfait, la bonne volonté, la bonne humeur, le désir d’apprendre avec les autres et de partager ses connaissances ainsi que l’authenticité doivent simplement être au rendez-vous.

Voici 7 capacités essentielles pour réussir un tel projet:
1- être capable de réflexion;
2- être capable d’introspection;
3- être capable d’écouter l’autre;
4- être capable de s’exprimer sainement;
5- être capable d’automotivation;
6- être capable de passer à l’action;
7- être en processus face au non-jugement.

Village Terraces is a neighborhood within Earthaven Ecovillage. Our vision is to create extended family and a deep connectedness to the earth, ourselves, and each other. As the first cohousing group at Earthaven, we are building and living densely in order to share resources, including extensive common space, facilities, and utilities. Of our envisioned four buildings we have built two, which house ten full members, two children, several interns, and a business selling medicinal herbs. We will eventually share the neighborhood with 24 to 30 adults plus children. 

The cohousing style provides “apartments” that can include private kitchenettes and baths, with the added benefit of shared common spaces such as a large common kitchen and bath, common gardens, orchards, and a pasture for dairy animals. We also have access to Earthaven’s Council Hall and other community facilities, as well as shared use of most of Earthaven’s 329 acres.

We share all of Earthaven's ecological and spirit-guided values and agreements. In addition, the following values are particularly important to us:

•	A desire to raise children together in a neighborhood and village context.
•	Honest and responsible communication with an active willingness to resolve conflicts in a healthy manner.
•	A commitment to consciously and lovingly raising both plants and animals for food.
•	Love and acceptance of ourselves, our bodies, and the cycles of life and death.
•	Cooperative living in common-walled buildings built with local materials.

To learn more about the process of joining Village Terraces, read our Initial Contact Letter on our website.

Joining Village Terraces Neighborhood means first becoming a member of Earthaven Ecovillage. Please explore the village through our website, a tour, and extended visits.

We (a healthy, older couple plus one foody/green housemate plus seasonal WWOOFers, volunteers and interns) are seeking conscious dialogue/visitation with one or two more (a healthy couple, perhaps?) highly motivated grower, community-conscious, foody comrades/partners/landmates for more-than-transient stewardship, gardening, infrastructure building, farm visioning, and potential farm transference within the decade. We've had two decades of success and fun with goat dairy, soil building, greenhouses, workshops, gardens, orchards, seed saving, flowers, etc. We share one large, ark-like home (needs more renovation/green retrofitting. NO other dwellings are possible). Looking for one or two highly motivated, competent, sober, green, permaculturally stoked friends (who only lack the right land) to explore the next level.

Residents of Camphill California are dedicated organic, biodynamic gardeners. During our long growing season, we produce more than one third of the fruits and vegetables that we consume from over seven acres of carefully tended land, including a small vineyard donated by Bonny Doon.

In addition to gardening, residents work in our weaving studio, crafting a variety of hand-woven items. Our culinary workshop is also a favorite workplace and produces products including  soothing herb tea and delicious culinary mixes.  Some Camphill residents even participate in supported employment programs.</description>

The Beaver Creek Homestead is no less than an attempt, likely futile, in starting society from scratch.

The goals are to develop:
1: Cyclical systems of food-waste-fertilizer-food
2: Methods of power generation and use such that no additional power is required from either the existing grid or internal combustion engine (ICE) generators.
3: Building techniques that use available resources as much as possible and passive heating and cooling.
4: Self-directed methods of education modeled on places like the Summerhill School that recognize the importance of individual choice.
5: An alternative to the current existing Capitalist economic system that is more effective at distributing resources based on effort and need rather than property ownership.
6: Alternative social structures and institutions that maximize individual liberty while maintaining social cohesion.  The community must be capable of having a place for everyone, from the cradle to the grave.  (Needs work!)

It is a daunting goal and not for the feint of heart.  There are numerous challenges to overcome.  Some of the larger of them are:

1: Climate:  This area has winter temps that range into the -30c range and can have anywhere from 3 to 6 months of snow coverage.  Summers can get to nearly 40C with humidity of 90%+.

2: Social:  Canada has a pretty conservative culture in general and does not welcome change or alternative viewpoints.  This area is no exception.  Additionally there is bound to be some upheaval and resistance when changing anything that has inertia behind it.

3: Economic:  This region is probably one of the poorest areas in North America economically.  There are very few opportunities locally and none that are very rewarding.  This makes the fact that even a limited dependence on the existing infrastructure becomes problematic.

What we require from potential members:

1: You not only think outside the box, but were born to live outside it.
2: You have expertise that will enable us to achieve one or more of the above goals.
3: Passion, Dedication and Self-Direction.  You have no trouble picking a task and seeing it through to completion.
4: A commitment to the scientific method.  You do not trust divine revelation or convention but rather practical, careful, testing.  You have a deep mistrust of superstition and embrace modern knowledge, without necessarily embracing all modern applications of that knowledge.

You like BIG challenges.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22056&quot;&gt;Kerala Commune&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; community environment action&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kerala-commune/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kerala-commune/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Kerala Commune is in Kerala, India. The commune is located in the valley below Malleswara Peak of the Neela Giri (blue mountain) range, on the bank of a beautiful freshwater river, the Bhavani. The mystic peak and unpolluted waters and air make the commune a pleasant, healthful place to live.

The commune was established by the end of 2004. Since the location is in the mountains, the weather is relatively cool even in the summer, without the scorching heat of the typical Kerala weather. Winter nights can be chilly. Monsoon rain starts in June and lasts till the end of October. The monsoon can be a windy, somewhat harsh downpour at times; however, those who love rain enjoy it. The local people are friendly; aggressive behaviour, theft, voyeurism, etc., from the local population have not so far been reported. 

About 400 people visit the commune every year. Most of them are from Kerala or from other parts of India. We do get visitors from abroad, from the USA, Germany, and Iceland.

Objectives of the commune:

The practice of gender equality; organic farming; preservation and conservation of environment; development of alternative energy resources; treatment of illnesses with fruits, vegetables and sprouts; language teaching; yoga; recycling and reuse; education of the local population in the fields of organic farming and natural pest controls; promotion of natural products; upholding of secular values; respect for the right to worship; rejection of corporate funding; rejection of racism. 

The commune land underwent an organic nutritional enhancement process for three years, and now we are planning on farming. Besides coconuts, we have seasonal mangoes, chakkas, and papayas.

A part of the commune treatment for illnesses is free of cost. The commune treats those from the lower strata of society and teaches them how to avoid dependence on drugs, the corporate drug industry, and the corporate hospital establishment. The commune has succeeded in treating and curing almost all kinds of illnesses, as well as infertility, without medicine. 

We conduct weekly meetings in which local people attend and discuss diverse subjects.

We eat a healthful diet: fresh coconut, banana, whole wheat or rice, fresh and cooked vegetables, and no coffee or tea (you can have them from the nearby restaurant if you need them). However, we are not fanatic about diet. For festivals like New Year’s, etc., we do eat fish and meat.

Omega House is a big beautiful home located south of downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. It has been an intentional community since 1968.

We are diverse in age and gender, and queer-friendly. Our home is often a gathering place for community events, and we like to be involved with our neighborhood.

In the summer we have a CSA share, and throughout the year we collectively buy food from our local coop. Omega manages the community garden located next door to the house, and residents are involved in taking care of the garden. We value living sustainably and many of us are particularly interested in sustainable agriculture and food justice.   We also own a Hobby Farm/Piece of forest land in northern wisconsin we retreat to for projects and bonding.

We operate according to flexible principles of consensus. Residents are expected to contribute financially, share maintenance responsibilities, and engage with the community through labor and regular meetings.

Residents have private bedrooms, and all other rooms and spaces are shared.

We embrace living sustainably on the earth, creating a beautiful place to live, continuing to grow, aging in community, and responsibly honoring our commitment to one another. We are committed to establishing a workable balance between having our own private lives, doing our share for Silver Sage Village, and reaching out to the wider community.”

In support of our vision, we embrace the following core values:

Compassion – we strive to more deeply understand and be open-hearted with each other, accepting ourselves and each other without judgment.
Generosity – we freely ask for what we need and strive to give freely what we can.
Respect – we honor and support the dignity and worth of each member of our community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/silver-sage-village-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/silver-sage-village-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Built on one acre adjacent to North Boulder's Holiday Neighborhood, Silver Sage is between 28th and Broadway, north of Yarmouth on 16th and Yellow Pine.

RiverRidge Intentional Community

When you were 20, did you ever think how you would be living when you were 60? I didn’t.

Has your concept of “living together” changed over time? Mine sure has. Is there a better way to live than how you are now living that could save money, provide companionship, provide opportunity for a true community, and preserve our natural resources?  

Golden Girls got me to thinking about cooperative housing. Obviously this is a way for everyone to spend less. Four people living in one house can live almost as cheaply as one!

I notice that we share resources for things like libraries, parks, water, roadways, and education, to name a few. Why not housing? The Europeans do it. We stay in our houses one by one or two by two because of a tradition of individual autonomy, choice, and control. I’ve decided those things are not as important to me as a higher quality of life—a shared, sustainable lifestyle.

 I grew up thinking how wonderful it would be to live in a shared housing situation with like-minded women who care and look out for each other.

For many of us, another primary purpose for sharing is social. We often live and work within minutes of hundreds of people without knowing their names, much less their life stories. It’s been proven that we live longer and healthier lives in a household with other residents. 

We often think of the financial or social benefits of cooperative housing, but what about the ecological benefits? Studies have shown that people who live in cohousing recycle more, moderate their use of electricity, and are less dependent on auto transportation for entertainment. Think of the savings alone from shared washers, dryers, freezers, and those loud growling lawnmowers. We could even impact urban development. Cooperative housing diminishes expensive outlays for new roads, schools, and water systems by curbing urban sprawl and encouraging redevelopment of inner cities and suburbs. This is just one of the easiest ways to conserve on all sorts of resources big and small.

Isn’t it time for all of us to consider cooperative living?

TerraVie is a qualified recipient for an ecological gift, certified by the Minister of the Environment of Quebec.
 
TerraVie is devoted to scrupulously managing the land at their disposition in conformity with its charter and principles. TerraVie is committed to preserve its objectives, irrespective of the socioeconomic or political context. 

This initiative is based on the principle that land is not a commodity, but a fundamental resource to be maintained for the community as a whole.

Although land trusts are established for similar reasons, TerraVie is different in that its purpose also includes the development of viable ecological communities.

It acts as a local, sustainable, environmentally conscious stimulator while educating the public about the various aspects of lifestyles in harmony with nature. It emphasizes the development of communities that minimize the exploitation of resources and financial speculation on land.

In Laurentides at Montcalm, TerraVie purchased on September 5, 2006, 250 acres of land with a lake (40 acres) and two downstream rapids.

On September 5, 2006, TerraVie purchased 288 acres of land near the hamlet of Moncalm in the Laurentian Mountains north of Montreal. The mainly forested land has access to a lake and two rapid flowing streams.

TerraVie rents part of the land (25 %) to two nonprofit cooperatives (housing and employment) that manage the activities of the ecovillage. The cooperatives are responsible for the buildings, but cannot own the land or the natural resources. They are obliged to ensure the ecological integrity of all activities and construction within their territory. The cooperatives must respect the ecological charter and fundamental principles of TerraVie as described on our website.

The board and members of TerraVie are working towards the creation of a legal structure to facilitate the establishment of community land trusts (CLTs) and ecovillages throughout Quebec. The research studies that stem from this project will be made available to the general public.

TerraVie received the ¨Phoenix of the Environment 2007&quot; award in the categorie “sustainable development” for its pilot project at Montcalm. This prize is the highest distinction from the minister of environment of Quebec.</description>

This is a place that is a joy to return to, supportive of our lives, work, and service, a foundation for friendships, filled with laughter, music, art, yummy food, responsive to, and supportive of life's challenges, respectful of diversity, earth friendly, and a strong contributing household to the Sunward Community.

We recognize that cooperative living is an ever-evolving work in progress. Miscommunication is bound to happen. Tempers will flare. Feelings will be hurt. And most of the time the collective effort of creating a sense of place, a community, will lift our spirits and make us feel all warm and fuzzy inside. We acknowledge the minefield and we enjoy the dance together as we move through it. To this end, house participation, being social, and doing chores are important priorities. 

AND YOU? We are open to chatting with folks about possibilities. This would include someone who:

• Will make our house better than without you
• Is passionate about dancing
• Is excited about cooperative living
• Follows an ecologically sustainable lifestyle
• Will say what you mean and do what you say
• Is responsible, fun loving, emotionally mature, and financially stable
• Likes to eat and cook healthy organic food for a group
• Keeps a very clean and tidy house and kitchen
• Likes to live without TV
• Doesn't use tobacco, artificial scents, or have a furry pet
• is enthused to be part of our community

Ours is one of 40 households comprising Sunward Cohousing, an intentional community where resources are shared, lives are simplified, the Earth is respected, diversity is welcomed, children play together in safety, and living in community comes naturally. We are located about 4 miles west of downtown Ann Arbor on 20 beautiful acres including woods, ponds, organic gardens, playfields, an antique barn, and more.</description>

Because this is a planned day of community work activities, if you would like to come, it is essential that you contact our Works Coordinator Jeremy (jeremy@shub.info) in advance.

It is sometimes possible for international and interstate visitors to stay at Moora Moora to make their visit more relaxed. To enquire about this, please send an e-mail to info@mooramoora.org.au.

BECOMING A MEMBER

The process of becoming a member of Moora Moora involves a number of steps and takes between six months and two years. We encourage potential members to visit regularly to allow a deeper understanding of the various aspects of the community. 

Those interested in pursing membership become a Friend of Moora Moora, with a payment of a $200 interest-free refundable loan which supports the community. They are encouraged to attend our Co-op Workdays, Directors’ and Community Meetings, our weekly café and social events and to participate in cluster workdays. Such participation is essential in getting to know Moora Moora and our people and to become known in turn. 

After this, a Friend may apply to become a non-member resident, if accommodation is available. Living in a cluster as a non-member resident provides a trial in experiencing life as a member of our intentional community, with all the advantages, obligations and at times difficulties that ensue. 

Ultimately, the non-member resident may nominate for membership, a process which takes some months and ensures the Friend is a good fit for Moora Moora.

FINANCIAL COMMITMENT

Each member of Moora Moora holds a separate shareholding in the co-operative and has a separate financial/economic obligation to the community. 

Members sharing houses are required to have one basic shareholding. Individual members living in a house to themselves are required to have one and a half basic shareholdings. 

The cost of a basic shareholding is around $17,500 (as at Dec 2015), an amount which is indexed and increases each quarter. Quarterly payments of around $400 are required to cover maintenance and other costs of running the community. 

In addition to this, members will need to buy a home. (See http://mooramoora.org.au/membership-97236/houses-for-sale). 

Members are required to contribute a minimum of 60 hours of labour a year, but members can expect to have to spend four or more hours a week in various community activities.

RUNNING THE CO-OP

Moora Moora is a registered co-operative and operates under the Co-operatives National Law. Business meetings of the community are held monthly and are open to members, non-member residents, Friends and sometimes visitors. 

Decisions are made by consensus of those members present. The co-op is administered on a day-to-day basis by seven directors, together with a number of committees (eg Works, Land, Finance, Membership). 

The co-op appoints members to roles as co-ordinators or managers, who implement committee decisions. Positions include works co-ordinator, land manager and treasurer.</description>

There are 75 adult members, building our own new community in a model which is perhaps best described as an urban kibbutz of groups. The age range amongst our members here is from 30 to 45. There are 75 children. We currently reside all under one roof - an 8 storeyed former absorption center.</description>

Founded in 1999, Millstone Co-op is a community of 11 people living and working in Somerville (and the broader Metro area) to make our corner of the world a better place to be. We also strive to make our house a positive, supportive and fun place to call home.

At Millstone, we share chores and other responsibilities, as well as many of our meals. House members prepare and serve vegetarian dinners three times per week, and guests and friends are always welcome for dinner or for one of our community brunches. We value local community, social justice, diversity, and environmental sustainability, and we try to make choices in what we buy, eat, and do that reflect these values. We also make decisions by consensus and place an emphasis on open communication.

Individually or as a house, we love to grow things indoors and out; we love making, listening to, and dancing to music; we get involved in local and national politics; we get addicted to really good TV series on DVD (e.g. The Office, Lost, and Project Runway); we brew, bake and can; we read the local free papers and national news blogs (and sometimes juicy tabloids); we go to drag shows, karaoke nights, salsa dances, and bluegrass concerts; we frequent bars and libraries; and mostly if you're into something we're all ears (and eyes, hands, feet, etc.)!

“Komaja” means “radiant love.” It describes a spiritual-philosophical system, as well as an international spiritual community, founded in 1978 by the well-known tantric master Aba Aziz Makaja. Komaja offers a deep and nondogmatic access to spirituality with a complete system of spiritual schooling.

Komaja is a specific form of tantric kundalini yoga, developed by Makaja who, as spiritual master, is at the core of Komaja’s life and its development. Knowledge is Komaja’s connecting spiritual thread, radiant love its principal virtue. The seven main activities of the community are meditation, theoretical studies, development of community consciousness, karma yoga, spiritualization of sexuality (via asceticism or by being sexually active; original methods of realization are given for both paths), spiritual singing, and spiritual sport.

Today Komaja has more than 300 members and many friends who draw inspiration from its model of living. They live all over Europe, Australia, and in North America. Makaja and his community are socially involved in many countries, with humanitarian and ecological activities, scientific and educational/therapeutical activities, etc. Komaja is member of the World Association for Sexology; Komaja’s Love-Erotic Therapy (LET), for overcoming different kinds of addictions, is privately and state financed. Komaja is an example of how new forms of intimate relationships can be lived successfully: many people practice the zajedna, an original form of polyamory.

We are a forming community. We intend to grow much of the food we'll enjoy, to work cooperatively, and make decisions by consensus.

We currently meet online using Yahoo IM. Contact Dan for more information. 

We'll honor the essence of religion by providing a place where we'll share each other's paths. 

We will provide for ourselves through community projects, such as creating retreat space, growing herbal and medicinal plants for marketing or other onsite or mail order enterprises. These would not preclude individual cottage industries or smaller group projects or programs that would enhance the viability of our community.

We will explore right livelihood, and peaceful existence, and reach out to the greater community and world to provide what we can to help others in whatever way we come to feel meets the community's ability and desires.

Drumlin Co-op is a 91-unit housing cooperative located in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. Brantford is located centrally in southwestern Ontario, about an hour's drive from Toronto and London, and about three hours from the borders at either Windsor or Fort Erie. 

Drumlin was first established in September 1988 and first occupied in 1989. The co-op consists of two-, three-, and four-bedroom units, as well as five accessible units. There is a community centre and office located centrally on the co-op grounds that houses laundry, maintenance and storage facilities, along with the office. There are two staff persons available four days per week. 

Co-ops are one of four kinds of nonprofit housing. They are the only nonprofit housing that is democratically managed by the residents. The premise behind cooperative housing is to provide an affordable housing alternative for people that allows them to have some control over how their community is run.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22074&quot;&gt;Falconblanco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Rising awareness, self healing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/falconblanco/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/falconblanco/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
FalconBlanco, (established 1975), is situated in the middle of the Island Ibiza, Spain. We give to volunteers from all over the world the possibility to work together, firstly, with the intention to raise awareness individually and as a group. This is part of our work and our main goal. This happens in the frame of daily work with our various projects and to maintain the place and take care of people, animals, and plants. 

We are providing information for all who are searching for a creative way to get out of ones suffering when realizing, that one is stuck in a strait jacket of a common mindset... We give information that can serve as a *key* for people who are asking for it. We are distributing videos, e-books  and printed information worldwide about an effective stress release exercise, to further awareness, growth, and health. We investigate alternative and holistic ways to heal oneself and further self-responsibility to get out of dependencies. We are using various means for this and offer at our website articles, answers to questions, discussions, and downloadable e-books, videos and tapes. We are printing booklets and leaflets. This is done by permanent members and volunteers of FalconBlanco. All offered services are free; money is never involved. All volunteers are doing their work because they are motivated and engaged in our projects. With our actions we intend to start a “positive chain reaction.” Helping our fellow human beings who are in need, wherever this is showing up, without expecting any reward. Money never is a motive for our doing. Then we can have the surprising experience that the more we give, the more comes back. And with this we are rising to another level, beyond the narrow level of ones 'personality' that is bound and limited to materialistic behavior and thinking. This is not a project or a dream, this is what we are living at FalconBlanco. 

Of course we have to deal with all the personal problems people carry with them when coming to live here. Our common goal is to be of help to others, and to get out of worn out habits and mindsets, to go beyond our established personalities. This is hard work and only a few people are capable for it, so we are in need of members who are not afraid to confront themselves and so are able to share our intention. 
We are in transition and are open now for new members. - Although we have learned to be critical about people who want to share our life.</description>

We also have eight associate members who live outside of GGC, some of whom participate very regularly in our activities.  We meet Fridays for a meal together and monthly for business.

In addition to meals and meetings, we also gather together to share happy and sad events in our lives, celebrate holidays, and hold movie nights and game nights. We have work-parties to accomplish larger community tasks, and garden together.

We are a retrofit or infill type of cohousing project, using existing houses in the neighborhood to create our intentional community. We have friendly relations with most of our immediate neighbors, some of whom participate in some activities with us.  Currently fourteen houses within our boundary are owned by members of Genesee Garden Cohousing.  Some of these houses are still in the process of major renovation.  

We are looking for new members! There are houses for sale nearby that, once purchased, could be included as part of Genesee Garden Cohousing. There are also options for renting, both within Genesee Gardens Cohousing and in the immediate neighborhood.</description>

Areas of focus: permaculture, ecovillage, Non-Violent Communication, consensus, growing food, sustainability, harmony, diversity and social justice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/port-townsend-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/port-townsend-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Do you want to walk, bike or bus to beaches, a food co-op, and the heart of a cultural and historic small town?  Do you want to live in a community of people dedicated to living in harmony with each other and with the earth?  

We are a small-town, multigenerational EcoVillage on 7.5 acres in Port Townsend, WA, a historic seaport of 10,000 residents. We have a core group of a 35 active participants: 25 adults and 8 children, live on site.  We are flourishing and still growing with the families who joined us this past summer and the spaces that are available for more people to join.

Currently (January 2018) there is a 4-BR home for sale on one of the twelve 4,000 square-foot lots.  Asking price $399K.  There is also one undeveloped lot available for sale/homebuilding for $110K, which could be shared among two owners. A leased site for a tiny house is available for $300/month.

The house for sale is south facing &amp;amp; energy-efficient, has foot thick sculpted walls and decorative tree bodies, a “cook’s” kitchen, and a spacious entry room.  Contact us for more information.

Purchase of both the undeveloped lot and house for sale includes ownership of 1/12th of 7-acres of common land/buildings with many amenities, including a large home whose rental income keeps our assessments currently at zero.

We have rental units that occasionally open up for new occupants. 

Residents share ample common gardens, fields, woods, a large 3,600 square foot shop/art/recreation center. We have extensive food gardens, and are currently designing a common house we hope to begin building in 2018. We plan to use 3 acres of our best land to grow food using permaculture, restorative agriculture principles, and other organic methods, and may develop cottage industries. We embrace and seek diversity and especially welcome families with children.

We share once or twice weekly meals and celebrate solstice and other diverse earth and life cycle days together.  Fun and connecting activities happen often - recent examples:  crafting weekend, hula-hooping, storytelling gathering, gifting circle, food preserving.
  
Structured as a Home Owners Association, our members own their own lots and the homes they build on them, and thus have access to mortgages, federal tax deductions and tax credits for renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives.  HOA members collectively own a large 2-kitchen home with 4 bedrooms and one of the lots on which there are 3 rental spots for Tiny Houses, one still available. In 2017 one lot was developed with a duplex for affordable family rental housing.

The available lot costs $110,000. This does not include the cost of a dwelling, but does include one twelfth ownership of common land and buildings.

We offer tours once a month prior to our monthly community meeting on the second Sunday of each month, and can sometimes arrange for a tour on another date. Call us to arrange a visit!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22079&quot;&gt;700th Millennium Community (formerly 7th Millennium Community)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To establish the self-reliant, self-sufficient, self-sustainable communes, cooperatives &amp;amp; ecological villages in the logistic, safe &amp;amp; strategic environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/7th-millennium-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/7th-millennium-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
     The 700th (formerly 7th) Millennium Community is the proposed self-reliant, self-sufficient, self-sustainable cooperative composed of a Christian or Messianic camp, beach resort, conference &amp;amp; retreat center, retirement complex, kibbutz, guided tour, with some cottage industries, enterprises, &amp;amp; general consulting services.  The Christians, Messianic, other believers &amp;amp; followers ought to be the creators of jobs &amp;amp; suppliers of the goods &amp;amp; services, rather than mere employees &amp;amp;  consumers.  They ought to be working for the Creator, Elohim, YHVH &amp;amp;/or Christ rather than for the cartel or monopolistic groups, credit, market, material-oriented &amp;amp; for the &quot;front&quot; churches, clubs, companies, establishments, industries, institutions, missions, NGOs, societies, &amp;amp; others.

     First, we are going back to the earliest Messianic era by emulating most of the living &amp;amp; working practices of the original New Testament Church (Acts 2:44-45; 4:32-35).

     Second, we are going to emulate the excellent examples on the self-sustainable communes, communities of the Mennonites, Hutterian Brethren, Amish, Bruderhof, Noiva do Cordeiro, 12 Tribes Community, &amp;amp; few other intentional communities that are religious, secular, ecological, &amp;amp; sustainable villages.  We are also hoping to follow the successful kibbutzim in Israel.

     Third, we are striving to live our daily lives in preparation for our Messiah’s second coming or Utopia whether it occurs in the next 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 years, or beyond!  
 
     Conceived as the ideal solutions to the problems of the Sabbath-observing, Christians, Messianic, other believers &amp;amp; followers, we in the 700th Millennium Community will pursue the establishment of the self-reliant, self-sufficient or sustainable cooperative so as to provide an alternative homeland to live in for safety, security, ideal retirement living.  To create job opportunities for our fellow &amp;amp; would-be Christians, Messianic, other  leaders &amp;amp; followers:  students, graduates, underemployed &amp;amp; unemployed persons who are interested to search for, to know &amp;amp; understand the general truths, &amp;amp; apply them in their lives.  To seek associations, fellowships, &amp;amp; partnerships with similar intentional communities in other countries, &amp;amp; be their mission, outreach partners in the Philippines according to His will.  The proposed sites would be somewhere in Southern Leyte &amp;amp; other provinces in the Philippines, or when our Creator or Provider opens the doors.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Kingdom of Elohim on Earth&lt;/a&gt;: The original New Testament Church applied the self-sustainable lifestyle, as clearly described in Acts 2:44-45; 4:32-35, which some of the religious, secular groups &amp;amp; individuals globally have been practicing from several decades to over 4.9 centuries.  The unfortunate poor persons in the churches, congregations, assemblies, charismatic movements &amp;amp; other religious organizations need to send &quot;a note to God&quot; to ask Him so that the millionaires, billionaires, wealthy &amp;amp; blessed Christian, Messianic members &amp;amp; other worshipers would act on and apply His words.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;How to Build Inexpensive Homes or Shelters&lt;/a&gt;:
Millions to billions of the people have the freedom, liberty &amp;amp; option to build the inexpensive homes or shelters. They can chose to follow the self-sufficient, self-sustainable lifestyles of the original Body of Yahshua or Christ that started on the Day of Pentecost in Jerusalem about 2,000 years ago!&lt;/li&gt;

This distinctive condominium cohousing neighborhood near Bremerton, Washington, offers quality reasonably-priced living an hour away by ferry from Seattle.
 
Meadow Wood is reminiscent of a New England village, nestled in a gently sloping pasture, bordered by a creek, surrounded by tall trees and nature trails. Yet it is located on a bus line and is less than 10 minutes from the Bremerton and Silverdale urban centers.

The layout of the site balances a desire for personal privacy with the social dynamics of a friendly, inter-generational community. We’re dedicated to bringing out the best in each other, through active listening, mutual respect, an appreciation of differences, and honest caring. Community decisions are made by consensus. There is no single leader, no pooled income, or other required communal practices. Residents either own their units, or rent from others who do. We are committed to an equitable stewardship of the land and resources, with a commitment to uphold the dignity of each person.

--enrich our lives and refresh our spirits through connection and cooperation
--meet economic and environmental challenges with creativity and resilience
--share the power of community to cultivate social and ecological sustainability within CoHo, the broader community, and the world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/coho-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/coho-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Coho Ecovillage is a 34-unit cohousing community, a mile and a half from downtown Corvallis, and close to public transportation and numerous bike and walking paths. Clustered on 6.8 acres and surrounded by trees and meadows, the units are a mix of flats and townhouses, all designed to support friendly interactions between neighbors. A large common house with a unique solar art installation is the gathering place for meetings, vegetarian meals, and recreational activities. 

Members of Coho Ecovillage are committed to living lightly on the land, embracing diversity and sharing with one another in mutual trust, respect, and support. All learn to listen carefully, use nonviolent communication, and make decisions by consensus.

Since moving into our community beginning October 2007, and we've been busy doing landscaping, building compost piles, planting gardens and an orchard, and getting to know each other better.  

Our residents range in age from infants to grandparents--currently there are 105 folks in our community (two thirds live on-site; one-third who live off-site are Friends of CoHo, Associate Members, or Non-Resident owners).  The overall adult to kid balance is about 3 to 1. We are a mix of income levels, abilities, and family composition. Twenty-six of our 34 townhouses and flats are handicap visitable, and all downstairs flats meet ADA-accessibility standards.

If you are interested, visit our website and/or come for a tour. We would love to hear from you.

Our building is a gut rehab of an abandoned 1950s-era office building in a formerly scruffy part of downtown Silver Spring. The building incorporates a number of green building features (ground-source heat-pump system, high-efficiency central hot water, etc.), and is LEED Silver certified.

EVC is legally structured as condominiums. Units range from one-bedroom flats to three-bedroom lofts.</description>

GaiaYoga Gardens (of Earthly Delights) is holistic cultural experiment,  permaculture homestead, and intentional community on Hawaii’s Big Island.  The vision we are manifesting is expressed in the book True Human Freedom:  The Inspiration and Argument for GaiaYoga Culture, by Ano Tarletz Hanamana.  We’re dedicated to living in harmony with the Earth, connecting with Spirit, engaging personal growth and healing, fostering cooperative community, and developing holistic and sustainable life patterns. We practice and teach Permaculture and other sustainable food systems, Nonviolent Communication (NVC), natural raw diet (Instinctive Eating and The Primal Diet), Light on Shadow (Shadow Work) connection parenting, cooperative living, and holistic and shamanic spirituality.  

Our lifestyle includes:
1) Living simply, sustainably, and close to nature - rurally and off-grid in low-impact eco-dwellings; growing food; operating eco-businesses; and trading for goods and services.
2) Cultivating a healthy self through eating a raw &amp;amp; organic diet; having an active work/service life; engaging personal growth work; balancing autonomy and interdependence; having a life-affirming orientation toward sexuality (this includes, but does not require, polyamory/polyfidelity); and being clothing-optional.
3) Establishing a land-sharing community that's intimate, caring, and feels like family. This includes practicing cooperative decision making, nonviolent communication; cooperating relative to resources and land development; having community businesses; sharing childrearing; and having fun together!
4) Integrating spirituality into our communal life through morning circles, prayer, hatha yoga, rituals, shamanic journeying, rites of passage, and spiritual study, all according to individual preferences.
Our dream is for GaiaYoga Gardens to be a beacon of light and love and a living example of the kind of world we want.

Walnut Street Co-op is a social change oriented cooperative household in Eugene, Oregon. In September 2000 we moved into a large, rambling house together, seeking to build community. Three years later we formed a legal co-op, funding the project with many small loans from like-minded individuals. As housemates, we eat dinner together, share chores, attend house meetings and work parties, and have a basic commitment to resolve conflicts. We trust that each person holds a piece of the truth, and we are committed to deep listening with each other. Over time we’re finding that our friendships are deepening and a shared vision is emerging based on creating shifts in society toward dialogue, deliberation, and integration of diverse viewpoints.

Mission Statement of the Association of Camphill Communities*
The Camphill movement, which was founded in 1940, works to create communities in which vulnerable children and adults, many with learning disabilities, can live, learn and work with others in healthy social relationships based on mutual care and respect. Camphill is inspired by Christian-based ideals as articulated by Rudolf Steiner, and is based on the acceptance of the spiritual uniqueness of each human being, regardless of disability or religious or racial background.

Although we are in a business partnership together, we also have strong social connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/new-brighton-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/new-brighton-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;New Brighton Cohousing is an owner-occupied townhouse community, located at 6010-6034 Soquel Drive in Aptos, California, less than one mile from the beach. It was formed out of the umbrella organization Santa Cruz Cohousing and was established in the fall of 2007. 

Currently we are a community of 19 adult members, three children, four cats and three dogs. About half the community works or has worked in social services and the other half in education, the sciences, medicine, and planning. Our ages range from 2 to 81. We enjoy each other's company and share a common interest in living more sustainably. 

The property consists of 11 individually owned 2-story townhomes in 3 buildings, and  one 1600-square-foot two-bedroom, two-bathroom  house, all situated around a central courtyard. We use the house as our common house, with kitchen, indoor and outdoor dining areas, a children's room, and guest room.

Community amenities include two group meals per week, a guest room, dining and meeting space, indoor and outdoor children's play areas, common garden and orchard. 

Our community is designed, owned, and managed by the residents. Membership requires participation in meal preparation once a month, active participation on a committee and an affinity group as well as participation in quarterly community-wide work parties. As much as possible, we do the maintenance and upkeep of the property ourselves.</description>

Yulupa Cohousing is a 29-unit urban-infill cohousing community in Santa Rosa, California, an hour north of San Francisco in Sonoma County. We moved in in July 2005. We frequently have turnover, so contact us if you're looking to buy or rent in this area. (Units include studios, one, two and three bedrooms, and one large four-bedroom high rise unit!).

We are a diverse, intergenerational community. Excerpts from our Vision and Values include, “Our community's spirit grows out of profound respect for the natural world and our human connection to it… We seek to provide mutual support, inspiration, warmth, and openness to each member in a way that nourishes many generations.” Other values include diversity, acceptance, privacy, learning, growth and innovation, communication, and environmental and ecologic consciousness.

This was a developer-driven cohousing development with Michael Black, architect, who has designed two other cohousing communities in northern California. This is his most colorful, playful, and innovative design.

Common areas include a large common house with kitchen, dining room/multipurpose room, kids’ room, laundry room, and lounge. Also on the property are a guest room, exercise room and a workshop. A garden area is on site, and people sign up to claim a plot.

We strive to live in ways that nourish the spirit of community, yet respect the individual needs for privacy.  
We seek to: reflect diversity; to honor our connections to the land and locale; to make decisions in general by consensus; to negotiate differences in a principled fashion; and to share the daily and weekly work of keeping things going. 
We believe that the creation of this community is a process that is evolving and will continually evolve as we grow and learn from one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/village-cohousing-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/village-cohousing-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Village Cohousing Community is an urban infill community, built on a half city block in Madison, Wisconsin.

There are 20 houses and 15 apartments, and of course a large common house (2500 square feet). The two-acre site is very close to the centre of Stroud, a town of 25,000 with a Green mayor and four organic cafes. The train station is a short walk away; it is a 90-minute trip by train to London.

The project was 80% pre-sold even before legal completion (ownership) of the site and before building permission had been granted.

Building work was done in phases, starting in 2003, and was 98% complete by February 2005. The last residents have now moved in and the first house is for re-sale.

We used a £4M facility from the Coop Bank to pay for the building phase.

The Common House is on three stories. 

There are five regular shared meals in the common house. All meals are vegetarian organic.

We are committed to consensus decision-making and have undertaken DIY (do it yourself) training. We have an under-used Disputes Committee as well as a buddy system for resolving conflicts. Most residents have been working together on the project for at least three years.

We have the largest Solar PV generator on private housing in Britain (49 kWp), newspaper insulation, triple glazing, car share, composting, recycling, etc.

Our location, active community, affordable homes and beautiful native landscaping make Stone Curves a highly desirable cohousing community. Our homes are connected by a lovely circuitous tree-lined path where children scooter, and neighbors walk and talk. For the physically active, we are a quick 10-15 minutes drive to the Catalina Mountains, where hikers can access 100+ miles of trails for day hikes or backpacking trips. The Rillito River Path is 1/2 mile away where bicyclists, joggers and walkers enjoy accessing 130 miles of a non-motorized shared-use path. Within walking distance we have several grocery stores, shops and restaurants. We are also located on a transit/bus line that takes you the four miles to Downtown Tucson. Tucson, with its progressive politics, boasts three cohousing communities. One-half mile to our East is Sonora Cohousing and 4 miles to our West is Milagro Cohousing. 

Our community amenities include a large lawn for playing, a flock of chickens, a large community garden with 23 beds, a citrus grove, a treehouse, and playground. Our large 3,850 square foot common house has 16 rooms for all activities. The three guest bedrooms, teen room, exercise room, library, office, living room, laundry room, kitchen, dining room, and tot room surround a outdoor courtyard. Off to the side of our dining room is our outdoor gas grill and picnic tables. Accessible next to the common house is the children's playground, pool and spa. Behind the common house is our compost area, citrus grove (fed by grey water system) and 800 square foot workshop.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22096&quot;&gt;Roberts Creek Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; OUR VALUES: 
•	Decisions will be made by consensus. 
•	Diversity will be encouraged with respect for and celebration of differences. 
•	Pets will be permitted as long as there is a limited number and owners are considerate to the community and the impact on the property. 
•	The community will be environmentally friendly by not using chemical fertilizers, pesticides, chemical cleaning products, wood stoves or dirt bikes. 
•	Priorities include diversity, respect, safety, health, aesthetics, friendship, quiet and peace.
 
OUR VISION: 
•	To work together to create a multi-generational community of varying race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, ability and financial status where residents as well as the natural environment will thrive.
 
OUR INTENTION:

•	To support each other, share resources and strive to be stewards of the land and live in harmony with the larger community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/roberts-creek-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/roberts-creek-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Roberts Creek Cohousing is the first purposely built, rural cohousing community in Canada. After five and one half years of plotting, planning, sweat, tears and approximately five hundred meetings, we began construction in late 2003. All 31 homes were occupied by December 2004.   

Our community is home to a rich diversity of adults and children from Canada and elsewhere (USA, U.K.,  with children from Guatemala and Kazakhstan). Currently we have approx. 50 adults ranging in age from 18 - 83 and 16 children.
 
Our site is 20 acres, with the buildings occupying 9 acres. The houses are mostly single-family homes with some duplexes.  We share a small community garden, woodworking shop and space for teens, small ceramic studio and exercise equipment. 

We have a large common house that is central to the physical and emotional heart of our community.  Since the common house was finished in June 2005, we have been sharing regular community dinners together (twice a week so far). 

Now that the hardware is in place we are beginning to focus more on the work of creating honest and authentic connection.  It's not always easy, however most members are committed to learning. Our most recent learning was a workshop with Diana Leafe Christian.  

Our other main focus is to generally have a good time.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22097&quot;&gt;Pacific Gardens Cohousing Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are an inclusive community focused on social action and a connection to nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/pacific-gardens-cohousing-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/pacific-gardens-cohousing-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Pacific Gardens completed construction in September, 2009. One unit is still available for sale.

We have 4.37 acres on the Chase River in Nanaimo, Vancouver Island, British Columbia. With a view of Mount Benson (and sunsets), the property is a delightful piece of country in the city covered with trees, a heritage orchard, seasonal pond and wildflowers. 

Our 25-unit building is designed to maximize green space and provide the best opportunities for social interaction. Our common house includes a kitchen, dining room, lounge, office, children's playroom, craft room, woodworking shop, exercise room and soundproof room for music practice, plus two guest rooms.

Each unit is self-contained with its own kitchen and individually-owned (strata-titled condominium), and includes shared ownership of the land and common amenities. They range in size from one-bedroom to three-bedroom-and-den. 

We currently have one three-bedroom-and-den unit for sale at $409,000 CAD. However, we may also have other units available in the future, so please contact us to find out if we have a home that's right for you. 

Although we are located in the city, Pacific Gardens is a haven of serenity. Down by the river in the forest of fir trees, you can imagine yourself far away from civilization; yet we are within a block of the bus and are minutes by car or cycle from downtown and local shopping. An elementary school, a high school, and Vancouver Island University are within walking distance.

Pacific Gardens Cohousing is committed to using non-toxic products, is non-smoking and scent-free, and has been built to the LEEDS gold standard.

The community is multigenerational and inclusive of all people who genuinely care about living in harmony with the Earth and each other.

We are a mixed-income, multigenerational, urban cohousing condominium within walking distance to public transportation, that is committed to being in attunement with its urban setting. As part of that commitment we maintain a system of ride sharing, subsidized MBTA fare passes, and community bicycles. We use a modified consensus process to make decisions and are committed to resolving conflicts through honest, direct, and respectful communication. 

Four hours of member work per month are expected but we are in process of revising this system. Participation in group meals in encouraged, but not mandated. We strive to work cooperatively for mutual benefit, while respecting personal autonomy and the privacy of one's home. We actively participate in neighborhood events and act as a CSA drop-off site. 

We do on-site composting and have eight raised-bed gardens with organic soil. We are committed to conserving natural resources through environmentally-sound construction, energy conservation, recycling, and reducing consumption by sharing materials. All common areas and individual units are accessible to people with disabilities. We value diversity and welcome people from all classes, races, cultures, sexual orientations, and traditional and nontraditional families.

Touchstone is a neighborhood of thirty-four (soon to be 46) households built on six acres in Scio Township. Ann Arbor is unique in having 3 cohousing communities on the same block.  This allows for expanded community and greater sharing of resourses.   Touchstone is a community created and sustained by its residents with the intention of sharing the joys and challenges of life and appreciating each individual. Decisions are made using consensus. For more information, call Robin at (734) 274-9110 or email tours@touchstonecohousing.org.  Our website is www.touchstonecohousing.org.

Higher Ground is comprised of 39 single-family homes on seven acres about three miles east of downtown Bend. The community was planned to provide maximum open space for meadows, play areas, pond, trails, and vegetable garden. Our common house was the original farmhouse on this property, and we completed a large new dining/kitchen/recreation addition. People choosing to buy or rent these homes are interested in a socially supportive environment for themselves and their families. Many homes have been constructed with innovative environmentally responsible building materials. We share general maintenance responsibilities, and find this to be a valuable component in building community. We also take conflict resolution seriously and periodically provide positive opportunities for personal growth.

There is a large community building, called a common house, for optional shared meals (five nights a week), and other activities. We are located ten minutes from downtown Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Cobb Hill (www.cobbhill.org) is a community of people who are exploring ways to live that are ecologically, materially, and socially sustainable. Built in 2001, our community comprises 23 energy-efficient homes, a working farm and dairy and a number of member-owned agricultural enterprises: award-winning cheese, frozen yogurt, mushrooms, maple syrup, and sheep. Our 260-acre property includes a large common house, barns, hiking and cross-country ski trails, a managed forest, pastures, sugar bush and gardens. Homes feature solar hot water, passive-solar orientation, green building design, a central wood-burning system, and high-speed internet.

Our community is intergenerational, with ages ranging from babies to 80s. Kids love having a playing field, their own art area, acres and acres of woods to explore, and the opportunity to learn about farming through 4H. Adults have fun here too, with frequent community dinners and lots of social events: open mikes, an annual prom, special dinners, singing, campfires, and frequent impromptu gatherings. Our decision-making is by consensus, and we have a very strong informal mutual support system (we take care of each other). A few of our residents are retired; the rest practice a variety of professions including forestry, sustainability nonprofits, homemaking, medicine, farming, cheesemaking and high tech. Serious about trying to live more sustainably, both in our infrastructure and in our lifestyle, we look for members who share our interests and intentions and who will be active participants in community life.

Cobb Hill Cohousing is located just 20 minutes from Dartmouth College and from one of New England’s premier medical centers. This is a vibrant area where the arts flourish and outdoor recreational opportunities abound. Excellent schools and a healthy, safe environment make it a great place to raise children. Here are some links showing the wide range of opportunities in our local area: hop.dartmouth.edu, northernstage.org, dailyuv.com, vitalcommunities.org, uppervalleyfood.coop, uvtrails.org, osher.dartmouth.edu.

We share in creating and caring for a resourceful, productive, and resilient community to support environmentally sustainable living, and we govern ourselves through use of sociocracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/champlain-valley-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/champlain-valley-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Do you belong at Champlain Valley Cohousing? We welcome all interested in environmental sustainability, compassionate relationships, and living meaningful lives. 

Do you seek community? As a community, we are dedicated to knowing each other in a meaningful way. We help each other with childcare, meals, and all sorts of projects. 

Do you crave space? We have privately owned homes clustered around a central green and collectively own another 115 acres of meadows and forest.

Our homes are clustered around a central green, enabling little ones to enjoy safe independence and allowing all neighbors to enjoy spontaneous and meaningful social interaction.

Our land lies in the charming rural village of Charlotte, Vermont. We are 14 miles from the vibrant city of Burlington, which has a lively downtown pedestrian mall, several small colleges, the University of Vermont, a regional teaching hospital, and an international airport. Middlebury, a charming college town, is an easy commute south. The international city of Montreal is an easy two-hour drive north. Gorgeous Lake Champlain is just four miles away.

Our land consists of 125 acres of rolling farmland, wetlands, meadows, brooks, woods, hiking paths, and ponds. Surrounded by distant views of Buck Mountain, Mt Philo, and a glimpse of the Adirondack peaks, we are a rural, pedestrian-centered community with townhomes and single-family homes around an extensive central green. Excellent public schools, and pre-K through 12th grade Waldorf schools serve the community. 

Some 115 of our 125 acres are preserved forever for wildlife corridors and farming. Our parking is on the periphery of our neighborhood, making it safe for little ones and pedestrian-centric.

We privately own our own modest homes. We share the trails, pastures, organic gardens, yurt, and the common green where potlucks and other social activities occur.

We enjoy occasional potluck dinners, work together on keeping our community beautiful, and have lots of fun. We are committed to living in a thoughtful way that promotes environmental sustainability and healthy community relationships.

-A diverse community providing the opportunity for all generations, economic levels, and religious, ethnic, and racial backgrounds to live together in supportive relationships.
-Where the architectural design promotes a comfortable balance between community interaction and privacy.
-Where attractive homes and common facilities will be designed on a model that is ecologically sound, emphasizing moderate consumption, resource sustainability, and horticulture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/altair-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/altair-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Altair is going into its 18th year, and currently consists of four families who have invested in the project. We follow the traditional Cohousing model, but are more of an EcoVillage.  We are looking to build 35 units for multi-family, ranging in size from studios to four-bedroom units. We have purchased an 8 acre site in Kimberton village and have purchased homes adjacent to the open land to assure we have access. Currently, we are working with the Planning Commission of the Township to update the Zoning to include an EcoVillage. 

We hold two meetings a month - a Discussion Group and a Site Development business meeting. We are soliciting new members and friends to help with the pre-approval costs.

Our goal is to build homes that are close to LEEDS platinum, with net-zero energy heating and cooling.  We would like to be able to help provide housing for the Waldorf School and the Camphill Village close by.

We anticipate having a Getting-it-Built workshop and design retreats for the site, Common House, and housing designs in the coming year. We have contacted banks and foundations to help with the funding.

We seek people of all ages and income levels. We have a competent developer, a zoning consultant, a land planner, and an architect.  We have formed a non-profit to create a funding stream to support local members.  At the moment, we need a solid group of investors!  You can visit our website or contact us by email or phone.</description>

If you want to participate in the sweat equity of cleaning up the land &amp; buildings, please contact me.  I hope to have livable shelter soon, but in the meantime, there is tent space galore!

On my recent (Dec 2010) visit, I received a great deal of spiritual nourishment from just spending time in the Spiral Garden again.

I will be visiting the west coast about every 3 or 4 months for the next phase.

Thanks for your interest in and support of intentional communities.</description>

We create models for autoless, livable cities for eco-homes to cities up to 90,000 people. We are offering design work for eco-cities, intentional communities, and cohousing for select groups. Ideally, we'd love to have investors to create a development. We're also open to join a community, preferably an Ithaca-ecovillage-type development. We're not of a particular religion, but we are tolerant. We love reading, designing sustainable communities, well-behaved pets and kids, research and writing, visiting hip communities, educational programs, homeschooling, history, gardening, light partying, controlled drinking, silly humor, tasty foods, lotsa friends, meeting interesting folks, music, living in the here and now while reflecting on the past and planning a better future.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22112&quot;&gt;Awaawaroa Bay Eco-Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our community is based on cooperation, honesty and consensus.
We have a willingness to balance individual needs with the greater good of the community, while also valuing people’s diversity.
Our community vision statement is as follows:
“We live in community, creating a safe, sustainable environment that encompasses and enhances wholesome relationships with each other and the land. We are a community who understands that our actions and behaviours influence the world of the future.”
To protect the native wildlife, there are no cats or dogs on the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/awaawaroa-bay-eco-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/awaawaroa-bay-eco-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Awaawaroa Bay Eco-Village owns 169 hectares (420 acres). There is a large wetland and estuarine system and a number of large pockets of regenerating bush. The village established NZ’s first private sanctuary for the endemic long finned eel (tuna – a Maori word for the eel).
A large section of the bush is covenanted with Department of Conservation.
To protect the native wildlife there are no cats or dogs on the property. 
Non toxic and energy-efficient building materials and methods are required. An internal building code is in place that is administered by a building committee. Most families use alternative power systems and there are a number of electric cars and bikes and biofuel vehicles on the property.
A communal tractor shed/barn has been built as well as a multi-purpose mud-brick community house and an accompanying abolution block which are used for meetings, celebrations and various group activities.
We aim for a chemical-free environment with all land-use practices to be organic. All land use is organic and several members practise Bio- dynamics. One land-base businesses operate from the community – a certified organic nursery ‘Gulf Trees’ which grows native fauna and another is in the process of being established.
Protecting and enhancing biodiversity in our ecosystems and natural habitats is a priority.</description>

Four miles away is downtown; one mile away is Atlanta's biggest alternative business district with a large natural-foods co-op. Within one-half mile are a fifty-acre city park, a sixteen-mile-long off-road bike trail, a subway station, and numerous bus stops. Two blocks away are shops and restaurants. Sidewalks, trees, and greenery are very abundant throughout the area. Our property intertwines with the Lake Claire Community Land Trust. And next to that is the Lake Claire Cohousing Community.

     Amata and the Land Trust are on a gorgeous, hilly, 2.5-acre plot with organic gardens, fruit orchards, solar well, farm animals, ponds, sauna, fire circle,  playgrounds, picnic tables, and a playfield. We have one large permanent house and several cottages.   

     People who visit here remark how it has a country in the city feeling. They are amazed at how much greenspace and gardens we have for an urban location.

     We have 4 core decision makers/owners and 24 residents who rent rooms and have input on some issues. We are moving toward allowing the residents to run the houses and handle the finances and hope to create a cooperative at some point, though most people seem to prefer to rent and have the freedom from handling daily management and finances.

     Amata's residents are varied in age, sex, religion, diet, race, career, education, etc. We have few rules except toc lean up after yourself and respect each other and the property/land/neighborhood.  Absolutely no hard drugs, no tobacco smoking indoors, or regular drunken behavior. No animals allowed in building commons. Our maintenance
man cleans all common areas and does the yardwork, he keeps the place clean and tidy, and repairs are done quickly.
 
      For fun there are various neighborhood festivals that  as well as drum circles and other musical events. There are a few festivals a year on the neighboring Lake Claire Land Trust. Nearby are plenty of coffee shops, art galleries, playhouses, music venues and other places to relax, plus restaurants and a good small grocery store. 
  
     Rents at Amata are reasonable for the neighborhood. As of 2015, these average about $650 for a medium bedroom with nice views of nature, utilities and wifi included, plus large tv with good cable.  We provide common food basics plus fresh fruit and fair trade coffee. Kitchen and bathrooms are shared, no particular group meals
but they happen spontaneously depending on who wants to cook, we don't have rules about that.

As of October 2015 we may have homes for sale. Please email or call us if you are interested in buying a home.

If this sound interesting to you, email to arrange a visit;  rooms open up about every 1.5-2 months on average. So come on by and visit, see if you like what we offer and it seems like a good fit.

We are an urban community of 18 households: singles, couples, and families. We completed Alberta's first cohousing project in May 2003. Prairie Sky is on three quarters of an acre two and a half miles from downtown Calgary, in three buildings that mix townhouses and apartments around a courtyard. We have a 3,400-sq ft common house that extends our private living spaces with a large kitchen and dining room, lounge, playroom, bathrooms, laundry, craft room, studio, rec room, guest room and office, and parking underground.

We have chosen to live where our actions reflect our commitment to our Prairie Sky neighbors and to social and environmental responsibility. We built for energy efficiency and water conservation, and for minimum sound transmission, so we'd stay friends in close quarters. We make decisions by consensus at monthly business meetings, and we divide responsibilities among six teams: Coordination, Building Care, Community Care, Landscape and Gardening, Social, and Common House.

We value diversity and community involvement. We do not share any ideology beyond the belief that living more closely with our neighbors enriches our lives. Sharing resources (a second car, magazines and newspapers, gardening and workshop tools, pet care, childcare, and rides to the airport) reduces our expenses. Sharing fun (common meals, movies, hiking, skiing, canoeing, guitar playing, dance lessons, music events, and whatever comes up) increases the joy in our lives.

We are a suburban cohousing community on 2.2 acres in Pleasant Hill, California, (near Walnut Creek, east of San Francisco). We have 32 self-sufficient townhouse-style units along with a common house (kitchen/dining room, sitting room, laundry, and kids’ room), workshop, organic garden, kiln, pool, and hot tub. We used energy efficient green building features in our original design and added photovoltaic solar panels after move-in. A hiking/biking trail, an elementary school, and various shops are all nearby. We moved in fall 2001. Please see our website for more information about our community.

Committed individuals and couples who are passionate about preserving this land, making campers feel welcomed and taking care of day-to-day operations are encouraged to apply!

We are a conservative, family-based organization. There is no smoking, drinking or drug use allowed on site by our volunteers. No visible tattoos or piercings, men must be clean shaven with short hair.

We intend to develop a truly close and deeply caring sense of community, togetherness, or empathic communion of hearts and minds, involving a substantial sense of emotional bonding, belonging, and inner connection of life energies, as a synergistic relational &quot;we,” an &quot;us.&quot; Our process of developing an optimal sense of harmonious, cohesive, community is grounded in a new understanding of optimal human relationship, interpersonal communication, and psychological growth, in which hearts, minds, and spirits are deeply connected to each other, in a state of nondualistic empathic communion, harmonious loving attunement, and co-creative synergy. We understand the process of developing open, empathic, deeply meaningful, honest, sincere, constructive, and generously giving, interpersonal communication. 


Through this process, as well as various other means, we help our members awaken to, and spontaneously express, their unique &quot;heartsong&quot;—i.e., their inherent, uniquely individual, archetypal life theme; basic natural life function; or most fulfilling life dream, vision, mission, or destiny, which provides them with an optimal sense of joyful, regenerative, life-energy flow. This relational process of psychological and spiritual growth produces holistic healings, of all kinds, as well as the enhanced actualization of one's natural real-life potentials. Relatedly, we have developed innovative programs in transformative education, arts and creative expression, mentoring, holistic healing, as well as global transformation of the collective heart of humanity. 


We are seeking new members who are predominantly relationship-oriented, and tend to be open to continued learning and growth, willing to question their own presumptions, as well as honest, warmhearted, mostly unselfish, generously giving of themselves, sincerely caring, and cooperative, rather than being habitually conflictual, willful, competitive, defensive, prideful, and selfish, in their relationship with others. Our community will serve as a model of constructive global transformation, grounded in psychological maturity, caring human relationships, as well as actualization of individual and relationship potentials, bringing optimal levels of productive functioning and well-being. 


Members are required to be financially self-supporting, and to live a wholesome, productive, lifestyle. No addictive substances or sexual promiscuity are permitted in this community.
&lt;/div&gt;

For non-members as well as members of our community, we offer spiritual/transformational life coaching and relationship counseling services. We can teach you how to be intuitively guided by your own soul, and to connect to what is genuine in yourself, other individuals, and the spiritual reality of life and love.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22118&quot;&gt;Rose Creek Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Follow Christ by his Spirit and love one another as He loves us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/rose-creek-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/rose-creek-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Rose Creek Village, nestled among the rolling, wooded hills of west Tennessee, is home to an astonishing experiment in corporate living, with breathtaking results.

Can Americans get along? Can they give up their private dreams and goals and live for others? It was the claim of Jesus Christ that those who embrace his teachings, his Gospel, and his Life would be recognized by their enthusiastic love and togetherness. “Everyone will know you are my disciples by your love for one another,” he said.

Twenty five years ago a few men wondered if these things were true, and they gave themselves to God to find out. Many things have changed over those years. Many more men, women, and children have joined them, some have gone away, and we have had to learn both our weaknesses and God’s provision. We are still changing and learning, but we can now say unequivocally that the claims Jesus Christ made 2,000 years ago are true even in 21st century America.

We invite you to come and see the work God has done. We have found his Life to be a joyful one. We have learned that people are made to live as friends, caring for and serving one another. We have learned that children raised in such an environment are free, creative, daring, reliable, and filled with joy. While America has seen its share of communes filled with loose living and bizarre cults created by controlling religious fanatics, we have been told repeatedly that one look at our children at play is enough to prove this is not so at Rose Creek Village.

“And they steadfastly continued in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship and in breaking of bread and prayers. Every soul felt a sense of awe…all the believers were together, and they had everything in common… They broke bread from house to house, and they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with everyone.”

It is this beautiful picture that first captivated our hearts. We have had the delight to see it come into reality in our daily lives. Though we are human and we face the same struggles that others face, none of us ever struggles alone. The grace of God is very real to us, and the harmony we experience is only because of his presence among us.

You can learn more about us at our website. We are not extraordinary people—we are very real, ordinary people who had nothing good to offer God, but who have been carried along by him into this amazing life we call Rose Creek Village.

We wanted housing that would support greater social interconnectedness while making efficient use of resources. With the support and services of our selected professional team, we managed the challenges of the development process: securing a site, negotiating with the regulatory authorities for development approvals, securing the financing, building membership, and creating an organizational structure that allowed for an effective and timely consensus decision-making process. We formed a development corporation and acted as the developer to complete a 22-home multi-family residential building with 3400 sq ft of common amenity area. Construction was completed in October of 2001. 
Each household at Cranberry Commons privately owns a complete, self-contained home. Community connection is supported by the physical layout of our site and by the involvement of all members in the development and operation of the community using consensus decision making. 
In addition to its social focus, Cranberry Commons holds respect for the environment as one of its highest values. We have attempted to incorporate sustainability into every aspect of the community design, starting with the selection of the site right up to the solar hot water panels that were installed on the roof.</description>

The Middle Road Community is a cohousing community in southeastern British Columbia. We live on 21 hectares (52 acres) of land about 11 kilometres (7 miles) from the lovely art and ski community of Nelson (population 10,000) in the Selkirk Mountains. The land, which includes a mixture of forest, wetland and fields, is situated on an open bench along the north shore of the west arm of Kootenay Lake. The natural habitat is home to a variety of birds and wildlife. Half of the land is taken up by privately owned home sites and the other half is held in common. Title for common land is tied legally to the 11 private lots.

The common land includes forested areas, streams, a two-and-a-half acre fenced area containing organic gardens and a small orchard, horse pasture, a playing field, a chicken coop, a root cellar, and a large community fire pit. The Common House, a converted hay barn, is at the heart of the community–-consisting of a large kitchen and dining area, a games area, a quiet room, an activity room, a ping-pong room, an exercise/weight room, a guest room, and bathrooms. The wood floors, fireplaces, and magnificent views make it a cozy and welcoming place. In warm weather, the large deck extending into the garden is popular. There are hikes up into the surrounding mountains, and a public beach is just a short drive (or reasonable walk) away.

Regular meetings are held once a month, with a summer break. Community decisions are made by consensus. The community is currently at capacity. We have no formal visitor or internship program.

Our statement of intention: &quot;Through Pinakarri — listening deeply — we learn to love&quot;. This is an aspiration and is explored, practiced and realised in many ways, personally and as a community. However no dogma associated.

We are a suburban intentional community of about 35 women, men and children in 14 houses (eight low-moderate income rentals, plus private ownership and private rentals).

The houses are climate-sensible with rain-water tanks and extensive use of grey water; we are also planning for photovoltaic systems and other renewables. In 2006 we won the inaugural Sustainability Award by our local government council. 

We share meals two times a week, a monthly open house community dinner, and a changing feast of planned and spontaneous social activities such as house concerts, nonviolent communication skills, satsang, and BBQs (we're Australian).

We cooperatively manage 8 rental properties and the commons. Decision-making is a workable combination of absolute consensus and delegated authority. We discuss things that matter at focused or casual fireside chats, community email list, business meetings, one on one, and listening/sharing heart circles.

Community training  includes Nonviolent Communication.

We have a guestroom for personal and community guests, fellow communards, AirBnB, WWOOFers and other travelers who contribute work.</description>

We are a cohousing community of 33 households, located on 33 acres in a beautiful natural setting in the town of Blacksburg, in the mountains of southwest Virginia on a ridge between the Blue Ridge and the Appalachians.

Most members moved in during 2002-2004, with complete buildout in 2005. Our Common House is built. We include families with young children and/or teenage children, couples, and singles. Membership has been by self-selection.
Our guiding values include:
• a commitment to have a supportive and enriching community that fosters connection with each other, the larger community, and the Earth;
• living in harmony with ecological systems;
• creating a balance between private life and community life;
• encouraging diversity in membership; and
• working to create and maintain creative and positive relationships through consensus decision making, open dialogue, and creative conflict resolution.

In addition to our own 17 acres of undisturbed woods, we're adjacent to a 169-acre park that is an old farmstead, and we're near a walking/biking trail into a national forest.

As we develop our policies, guidelines, and norms, we strive for mutually respectful ways towards consensus, and we also remember to have fun and enjoy the rewards of living in community.

We welcome diversity, encourage ecologically responsible living, and value active participation in the larger world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/takoma-village-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/takoma-village-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Takoma Village is the first urban cohousing community in the greater metro Washington, DC, area. We have ~90 residents with ~70 adults and 20 children. Those numbers vary but not far from that range.

We have forty-three attached condominium units that include flats, duplexes, and townhouses, plus the common house. Units range from one bedroom with a den to four bedrooms with a full basement. The common house includes two guest rooms, children's room, game room, office, living room, laundry room, exercise room, dining room, large kitchen, and workshop.

We are located one and a half blocks from the Takoma Metro Station (the Red Line) and within easy walking distance of shopping and restaurants on Georgia Avenue in DC and in Old Town Takoma Park in Maryland. Most residents commute by public transportation or bicycle. Many work at home full or part time.  On the Metro, we are 5 minutes from Union Station, 15 minutes from the center of the Mall, and 5 minutes from Silver Spring.

Residents range in age from just born to 90 and are well distributed across that range.

We have many energy-efficient systems and green materials. All units received the Energy Star rating. All have ground-source geothermal heating and cooling. We installed solar panels in 2015 that serve all common electrical uses and give back energy to the grid.

We maintain a notification list and occasionally have units for sale. We rarely have rooms for rent. Sales are at market rate. If you are interested in living in or visiting our community, please contact us. We are always delighted to meet new friends.

MCLC is situated on 240 acres in the spectacular wilderness of British Columbia. The land has an abundance of potable creek water, over five acres of rich, arable garden or crop lands, and forest reserves. Valhalla Park, with its hiking trails and glacial lakes, is our backyard. 
Members may purchase four-acre lots that are cooperatively owned according to a Share Purchase Agreement. Rentals are occasionally available to non members.
Some members prefer a more individualistic lifestyle, and their privacy is respected. We are five miles from the town of Slocan and 75 minutes from Nelson. We are off-grid and sometimes require four-wheel-drive during the weeks of Spring and Fall seasonal transitions. Individual driveways are not plowed during the winter &amp; there is a need to walk or ski varying distances from where the plowing ends.

The medieval village of Torri Superiore is situated in the Ligurian hinterland, close to the town of Ventimiglia (11 km away). Torri Superiore is an ecovillage and a member of the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN), RIVE (rete italiana veillaggi ecologici), and Accademia Italiana di Permacultura.

The village was abandoned by all original inhabitants, and progressively restored over the last 25 years by a community of Italians and Germans. The village is made of 160 rooms, all built in local stone and lime, which still feature the traditional arches and vaults.

The cultural association that has developed the project since 1989 is formed also by non-residents and owns about 50 percent of the village, while the other 50 percent is individually owned by the members. Only members of the association are entitled to buy property in Torri Superiore.

The restoration of the buildings respects the original characters of the beautiful hamlet while using ecological materials and appropriate technologies whenever possible. A variety of courses and educational activities is offered every year, on topics always related to sustainabilyt and communal living. Organic agriculture activities focus mainly on olive oil production and vegetable gardens to supply the community &amp; guesthouse.

The proximity to the beautiful river and the sea, the easily accessible walks on the surrounding mountains, and the mild climate make Torri Superiore an attractive location for ecologically sensitive people who appreciate the informal, friendly style of the group. A welcoming ecological guesthouse with cozy bedrooms, a large panoramic meeting room and an excellent organic restaurant is open to all visitors and groups. Check our facebook page for current events.

We are a Roman Catholic community of monks wholly ordered to contemplation, belonging to the Cistercian Order of the Strict Observance, more commonly known as Trappists. The monks are dedicated to the worship of God in a hidden life within the monastery following the Rule of St. Benedict. They lead a life of solitude and silence, prayer and penance, in a joyful spirit of faith. The monastic community supports itself by the common work of baking Monks' Bread. In addition, the brothers help out on the farm and with cooking, laundry, cleaning, hospitality, formation of new members, and care of the sick and elderly of the community. The community is cloistered and has no outside ministry. Guests are received for quiet, private retreats at the retreat house. The monastic day begins with vigils at 3:30 a.m. and ends with compline at 7:30 p.m. Throughout the day there is a good balance between prayer, reading, and work, all lived in fraternal love and support. Silence is practiced seriously. The brothers speak only when necessary and then as briefly as possible. Some of the brothers are priests; most are not. At the end of their formation program candidates take the monastic vows and remain with the community for the rest of their lives.

We are 14-15 active and creative people with a colorful variety of interests and fields. We share vegan meals every night and each of us is responsible for cooking dinner twice a month. We each have a cleaning chore and are part of a work team—food, finance, maintenance, or membership. We have quarterly work parties where we do maintenance projects around the house. We do various do-it-yourself projects together, including tending to our garden, brewing kombucha, fixing up bikes, etc. 

We run our twice monthly meetings by consensus and use rotating facilitation in an effort to create a nonhierarchical system of governance.

The Sherwood Co-op is the last organizational remnant of the Students Cooperative Association started in the 1930s by University of Washington students, which at its high point was on a level with the Ann Arbor and Berkeley campus co-op systems. The SCA sold off all of its holdings in the late 1950s. Sherwood rented our current house from the late 1970s until 2001, when we bought it. We take great pride in the accomplishment of a few students to finance and see through the legal work of purchasing our property. We received help from the North American Students of Cooperation (NASCO) in this endeavor.

Since the purchase of our house, we have joined the Evergreen Land Trust (ELT) to ensure that our property remains a cooperative. Our long-term goal is for Sherwood to act as an economic and organizational engine for the development of other co-ops. Our short-term goals are to steward our house, to support and learn from each other, and to have fun while we do it. 

 There is so much more to say about our house and ourselves. If you would like more information about Sherwood, or if you are interested in membership or subletting, email us.

We are an independent housing co-op in a historic neighborhood on the near west side of Madison, Wisconsin. The co-op was formed in 1970 when we obtained ownership of a large, three-story house from an agricultural fraternity at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

The membership has gone through many changes since then, but the goal has always been to provide affordable housing in a friendly, family-like community environment. Our diverse membership includes students, professionals, and working folks from all walks of life, and we share no particular political or ideological bent.

We all share the duties of running the house, from cooking to cleaning to keeping the books, through a work-job system that entails about five hours per week of work, plus dish-washing or floor-mopping duty every week or so.

The heart of our community life revolves around the delicious, vegetarian-option house meals served Sunday through Thursday at 6pm. We make decisions, usually by simple majority, at mandatory house meetings held every two and a half weeks. Temporary committees are regularly created to handle specific projects such as financial planning or landscape planning.

What makes us special? We're a bunch of quirky, unrelated folks who manage to operate almost like a family and run a clean, friendly home, and it works!

Audre Lorde Co-op is a 15-room household that provides a safe space for people of all ages committed to advocating a sustainable and socially just society. We are an actively pro-people-of-color, racial justice, pro-feminist, and pro-queer/LGBT-loving household. Our intent is to bring together individuals in an environment that fosters and is supportive of their activist endeavors, as well as creating a safe place for living. House decisions are made by group-modified consensus. Community meals are vegetarian with a vegan option. We are located near Phoenix, Lothlorien, Ambrosia, Nottingham, and Rivendell Co-ops. 

House members contribute roughly 5-6 hours of their time each week for work jobs such as cooking, washing dishes, cleaning various common spaces, paying bills, grocery shopping, serving as a house representative for the board and various committees of Madison Community Cooperative, and many other jobs that go toward the upkeep and continuance of the household.

Everyone in the house pays $95 a month to purchase bulk food that is mostly organic and locally grown when possible; we strive to buy from vendors that are owned and run by people of color and/or women. A vegan or vegetarian meal is cooked every night of the week around 7 p.m., except on Saturdays.  

We have house meetings every other Sunday night that can last anywhere from forty-five minutes to three hours. These meetings are a chance for us to communicate with one another as a group about any issues, problems, plans, or changes, in a forum that insures everyone an equal chance to be heard.

Elsworth Co-op is primarily directed toward students, but anyone is welcome to live here. Tenants are required to sign a lease through the end of the current school year. Rent is adjusted to make it as low as possible, because our main focus is on &quot;housing for people--not for profit.&quot; Another requirement is that each tenant must work roughly five hours each week toward betterment of the house. Duties vary and include such things as cleaning, cooking, and general maintenance. We have a meal plan that caters to both vegetarians and meat eaters.

Toad Lane cooperative split from New Community in the 80s, and in 1997 New Community became an Honors theme house for several years, before returning to open membership.</description>

Sunwise co-op is an eight-bedroom, passive solar house in suburban Davis, California. It belongs to the larger organization of the Solar Community Housing Association. Our house is located on a greenbelt with a large garden, bees, and chickens. The members of our house are both students and professionals (all low income) who share the roles of maintaining the house, working together towards many goals including social justice, environmentally conscious living, and education. We also share meals, chores, stories, toothpaste, and our time. We make consensus-based decisions during house meetings in order to ensure that all members of the household are heard and appreciated. The house welcomes applicants who are open to a diverse household working together to live consciously.

We are living in separate families and one single person. The indoor and outdoor facilities make it great for children, but when they grow older it is a hassle because of the 4-kilometer transport to the village and 10 kilometers to town. We had to transport them a lot by car. When they reach the age 0f 18-20 years they used to move to a bigger town to go on with some education. But they love to come home to visit. Where else will it be possible to have a party with 60-80 friends.

We have lived together as nabours and friends for a long time (7 -25 years) and used a lot of work to change the old farm to a very original and comfortable living place. Grown-up children have moved from home and no more babies are expected. Waiting for grandchildren! Most of us work outside of the community. One couple grows vegetables (organic) and meat-sheep  for our self-support.
Most of the community members do some handcraft or artistics. 

Our place is so far out of any other settlement, that we depend on the use of cars, even if we do a lot of biking.

Community De Hobbitstee, in the Netherlands, was founded in 1969, so it already has existed for 45 years. The desires to change society, to stimulate personal growth, to get rid of bourgeois mentality were important aims for the initiators in the late 1960s. Times change, just as people do, and their social environment changes.

But the primal ideas of seeking love, harmony, and simplicity are still the drives, the wells from which present inhabitants draw their energy to form and re-form daily community life and our relation toward society. Besides the promotion of organic/biological agriculture, we organize volunteer days, have a small scale bakery, a campsite, a teepee, sweatlodge area and a couple of tiny houses for guests to stay.

We have plans for a new sustainable house where 2 of our families are going to live.

In Native American mythology, the dolphin represents the combination of heaven and Earth, spirituality and matter, vision and realization. We are already living communally in this sense, in a small communal home and others living within 10 kilometers. In our spiritual diversity, communal singing, eating, hiking, baby-sitting, decision making by consensus, and solving conflicts, we are learning from the experiences of older communities and are passing on our own experiences through the Ökodorf-Institute: consultations, festivals, a mail-order business, and seminars on searching for and founding communities. Regarding service to fellow human beings, at the moment we are supporting the establishment of free schools in Africa. We are friends with several dozen local residents and are in friendly contact with others. South Black Forest considers itself something of a melting pot, since southern and eastern Europeans have been working in the textile industry here for over 150 years. In the long run, we would like to establish a spiritual-ecological village in addition to being integrated into the existing village and region. This new village will probably be close by and will make it easier to become self-sufficient. We would like to build the village together with a regional network of friends of our community. As a first step in this direction, we have established a local labor-exchange system (Wiesentaler instead of Euro), and we will use the Artabana health community instead of health insurance.

We trust that God/inner voice will guide us in deciding what to do next, just as we have been guided so well since 1995. People interested in joining should first send us a page about themselves and their vision. We will then send more information about ourselves as well.

In 2009 we have been searching to buy a farm in Germany or near it with some hectares to plant our own vegetables, etc. We also want to grow our community in such a way that we can help old, dying members to die in a good way, inside our community.

Bread and Roses is a Christian-based community living in a rented 18-room building and two adjacent appartments in Hamburg, Germany. We live together, share our house with homeless refugees and migrants, and share income and a lot of other resources. We are inspired by the Catholic Worker movement, other houses of hospitality, and Christian communities in the United States, Latin America and Europe. We have daily morning prayer and an occasional public worship and try to spread our social vision by inviting people to our house and by social actions for marginalized people. We are pacifists and try to live simply to protect the environment. Although presently we live in the city, a sister community in the countryside would be wonderful.

Our community is a part of downtown Cotati, California (population 6,700). We are a typical cohousing community in that we are not organized around any particular religious, economic, political, or lifestyle focus, other than our intention to create a neighborhood that by its physical design and social structure facilitates community.

Our community houses 30 families (including singles, couples with and without children, and single parents) in townhouse-style attached homes. Our common house includes a kitchen, dining room, guest rooms, children's room, and a workshop.

We're a little different from many cohousing communities in that we were required by the city of Cotati to include 6700 square feet of retail space as part of our development. We decided to keep ownership of this retail space as a community. We now live next door to a handful of small businesses, which are locally owned.

Community dinners and workdays are a part of our lives. Our key policy decisions are made by consensus, and we meet once monthly for two-hour business and community-development meetings.

Our group formed out of the old Acacia Cohousing Group in Santa Rosa, California, a group which started meeting in November of 1994. The current group came together in the late summer/early fall of 1998, and in January 2000 we found a 2.3 acre parcel of land in downtown Cotati. With the help of the Cohousing Company (Nevada City, California), and our developer, Wonderland Hill (Boulder, Colorado), construction was completed and residents began moving into their new homes in 2003.

Vallersund Farm is a small Camphill village located on the coast of Trøndelag. It is a village out of the ordinary that offers care to people with special needs.

The ‘Fram-school’ is also located here, which is an educational service for young adults with learning disabilities.

We have organic farming and gardening, sheltered workshops and teaching.

The intentional community of Vallersund is also an Eco-village with an interest in alternative energy. We have a windmill that covers our energy needs. A heat pump extracts energy from the sea which heats our houses. A biological purifying plant treats the waste-water before it is returned to the sea.

Vallersund Gård was once a bustling trading post that today is part of the national protection-plan for old buildings.

Hey! We're still here ('Earth Day' 'April 22, 2018')! Feel free to email us but do NOT send form mail! All form mails will get no response.

NOTE!!! : People have been contacting us for YEARS after NOT having read our website. Read !! :

1. WE HAVE NO LAND (YET!) OR PLACE FOR YOU TO STAY. A primary motivating purpose of this Project is to GATHER TOGETHER those who CANNOT AFFORD to buy land title, etc. and POOL our resources in order to buy that land title etc.!

2. We want self-starting people who see that it is ALL OF US who MUST make this Project happen rather than relying on someone else to build it. 

&quot;Once upon a time there were four people: Their names were Everybody, Somebody, Nobody, and Anybody. Whenever there was an important job to do Everybody was sure that Somebody would do it. Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it. When Nobody did it, Everybody got angry because it was Everybody’s job. Everybody thought Somebody would do it, but Nobody realized that Nobody would do it. So consequently Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody could have done in the first place.&quot;

If you are still interested after reading the above, continue on to our Basic Description below! :

-------------------------

 The purpose of the Paradise Restoration Project is to create Paradise Gardens sanctuaries worldwide.

'Paradise' means 'garden sanctuary' (from the Persian word 'pairidaeza', pairi meaning 'park' or garden, 'daeza' meaning 'enclosed' or 'sanctuary').

Raw fruitarian (killing and injury-free) diet as the ideal, sharing 'ownership' (shared land title) regardless of finances, independence from the need for 'money' (meaning being truly 'off the grid' in EVERY way), co-helping the poor, disabled, discouraged, misunderstood, misfit, outcast, creative peaceful and loving people to pool financial and all other resources in order to obtain land title and other necessities of living in paradisial gardens. 

Decision making by 100% consensus council, 'extended family' values, love and co-operation, co-creative endeavours, freedom from addictions and true dedication to the greater good of the whole are central precepts.

Religious / spiritual values include all those that are conducive to the simple living basics of life in paradise
or Paradisianism. Paradisian/Ebionite/Essene/Nazorean/Os

It includes the following three divisions, all located at the village of Otse in the South East District.

Rankoromane School offers residential care and primary school education for children with special needs from the ages of 5 to 14 years. Enrolment is currently 61 of which 50 are residential and 11 come to school daily from the local community.

Legodimo Youth Training offers pre-vocational training and support to people leaving the school and other young people with special needs. The training includes vocational skills such as horticulture, catering and crafts, functional skills such as literacy, numeracy and IT as well as personal / social skills. Enrolment is currently 30 students. It has a two year programme that prepares learners for further training at Motse wa Badiri Training.

Motse Wa Badiri Training offers further Foundation training in the same three areas of vocational, functional and personal / social skills in a two year programme including preparation and support for the transition back into the community and employment or other sustainable life choices.

Motse wa Badiri Training also offers supported living and sheltered employment for a number of people who feel the need to stay longer. Motse Wa Badiri, which means &quot;the village where people work&quot; in Setswana, is a Camphill Community located in Otse, a rural village 45km south of Gaborone, the capital of Botswana. We are a charitable NGO that offers vocational training, employment and where necessary, accommodation and social support, to people with disabilities. We are able to offer these services through the operation of four income generating workshops.</description>

We are continually seeking ways to live more lightly on the land.
PARING-We are committed to keeping the interests of the land foremost in all our decisions.  This is why we are clustering the homes on six acres, siting the community on the steeper portions of the property that is less suitable for gardening, are working with the natural contours of the land in laying out the community, and giving much thought to where to site gardens and activities.
SHARING-An ethic of finding ways to community as it naturally arises from living lives that consciously intersect with the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/hundredfold-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/hundredfold-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hundredfold Farm is a 14-household rural cohousing community in the Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, area. The members of this multi-generational community are learning together as they explore the art of living in a sustainable way.   The cohousing model is characterized by private dwellings, clustered housing, pedestrian-friendly design, and extensive common facilities. We promote sustainability with organic community gardens, active and passive solar components in our energy efficient homes and an innovative wastewater treatment  facility that recycles water to our homes.                        
.
Some goals of Hundredfold Farm:
•	To function together in a rich, supportive manner so that everyone will flourish.
•	To provide an alternative to the loneliness that pervades our individualistic society.
•	To own and manage the common land jointly, while owning our own private homes.
•	To cluster the homes in order to reduce the impact on open space and agricultural land.
•	To produce a significant amount of our own wholesome and healthy food using sustainable practices.
•	To be a community of tolerance, open to everyone regardless of age, income, ethnicity, sexuality, or family situation.

Site features:
•	An interlacing of native woodland, fields, pond, walking paths, and hills.
•	The upper plateau of our 80-acre property offers a 180-degree view of the surrounding area.
•	Member-owned working Christmas-tree farm onsite.
•	Organic garden plot onsite since 2001.
•	Existing eight-room, two-bath historic house with a second-story wrap-around veranda overlooking the pond.
•	Our vision for the site includes gazebo, sauna, meditation spots, tree house, and other communal gathering spaces.
•	One hour from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
•	One and a half hours from Baltimore and Washington, DC, metro areas.
•	Within a one hour drive of 10 college and university campuses.
.
Single family homes and eco-site plan:

•	High quality, energy-efficient single-family homes.
•	A village concept of the 14 homes balancing the need for privacy with opportunities for spontaneous social interaction.
•	A pedestrian greenway between the homes that can be used by emergency vehicles if need be.
•	Two convenient parking areas located at the perimeter of the housing cluster.
•	All homes are of passive solar design.
•	Innovative community waste-water treatment and recycling system.</description>

Beyond that we do not define ourselves by what we eat, believe or do; though individual members do have various strains of activism, spirituality, dietary ethics and personal codes central to their lives.  Tolerance and understanding are way more important than signing up to any particular code.  Be yourself, but be enough of a grown up to have thought about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/earthworm-housing-co-op/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/earthworm-housing-co-op/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Once a commune, now a co-housing project with a shared house in the middle, Earthworm Housing Co-operative owns three residential buildings and seven acres of land on the border of Shropshire, Hereford and Powys. 

We make decisions through regular meetings and on a day-to-day basis always by consensus. The group's membership and direction have undergone several changes since the co-operative was formed in 1989, but the same original principles and ideals remain, including an ecological focus, managing land for resilience, productivity and health, limiting use of products that poison and pollute, and trying to be more ethical consumers.

We farm our land by organic methods, using techniques from fields as diverse as bio-dynamics, permaculture and old-boy allotment-style! We use composting toilets and have recently built a wetland  system to process sewage, greywater and wastewater from the house. We grow seasonal vegetables, herbs, and fruit in the gardens, polytunnels and greenhouse.

Vegans, meat-eaters and people in between all share space, collaborating and communicating clearly and well.
  
We host some gatherings, courses, and camps, but mostly members are just getting on quite conventionally, making their livlihoods in our border region.  

Some members are parents, some are growers, some are brewers and some are teachers.  Our origins include Germany as well as Ireland, England and Scotland.  The co-op has had literally hundreds of members since it was legally constituted in 1989, but has been quite stable since 2011, focusing on the renovation of all the buildings.

It began as a 'commune' in 1975, and many waves of people have contributed to the abundance and challenges we now enjoy as a productive, outward-looking housing co-operative.</description>

    We bring joy to our work and play.
    We resolve conflict responsibly.
    We live interdependently and acknowledge our individuality.
    We contribute to our community.
    We care for each other.
    We live lightly on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bellingham-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bellingham-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The mission of Bellingham Cohousing is to work together to create a diverse multigenerational neighborhood of 33 homes on the historic Donovan Farm site. We intend to be supportive of one another, share resources, and strive to be stewards of the land. We aspire to collaborate with the larger Bellingham community to build housing for mixed-income households.
Bellingham Cohousing is a living situation that requires considerable neighbor participation. Bellingham Cohousing residents dedicate as much as 20 hours per month attending committee meetings, planning meals and community activities, and working on community projects.

Although Bellingham Cohousing is a supportive community, it is not designed or intended to be an environment for individuals needing therapeutic levels of attention or care.

Bellingham Cohousing offers many opportunities for neighbors to develop and foster a sense of community through:

    Optional common meals several times a week
    Working together on projects around the site and in groups and committees
    Managing our community together through consensus-based decision-making
    Community-wide celebrations of major life events: Already we have had 2 weddings and fantastic birthday celebrations
    And...casual discussions, book groups, salon-style discussions, a regular mid-morning coffee klatch, barbecues and potlucks, performances and talent shows, impromptu dinner concerts, and other shared activities ranging from shopping expeditions to sea kayaking and backcountry skiing

Arcadia is a pedestrian-oriented residential cohousing community on 16 acres of wooded land. Thirty-three individually owned homes are clustered on five acres around a centrally located common house. The remaining land held in common includes woods, pond, stream, organic gardens, outdoor play spaces, and the common house with kitchen, dining area, guest rooms, playroom, office, laundry room, and storage areas. The majority of homes have a passive solar design and the common areas are handicapped accessible. We are located near rural areas about three miles from the towns of Carrboro and Chapel Hill.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22151&quot;&gt;Tamera - Healing Biotope I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Healing Biotope I Tamera is a peace research project with the goal to create the model for a future society that is free from hatred, lies, violence and fear. Tamera should become an acupuncture point of peace, a greenhouse of trust, a prototype for an existence free of fear on this planet, a post-capitalist societal model and a place where the human and meta realm of life come together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/tamera-healing-biotope-i/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/tamera-healing-biotope-i/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Tamera is a Peace University, a model for a peace civilization and a research Station for a realistic utopia. 
The project was founded in Germany in 1978 by Dieter Duhm, Sabine Lichtenfels and Charly Rainer Ehrenpreis. In 1995 it moved to Portugal. Today 170 people live and work on a property of 330 acres. 
The founding thought was to develop a non-violent life model for cooperation between human being, animal and nature. Soon it became clear that the healing of love and of human community had to be placed at the center of this work. Sexuality, love and partnership need to be freed from lying and fear, for there can be no peace on Earth as long as there is war in love. The ecological and technological research of Tamera includes the implementation of a retention landscape for the healing of water and nature, as well as a model for regional autonomy in energy and food. Through the Global Campus and the Terra Nova School we are working within a global network on the social, ecological and ethical foundations for a new Earth – Terra Nova.</description>

Haidakandi Love is a center inspired by Baba JI where the primary focus is on faith, great cosmic energy (God), and spiritual and emotional work on oneself. Fundamental is the discovery of the void within, and devotion becomes the instrument that fills this void. The fire of devotion creates union between the people in their diversity. We work with energy, teach Reiki, and work on various aspects of the person--physical, emotional, and spiritual. Healing and devotion form the basis of the center. All the cultures of the Earth are invited to offer their teachings. We are preparing to be self-sufficient in electricity, water, and fruit and vegetables. We hope to have another family living and working with us in the near future to create total self-sufficiency.

On the edge of the town of Crediton in Devon 5 residents live in a semi-detached Georgian house bought by Corani in 2013. In Leicester two residents live in a terraced Victorian house bought by Corani in 1996. Three other members, not currently housed by Corani, live elsewhere in Leicester.
The Crediton house has a large garden around it in which we grow as many fruits, vegetables and herbs as we can, whilst leaving enough space to play football with the dog. We have chickens and a homemade beehive with a successful colony that produces delicious honey.
We aim to live as sustainably as we can in our current situation; The Leicester house has installed solar panels and the Crediton house have ongoing work making the house as insulated as possible.
The Corani members in each house share all communal living spaces and food and eat together every evening. In Crediton a casual cooking rota means that everyone cooks at least once a week. Decision making is essentially pragmatic: by consensus where all are concerned, otherwise with sensitive autonomy.
Things some or all of us like to do are: being outside, growing things, making things, carpentry, plumbing, playing music, dancing, climbing rocks and mountains, camping, bird watching, promoting sustainability, promoting devolved government.
We don’t currently have the capacity to take on new members, but may wish to do so in the future, so if you would like to learn more about Corani then please do get in touch.</description>

We offer a home, meaningful work and opportunities for personal development to adults with learning disabilities and other special needs. In all some 200 people live and work within the Newton Dee community. Around half have special needs. The others are mainly co-workers and their families.
 
The ethos of Newton Dee is that everyone brings different abilities, which we use for the benefit of the people around us.
 
Newton Dee's home life is based around large and small households ranging from four to 16 people. In addition we have some shared houses, apartments and bed-sitters.
 
There are 36 houses in Newton Dee's wooded grounds, which extend to a total of 180 acres, of which 120 acres is dedicated to our biodynamic farm.

Newton Dee Village is one of 90 Camphill communities around the world. We are a semi-rural community of around 200 people, 86 of whom are adults with learning disabilities. We are an Anthroposophical based community. We work out of Christianity and celebrate the festivals of the year.

We live and work together in 36 households on a 180-acre estate (120 acres are dedicated to our bio-dynamic farm and gardens).

Cornerstone has two large Victorian houses in Chapeltown, an ethnically diverse part of Leeds. Both houses need a lot of ongoing maintenance, and have large gardens front and back, which we variously hang out in, tend, or leave wild—attracting wildlife and producing some food (herbs, fruit and vegetables). Between us there is space for up to 16 members to live, though there are often visitors. One house has an office &amp; computer facilities, both houses have wifi. 

Each house has a food kitty, members eat together each night and communal food is vegan, although the houses are vegetarian. There is an emphasis on members being socially active, and members are often involved in local and national campaigns on a diverse range of issues, from asylum seeking to radical ecological action to queer politics. Footprint Workers Cooperative and the Cornerstone Resource Centre (providing resources for campaigns) are based in the cellar of one house.

Cornerstone is a member of Radical Routes (www.radicalroutes.org.uk), the UK network for radical co-ops promoting cooperation and working for social change. We encourage investors to take out shares in Rootstock (ww.rootstock.org.uk), investors' co-op, to support this work and fund new co-operatives.

Co-workers join Clanabogan as volunteers and do not receive wages, their material needs being met from a common fund. In all aspects of life and work, mutual agreement is the basis of a committed and responsible involvement. Camphill Communities are based on Christian principles and are non-denominational, many festivals are celebrated socially and artistically throughout the year. The Community meets for religious and cultural gatherings and people are free to attend a church of their choice or to follow their own conscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/clanabogan-camphill-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/clanabogan-camphill-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We have 70 acres in the beautiful rolling countryside of county Tyrone, Ireland, four miles from the town of Omagh. The community began in 1984, and now about 70 people live here in six households, some large, some small.
In this therapeutic community, adults who have difficulties arising from mental and emotional disability live and work together with coworkers and children.

Agriculture and horticulture are very important activities in the community and provide healthy and meaningful work as well as enhancing people's awareness of the environment, the seasons, and the land on which they live. Food production is done using biodynamic principles.

Coworkers join Clanabogan as volunteers and do not receive wages, their material needs being met from a common fund. In all aspects of life and work, mutual agreement is the basis of a committed and responsible involvement.
This is an attempt to live in a new kind of community life, to include people of many nationalities and people with different problems, strengths, and weaknesses. Most people, whether disadvantaged or not, find that as well as encountering struggles and challenges, they meet interesting and rewarding experiences, learn new skills, grow, and develop.</description>

Two Acre Wood Cohousing is a community in the traditional cohousing mold. We are generally all politically progressive, environmentally conscious, and interested in learning to live together in a supportive, loving community with lots of room for individual differences. We have no official philosophy.

We moved into our brand-new homes in the summer of 1999. So far only three units have changed hands as of early 2016.

We do have one or two possible rental homes and, sometimes, house sitting opportunities. We will be maintaining a list of people who might be interested in purchasing or renting a unit should one become available. If you would like to be on a notification list for future openings, email your name, email address, and phone number to cjmorrigan@gmail.com.

Our homes line pedestrian pathways and courtyards that are all handicapped accessible. Our 2.7 acres of land are located in a multicultural neighborhood. Some of our values include working cooperatively with our surrounding neighbors, using consensus, resolving conflicts using Restorative Justice, sharing work and social activities, environmental preservation, and building support and neighborliness among ourselves.

We all have rough edges that could use smoothing.  It helps to be able to experience misunderstandings and disagreements as opportunities to grow. Cohousing to us means community: child-friendly, elder-friendly, sociable living; cooperative interaction; a chance to make long-term personal connections with neighbors who share many of your values. In many ways we’re like an extended family more than a neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/cascadia-commons/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/cascadia-commons/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Cascadia Commons Cohousing is a community of 26 homes and a common house located in a pleasant suburb six miles southwest of the center of Portland, Oregon. We were self-developed over the period beginning with our incorporation as an LLC in 1995 (after a couple of years as a talking group). Construction was completed in 2001. We continue to develop as an &quot;second-generation&quot; community.
We occupy 2.9 acres of land, of which approximately half is legally designated wetlands and wetlands buffer that is required to be maintained in a natural state. Our homes are a mix of renovated townhouses, and newly constructed flats and townhouses. We are a quarter of a mile from good bus service to the center of Portland, a 35-minute ride. It takes about 10-15 minutes by car.
Our current residents range in age from one to 82. We are a mix of singles, single moms, couples, and families. We are ecumenical as to religion, or lack thereof, philosophy, sexual orientation, dietary preferences, and, at least in principle, politics. We share green values of caring for the earth and its creatures.
We are egalitarian in our governance, using consensus decision making, with provision for breaking impasses, as required by Oregon's condominium law.

We are a small suburban community facing a lagoon between San Mateo and Foster City, California. We purchased a four-unit building in 1998 and after seven years of waiting, in 2005, we purchased the second building. We have planted fruit trees and extensive organic gardens, are beekeepers, and in 2012 added aquaponics. We are a cooperative—something between intentional community and cohousing, though we identify most with the concept of a mini-ecovillage. We had hoped to have co-owners but the mortgage market has made that difficult, so this is mostly a community of renters.  In 2015, 72% of the second building was sold to three other co-owners, including a couple who had been renting for a few years. We have worked to help develop more of a community within the local neighborhood. The location is wonderful: lots of birds, sunrise over the water, nearby biking/walking path, park with playground, tennis/basketball courts, and city amenities of proximity to freeway and public transportation, etc.

Values we would like to see &quot;grow&quot; on this site can be summed up in the concept of sustainable development: growing some of our own food; supporting local organic farmers in farmers' markets or in a community-supported agriculture (CSA); reducing, reusing, recycling; avoiding buying food and other items that contribute to the destruction of local economies and the environment. We want to share time in the garden, meals at the dinner table, and other activities with the people we live with. We seek open communication and a deep expression of feelings. We expect those wishing to join us to have a commitment to these values and goals as well.

Community founders are also very involved in progressive politics, and although not a requirement, would welcome people who share their passion for planetary transformation.
&lt;/div&gt;

Cascade Cohousing is cohousing modeled on the Danish and US experience described in the book &quot;Cohousing&quot; by McCammant and Durret.
We have a strong focus on the sharing of meals as a catalyst of &quot;sense of community&quot; and have three common meals per week available in our common house. Many community members are concerned about reducing the environmental impact of their lifestyles. We place a strong emphasis on both community and privacy. Half the group is vegetarian. We have common gardens, a workshop, children's areas, guest room, TV/video room, and the like. We enjoy working and playing together. We lack a common ideology other than wanting to live this type of lifestyle. Our children love living at Cascade Cohousing.

Contact the community and arrange a date/time to visit. We do not have fixed visiting times or days. We welcome visitors subject to a host being available to meet the visitor.

Whole Village is located on 191 acres near Orangeville, Ontario. Most of the members live on the farm in Greenhaven, our eco-residence. Whole Village members pledge to operate a biodynamic farm as an integral part of the community and to achieve these goals consistent with principles of sustainable land stewardship.

We are an ecologically sustainable and environmentally sensitive community. We protect and enhance the natural habitat through a system of land stewardship embracing the unique geographical, historical, cultural, and biological attributes of the land.

Whole Village is intended to be a solution for two difficult problems: the steady loss of farmland to urbanization and the devastating effects of low commodity prices on farmers and the rural communities that they belong to. Through a comprehensive conservation easement, all of the WV property, except for the compact housing cluster, is preserved for 999 years as farmland, managed forest, or natural areas.

Starland is a campground/retreat center located in a Southern California high desert setting near Joshua Tree. It is run by a resident and non-resident community. Residents live in their own trailers or cabins and share common facilities. 

Our facilities are available for group retreats, workshops or other events as well as for individual visitors. We are located on 10 scenic and private acres. Facilities include a 27’X36′ assembly hall, a lodge house with a kitchen, dining room, lounge, sleeping room and rest rooms, a large outdoor dining patio, a hot tub, labyrinth, shower building, dome, hiking trails, several cabins and trailers and ample space for tents and RV’s. Most of the property could be clothing-optional. For larger events, the adjoining property can be available, which consists of a large 2 bedroom 2 bath house on 3 acres with full RV hookups and a 600 square foot garage which can be used as an additional activity space. We are ideal for events with 20-50 participants.

We serve as a Southern California home base for Network for a New Culture, Radical Faeries, Burning Man and other groups and organizations. We are affiliated with the Shadow Mountain Cohousing community in nearby Joshua Tree.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22167&quot;&gt;Teaching Drum Outdoor School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Native-Earth balanced lifeway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/teaching-drum-outdoor-school/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/teaching-drum-outdoor-school/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a community dedicated to preserving and sharing the skills and ways of our tribal ancestors, honoring the Old Ways of clan living in balance with our relations. We use the vital tools of truth-speaking, pattern-breaking, awareness and attunement exercises, threaded through with the basics like honor, respect. The talking circle is our forum. The wild herbs are our healers. The Earth is our Mother. All the creatures of the land are our guides. 

Our primitive camp, Nishnajida--a cluster of bark-and-thatch wigwams--lies five miles from our office center. There, we guide the yearlong Wilderness Guide Program where students from all over the world come to make their clothing from skins; fish and forage for food; make craft items like bows, bowls, spoons, baskets; learn how to track, how to build, inhabit, and maintain lodges.  Most of all, students learn about themselves and how to genuinely live as a clan. Everyone in our community is involved with the maintenance of this program, as well as with our own personal projects, passions, and growth. 

A second primitive camp, Mashkodens, is our living-learning center where experienced staff members live and Wilderness Guide Program graduates come for extended internships in native lifeway. Mashkodens serves as a doorway where people from all over can come to experience the Old Way as it is actually lived in our contemporary context, for one to three months at a time. 

Walking in the footsteps of the natives who were here before us, our programs are semi-nomadic, with winter and summer lodges at our primitive camps and temporary seasonal camps for activities such as fishing, wild ricing, and leek-gathering at various locations. Those at our support/office/administrative center join in these seasonal activities as well. 

At the support center we live in wood-stove heated cabins, use electricity, computers, cars, and telephones, but our approach is to live as simply and closely to the Earth Mother as possible. Many of us do not use indoor toilets, and we have limited bathing facilities, but we do have running water in a couple of our homes. We purchase local organic food, scavenge and fish for our wild meat, and forage for some of our summer fruits and greens, and nuts.  

Information about open positions, volunteer opportunities, internships, classes, and the Wilderness Guide Program are available from our website. 

We are a pet-free, alcohol/tobacco/drug-free community.</description>

Hummingbird Community is located on 500 acres of lush land nestled against the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of northern New Mexico. We began as a non-local community within Global Family bonding through our extensive international peace and educational work. Global Family, founded in 1986, is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization affiliated with the United Nations whose purpose is to support a shift in consciousness from separation and fear to unity, love, and cooperation.

As social pioneers, we share a commitment to the principles and practices of co-creation. Since founding Hummingbird in 1996, we have grown into a diverse group of 22 deeply connected core members who support one another in fulfilling each of our souls’ purpose.

Hummingbird Community is one of four primary aspects of our overarching organization, the Hummingbird Center for a Co-Creative World (www.hummingbirdcenterforacocreativeworld.com):
- Global Family
An international network of individuals and groups who choose to experience themselves as members of one human family and who desire to actualize their life purpose through joining with others in compassionate action for the benefit of all.
- Hummingbird Community
As social pioneers, our Community is dedicated to the practices and principles of co-creation in service to the evolution of consciousness. We honor diverse spiritual traditions, and are committed to personal and planetary transformation. 
- Hummingbird Living School
The educational programs of HBLS are designed to give people the understanding, information and skills necessary to be a leader in the pioneering adventure of bringing forth a profoundly healthy and loving world.

A premier wellness center for those who desire a renewed sense of wellbeing and balance. We value personal relationships, emotions, beliefs, meanings and the connections these have to the body, mind, spirit and all of humanity. 

We invite others to join us in our living laboratory of discovery where Source and Nature guide us to co-create a new world.

Molino Creek LLC has two major goals: to foster community through shared land ownership and to operate an organic farm on our parcel in Santa Cruz county. 

There are nine separate household shareholders, comprised of one or two adults and their children. Some members work on the farm, some work in nearby Santa Cruz in a variety of occupations, some are retired.

Our group uses consensus to make all decisions. We meet regularly (once or twice a month) to discuss management of collective affairs.

The property is &quot;off the grid&quot; with no incoming utilities. Each household satisfies its power needs with photovoltaics/generators. Each member contributes money to maintain the five-mile road that connects us to the Coast Highway.

All residents at Molino Creek are shareholders; we do not have facilities for guests. Each share owns a 1/9 undivided interest in the common property. A share entitles a household to make certain improvements on the property, participate in the consensus process, and be part of the co-owned farm operation.</description>

Oak Spirit Sanctuary is a church of Shamanic Wicca and nature sanctuary. We provide access to Nature, a safe place for outdoor worship in an earth-centered, earth honoring spiritual context, promoting community among persons of these beliefs. Our practices include environmentalism, appreciation for nature spirits, honor of the earth, and community building. Our primary outreach is operating a Pagan land sanctuary and spiritual retreat center. We offer a variety of educational opportunities from basics to clergy training. Our Land Management is done from an environmental, magickal, and spiritual perspective.

OSS Faith Statement:

OSS Shamanic Wicca venerates Divine as God and Goddess manifested in Nature by celebrating the cycles of the seasons in the Wheel of the Year, Sabbats, Phases of the Moon, and Esbats, in an eclectic fashion honoring the Masculine and the Feminine in all Their aspects. We believe Nature is a manifestation of God and Goddess as immanence and continuous creation, thus human kind is related to and not set above, all other life. We follow the Three-Fold-Law and the Wiccan Rede. By embracing personal responsibility, we profess our interconnections with all life. This is expressed by stewardship of the Earth, respect for all life, and each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ozark-avalon/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ozark-avalon/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Oak Spirit Sanctuary is a church of Shamanic Wicca , focused on work with spirits of Nature drawing from a variety of traditional earth centered religious and magickal systems. Our rituals are classic Wiccan with Celtic, Native American, Faerie, Norse, and other practices utilizing classical energy work. Open worship circles are held each month, usually the weekend closest to the full or new moon. These are free. All are welcome. We also host Sabbat Festivals with the traditional Wheel of the Year. These feature workshops, entertainment, and spiritual celebration based on the seasonal theme. These have a small attendance fee for the maintenance of the church and land. All are welcome to attend free monthly Lunar events and or Sabbat Festivals.

We are a cooperative, open to anyone willing to accept the responsibilities of membership. Responsibilities are based upon the efficient management of our housing in accordance with the mutual benefits of the community. We impose no restrictive rules/codes/ideologies/belief systems at all upon ourselves other than the obvious liberating ones of respect for one another and the environment, paying one's fair share of the costs, and the development and maintenance of collective responsibility. Our structure is as close to a direct democracy as one can find anywhere on the planet. We are active in the support and promotion of co-ops, including the initiating and setting up of the national housing-cooperative representative body. We have recently completed the electronic networking of all our properties with Apple Macintoshes and are presently working toward the greening of our properties.

Our members come from every part of the country and range in age from small children to senior citizens. Our interests are broad, and our consensus form of management includes committees to oversee all phases of development and Solterra social life. 

We share meals most Sunday and Tuesday evenings. Eating choices vary from meat-eating to vegan, and our common meals reflect this. There are 38 resident families currently.</description>

Gaia Argentina is a pioneer ecovillage project with permaculture basis, in development since 1996, in a rural area 120km from Buenos Aires.
Gaia functions as a living and learning center, and has been sharing information and inspiration for permaculture projects and ecovillage development in the southern region and farther. We offer courses on permaculture, natural building, ecovillage design, circle dances, aromatherapy, and more.
Gaia hosted in March 2000 the first Latin-American Permaculture Convergence with great success. We created the Permaculture Popular University (UPP) as a space for experimenting, implementing, and teaching permaculture systems. UPP focuses on research and practice of appropriate technologies adapted for the local needs, to transfer them to impoverished people in our country. New members are participating in the project in many different ways.

We are a unique, small community located just outside Minneapolis near lakes and shopping. We value diversity, and have varying incomes. Our 15 households currently include people of ages 5 through 70, singles and couples, with and without children.  

Occupations include computer programmers, artists, teachers, therapists, caregivers, scientists, architect, piano teacher, executive director, gardener, and more. Our traditions include parties, campfires, sing-alongs, game nights, house concerts, benefit auction, solstice celebration, etc. Community meals and “co-chats” (spontaneous conversations) are the glue that hold the community together. We self-manage, and value working together.

The community has an abundance of common space, including a large living room, library, kitchen, dining room, three-season porch, four working fireplaces, exercise room, wood shop, laundry room, children's playroom, and office.  Outdoor common space includes lawns with picnic areas, a play area, a vegetable garden, and an acre of woods. The grounds are lovingly landscaped; we often see deer and wild turkeys roaming through our property.

Homes include eight retrofit co-op apartments in an Edwardian mansion and seven townhomes built for the community.  The two buildings are connected by a tunnel, which removes the weather as an obstacle to getting together.  Home size ranges roughly from 400 to 1600 sq ft. 

Our community grows from working together and shared experience.

Marsh Commons site is a reused industrial property adjacent to a wildlife sanctuary and marsh with many miles of walking trails. We chose this site for its location close to the town plaza and to a beautiful wild place.

Our houses and common house feature sustainable materials, including carpet from pop bottles, redwood from an old barn we tore down, reused lighting, flooring resawn from old mill buildings, recycled-newspaper insulation, sustainably harvested construction lumber, and recycled-plastic lumber for decking.

We have weekly meals, celebrate together, have a vegetable garden, and respect each others individuality.

Houses to buy and rentals become available intermittently.

We are committed to the creation and maintenance of a supportive, enriching, and purposeful community that fosters connection amongst ourselves, others, and the Earth through simplicity, cooperation, and community service.


About Us:
Liberty Village is just outside of Frederick, Maryland amongst sprawling open landscape and farmland.  We are located in Libertytown, Maryland which is a peacefully small town with less than 1000 residents and we love being so close to suburbia yet so nicely tucked into a little corner of idyllic cohousing life here.  

Our village was founded upon the vision of creating a multigenerational living environment that promotes a strong sense of community and a deep-founded respect for our Mother Earth.  Residents are committed to interacting with and knowing their neighbors in a meaningful way.  Here, different traditions and values are respected, and all can feel that they belong as our residents have diverse backgrounds, occupations, politics, family situations, spiritual/secular paths, and sexual orientations/identities.  

We are compromised of growing families (currently 20+ children), retirees, singles, and young couples.  In the 20 years Liberty Village has been in existence, residents have come and gone, and we have seen many births, deaths, weddings, and so many more life changes.  Still,  LV continues to be a work in progress so that as our lives evolve and circumstances change, so does the patchwork quilt of the community. We remain a community dedicated to creating a place where resources are shared, the Earth is respected, and our children play together in safety.

Homes are clustered on 8 of our total 23 acres around a green, pedestrian-only footpath.  Yes, that means your kiddos are safe their bike, scooter, wagon anywhere they please (and trust me, they do!)

Our remaining 15 acres of land contain a mix of community gardens, an abundant fruit orchard with pear, apple, and cherry trees alongside blueberry bushes, meadows, woodlands, and wetlands. We have a quiet meditation area in the &quot;way back&quot; for anyone wanting a break or the perfect place to camp and make a small fire for the evening.  We forage on wild blackberries, along with red and black raspberries several months through the year.  Often we enjoy impromptu dance parties, game nights, s'mores nights,  guitar jam sessions, movie nights, and lots of camaraderie with our neighbors and friends.

There are free-range, organic pastured chickens which supply us with endless fresh eggs daily, milking goats that supply us with endless entertainment along with fresh milk and cheese, and we hope to add an apiary in the Spring of 2019!


We have 10 lots which READY TO BUILD your custom home with new, smaller floor plans for those wanting to downsize and simplify.  We would love to meet you and show you what makes us amazing!

You can find us on Facebook for the most up to date photographs (We welcome your comments, likes and shares so keep them coming!) and on our website (www.libertyvillage.com) for upcoming calendar events!</description>

Eno Commons is a community of 22 houses clustered together on 11 acres in Durham, North Carolina. Our homes are either 1483 or 1974 square feet, with passive solar design and energy efficient geo-thermal heating and cooling. Homes are individually owned, but we share a common house (and common meals once or twice a week), a workshop, a playground, an organic vegetable garden, and lots of green space. We have neighbors at a variety of ages and stages, with lots of opportunity for socializing, project work, and community building.

We are committed to creating a neighborly and cooperative community in which we know and care about one another. Children can play safely, surrounded by neighbors, and residents know that caring friends are close by. We are committed to the vitality, convenience, and diversity that is Cambridge.

Blueberry Hill is a cohousing community of 19 houses in Northern Virginia, 20 miles from the District of Columbia. We are closely connected to the vegetable farm next door -- the farmers instigated the community and several of the family members live at Blueberry Hill. We are self-developed, and the first cohousing community in Fairfax County. We own a Common House together (where we eat two to three times a week, not including parties) and we maintain our commonly owned outdoor spaces. Our membership is diverse--in age, race, profession, place of origin, family size, and religious affiliation. We strive to maintain our relationships by working together on community projects, eating together often, meeting as a full group once a month, and having parties.  Better still, our car-less greenway between the houses offers many opportunities for chance meetings.  We also celebrate and honor significant events in the lives of our members and respond to expressed needs for help or support of various sorts.

It is North America's 50th Cohousing community, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is an award-winning innovative mixed-used historic-preservation project, restoring an abandoned old market building. 

In addition to our Cohousing community, Swan's Market includes affordable rental apartments, retail stores, restaurants, professional offices, public courtyard and is the former home of the Museum of Children’s Art.

All the traditional components of Cohousing are active here, including common meals 3x/week, monthly work parties, and neighbors helping neighbors. Participation and engagement in the community is high, with residents sharing food from our community garden, tools, time, friendship, resources, and skills. Located in the heart of thriving Old Oakland, Swan's Market Cohousing is 2 blocks from BART, 15 minutes from downtown San Francisco or downtown Berkeley by BART, has a Walkability Score of 98/100 and just about every service you can imagine within a few blocks, including the Farmers Market on Washington &amp;amp; 9th Streets each Friday. Though urban, our outdoor space – “Swan's Way” – is generously planted with fruit trees, vegetables, and artful patio gardens. Our outdoor table is a community gathering spot.

Community amenities include a 3,500 square foot common house with large kitchen and dining area, kids’ play room, exercise room, laundry, workshop, community garden, guest room, large patio for dining/entertaining.   We value our three community meals a week and residents commit to participating in cooking rotations, as well as additional tasks necessary to support the maintenance and self-management of our community.</description>

The Nazir Order of the Purple Veil.
Blessings and Thanks to our Spiritual Teacher, Founder and Director of Nahziryah Monastic Community, Retreat for Meditation and Wholistic Living, Monastic EcoVillage, The Community of The Purple Lodge, The Nazir Order Of The Purple Veil, In The Degree Of The Ascension – The Reverend Nazirmoreh(ABRD). Rev. Nazirmoreh(All Blessings and Respect Due), is our spiritual teacher and guide. Rev. Nazirmoreh(ABRD) teaches that there are many paths--one goal, many names-one Divine Creator. The Nazir community is monastic, abiding by rules, order, and disciplines. The monastery includes men, women, and children. Resident members live a simple, monastic, communal life- we work hard, meditate, study, and strive daily to overcome the lower ego.
At the monastery,the monastic village; Nahziryah Monastic Community, Retreat for Meditation and Wholistic Living, the resident members do organic gardening to help sustain the community's dietary needs (vegan). To support the community and the effort toward consciousness expansion and further spiritual development, we make and sell art crafts, as well as metaphysical/esoteric/spiritual literature of all faiths, recordings, essential and essence oils, incense, and meditation supplies.
Nahziryah Monastic Community sustains itself through its own laborious efforts, except for the occasional donations given by the few who are sympathetic with the Nazir way of life and are willing and able to help, financially and otherwise, to support the service. The NMC Retreat for Meditation &amp; Wholistic Living is dedicated to providing living space in a natural environment for students of the Baba who choose the monastic life. The Nazir path is for those who hear the call and come to give their All in All in the service of consciousness expansion &amp; further spiritual development of all. Behold the One in All.

Next Step Integral, formerly Morning Star Community, is an integral* community founded in 1992.

We are an international body of individuals touched at a core level by a call to come together in service to the work of consciousness evolution. As we deepen our understanding of the next step in consciousness evolution, we place a primary focus on actually applying our discoveries to our lives. We are awed, fascinated, and humbled by the potential breadth and depth of human life. We are aware of a real need for integral examples of life to find expression here and now on earth. Our main emphases are personal and global transformation, research, education, collective intelligence, and networking.

Our vision is that we become a living body that will continue to grow and evolve. We seek to respond wholeheartedly, seriously, and joyously to the predicament of our times—to listen to the whisperings of Spirit that invite us to full Union, to communion, where the One and the Many are present and alive.

The vision of Next Step Integral arises from the knowledge that a quantum leap in consciousness is possible and necessary—one that will balance our awakened authentic individual self with the communion that is inherently possible between humans.

* integral: derived from “integrate,” to bring together, to join, to link, to embrace—not in the sense of uniformity, but in the sense of unity-in-diversity.
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22188&quot;&gt;Greater World Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; to build and inhabit an Earthship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/greater-world-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/greater-world-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Greater World Community is the world's first Earthship subdivision.  Located 15 minutes from historic Taos, New Mexico, the Greater World Community is 634 acres of rolling mesa with great views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and the town of Taos. Two and a half miles of the community front New Mexico State Highway 64 W. Lots of varying sizes are available in all phases of this development.  

The Gravel Pit Reclamation Project (AKA Lemuria) in the Greater World Community is located in the northeastern portion of the subdivision. By combining the Earthship's innovative water-catch-and-reuse systems with permaculture techniques to trap and direct surface-water runoff, the Gravel Pit Reclamation Project will demonstrate how to rejuvenate and reclaim a formerly worthless piece of discarded land.

Residents of the Greater World enjoy access to 347 acres of community land, open green space with hiking, biking, and parks. There will be a community center built on community land with sports facilities and playground. Greater World members also have access to backup water from the solar-powered community well.

The Earthship homes are the common element in the Greater World community. They continue to evolve each time one is built. No power, water, gas, or sewage lines enter or leave the property. Earthships produce their own power with photovoltaics and wind generators. They catch their own water, use it, and then treat and reuse it several times. The only outside utility most homes have is a propane tank (used primarily for cooking but also for heating water). 

We think Earthships are the way of the future, a way to tread more lightly on the earth we share.

Light of Freedom is located near the beautiful Blue Ridge Parkway in southern Virginia. It is a place for inner peace, and dedicated to healing through relationships. In Oneness, we see our equality. Everyone has their own chosen work and interests including horticulture, healing arts, crafts,architecture, aquaculture, and writing, on land owned by the community. 

Light of Freedom is developing the “Caregivers Society” an organization that brings caregivers together for education, training, support group, and placement.  We are creating a Caregiver List of qualified caregivers for the community to draw upon.  We recognize that everyone is a caregiver in some form.  We also recognize that non of us have been trained for this job.  Our purpose is to fill that void.  For more information you can contact.

Some individuals live in the community house and others build their own sustainable homestead. Alternative building methods are strongly encouraged. We prefer to catch and use the sun, wind, water, and earth given us, returning them naturally to the life cycle with zero pollution. Our first house produces its own electric power from the sun and wind, was built from sawmill poplar, and has an earth roof which demonstrates a sustainable life style. We maintain our quiet enjoyment of organic gardening, ponds, and orchard with future.

We give workshops and classes on “A Course in Miracles,” alternative building methods, and renewable energy systems. We meet as a community monthly where decisions are made by 100 % consensus. Meetings begin with our acknowledgment of peace as our one goal, and in peace, understanding comes, allowing us to perceive solutions to community problems. We recognize we share one spirit and one life, and all decisions are given to Spirit for guidance, directions, and resolution. We want to build a council center, and welcome any help in that direction.  

For our community, living by the &quot;golden rule&quot; is to perceive in others what you would have them perceive in you. Our vision at Light of Freedom is, and will be, a happy gathering of equals. We welcome visitors; call or write for directions and availability of accommodations.

      <name>Kalani Oceanside Retreat</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22190&quot;&gt;Kalani Oceanside Retreat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Kalani was founded by two professional artists, Earnest Morgan and Richard Koob, MFA, former Hawai'i State Arts Coordinators, and University of Hawai'i instructors versed in dance, drama, painting, drawing, music, Hawaiian, African, Asian and European cultural arts, and yoga. Since Kalani's beginning in 1975, many culture and arts forms have been and continue to be celebrated in the annual and weekly ongoing events.

Kalani's property was at one time a traditional ahupua'a, or land portion, that was cared for by an `ohana, or extended family, who benefited from its stewardship. A halau, or Hawaiian cultural school, graced the ocean frontage of Kalani until 1900. This site, with its paths, lava walls and smooth stone floor, is preserved along with a heiau (temple) site and burial grounds.

In the 1870's, Hawaii's beloved monarch, Kalākaua, reinstated the practice of hula after years of suppression from the missionaries. A renaissance of Hawaiian culture has continued ever since, celebrated annually in Hilo's Merrie Monarch Festival, during which Kalani holds the Puna Music Festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kalani-oceanside-retreat/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kalani-oceanside-retreat/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Kalani is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational retreat center and eco-community in Hawai‘i Island’s colorful Puna District, and a premiere destination for over 40 years. Kalani hosts individual retreats, group workshops, sabbatical, and community life experiences in on-site accommodations that range from off-grid campsites to eco-cottages constructed from sustainably harvested wood and bamboo.

Kalani is great for year-round personal getaways or group retreats (up to 125)! Kalani is the only coastal lodging facility within the Aloha State's largest conservation area.

One of Kalani’s guiding principles is to preserve and enhance our pristine, 120-acre campus and surrounding Puna District through sustainable education programs and hands-on community participation. To that end, Kalani has become a living model for discovering and implementing best practices in permaculture, sustainability, and community development in a breathtaking tropical oasis. For all the latest happenings on our lively campus, check out our Blog or follow us on Facebook and Instagram!

Nearby are thermal springs, a black sand beach visited by dolphins and whales, orchid farms, snorkel tidal pools, steam bathing, waterfalls, botanical gardens, historic villages, and spectacular Volcanoes National Park.

Kalani is expanding its facilities beginning in 2007 and is accepting a limited number of new investors and residents.

Maison Emmanuel,  is an intentional, life-sharing community based on Anthroposophy, and modeled on the Camphill Communities existing worldwide. We are approximately 50 people (including 24  adolescents and adults in need of special care) living and working together in the beautiful Laurentian mountains, 100 km (60 miles) north of Montreal.

House parents, together with their children and young coworkers live in family-like settings. The rhythmic structure of the household, school, workshops (bakery, candle-making, small farm, garden, weaving, pottery, woodwork), and therapies creates the warm, supportive environment of community living. Shared meals, seasonal festivals, plays, birthday celebrations and outings, help create bonds of friendship and responsibility where everyone learns to care and provide for the needs of the others.

A program of expansion and integration has started in the center of a nearby town with one adult residence and our bakery with a boutique for Maison Emmanuel's crafts.
Training for new coworkers and a foundation course is provided. Many people from different countries live at Maison Emmanuel. The languages spoken within the community are approximately two-thirds English and one-third French. The surrounding community speaks mostly French.

We deepen our spiritual path through direct experience and eat, dance, and pray together. The community, begun in June 1995, is a retreat center, a nature preserve, and a residential village on 1,500 acres along year-round Bear Creek.  We host group and individual retreats with inclusive spiritual themes.

People interested in residency at the Southwest Sufi Community want to have the pioneer spirit, be financially self-sufficient or resourceful, and in good health. Since the land is remote from town, it is not practical to commute. People will need to support themselves in creative ways. Those interested in establishing cottage industries on the land are especially encouraged to come and check us out.

The best way to get to know the community is to come for a visit, or attend one of our camps or retreats We offer limited indoor accommodations, camping, vegetarian meals, classes, and time in nature. We welcome visitors at other times, too, especially on weekends. Please write or email before planning a visit and tell us you saw this listing in the Communities Directory.

We are an egalitarian, humanitarian commune living as ecologically as possible with the land. The community started in Lower Bavaria in 1975 and moved to Central Italy in 1982. Many of the founding members came out of the Movement of the 1960s. There are 20 adults and five children living in three houses on 92 hectares of hilly land. A large flock of sheep provides the basis for commercial cheese production. We keep horses and poultry, and some of the activities we are engaged in are horticulture, colouring of textiles with natural colours, pottery, and other handicrafts. Our monetary income we obtain predominantly working as artisans and in the service sector outside of the community. We have stopped to receive visitors with a general interest in communal living.

The first families came to live in the village in 1977. By 2018, 70 families had settled there. In the coming years, the population is expected to reach 150 families. 

The members of Wahat al-Salam/Neve Shalom are demonstrating the possibility of coexistence between Jews and Palestinians by developing a community based on mutual acceptance, respect, and cooperation. Democratically governed and owned by its members, the community is not affiliated with any political party or movement. 

Wahat al-Salam/Neve Shalom gives practical expression to its vision through its various branches:

•	The bilingual, bicultural school and kindergarten, founded in 1984, educate more than 270 children from the area, and works to establish this form of education as a viable model. 
•	The School for Peace, founded in 1979, conducts courses and seminars for Arab and Jewish youth and adults in Israel and from the Palestinian Authority.
•	The Pluralistic Spiritual Community Center provides activities exploring the religious, cultural and spiritual dimensions of peace..

Our core values and vision help to provide a common foundation for our decisions and our relationships with each other.

Around 95 people live at Sunward Cohousing, from wee ones to octogenarians. We have singles and couples, families and empty-nesters, and at least one household that functions as a cooperative. We have a diversity of backgrounds, occupations, spiritual and secular paths, and sexual orientations.

In our years together on the land since 1998, we have experienced births, deaths, weddings, partings, members joining and departing, and much more. Many of us were drawn to Sunward for the sense of community and for the opportunity to live more lightly on the land.  We steward 20 beautiful acres of woods, prairie, ponds, one quarter of which contains our clustered private homes and common house.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22196&quot;&gt;The Commons on the Alameda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Enjoying and building multigenerational sustainable community together.

The vision of the Commons on the Alameda is to enrich our lives through a shared intention to cultivate positive interactions within a mutigenerational co-housing community; to encourage social and ecological responsibility; to draw upon our talents, resources and ideas; to strengthen our connections; to share in meals, service and celebration; to build and sustain our community and to design the buildings and grounds to reflect our commitment to work together harmoniously as neighbors, balancing needs for privacy with those for relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-commons-on-the-alameda/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-commons-on-the-alameda/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
The Commons on the Alameda is a pueblo-style cohousing community on 4.5 acres at the edge of the city of Santa Fe. Construction began in 1991 and the last homes were completed in 1997. Our common house is adjacent to our main plaza.   Our 28 homes cluster around four beautifully landscaped smaller courtyards that we call &quot;placitas&quot;. 
We eat communal organic meals on Mondays and Thursdays using local and organic produce as much as possible. Residents participate in the cooking and cleaning up for one meal per month; the remainder of their eight hour per month service commitment involves various endeavors including landscape maintenance, newsletter production, and childcare. Committee chairs (kitchen, guest room, grounds, etc) orchestrate much of the nitty-gritty. We have two community meetings per month--one to discuss and make consensus-based decisions regarding business items and the other to share on a more personal level. Every fall we host our community celebration for the greater community with tree planting, cider making, entertainment, green chili stew, and dancing. We have an orchard area with a chicken coop, fire circle, and a basketball hoop.  
Several residents have home businesses.  Many of our homeowners have rental rooms or efficiency units available. The community has three rooms available for guests of residents.  We have about eighty residents, with approximately 25% of residents being children. The community remains focused on youngsters with cooperative childcare that provides childcare for meeting times and other community events. There are also play areas throughout the property.

Greyrock Commons is located on 16 acres of land about three miles northwest of &quot;Old Town&quot; Fort Collins, Colorado. A cohousing community, Greyrock includes 30 energy efficient townhomes of various sizes clustered on six acres, each with its own small private yard or garden. The remaining 10 acres include a community garden, chicken coop and yard, sheds, a natural area, fruit trees, and beehives.

As we began our planning process, we developed this mission statement:
We are a group of people seeking to build a cohesive, cooperative community based on respect, responsibility, and shared human and material resources.
We encourage and accept a diverse membership, representing a variety of ages, professional, family structure, and ethnic, cultural, and spiritual backgrounds.
We understand that building community is a fluid, evolving process to which each of us contributes. As we move along this path, we expect course corrections and value learning from our missteps.
We are dedicated to consensus decision making.
We value living lightly on the earth and pledge the wise use of our natural resources. We also value a sense of family with each other and relationship with the larger community, a safe environment for growing and learning, and privacy balanced with cooperative living.
We therefore join together to create, nurture, and sustain a cohousing community in Fort Collins, Colorado.

We are the stewards and human inhabitants of 90 acres of hilly and diverse land nestled in a bend of a river in the Blue Ridge Mountains. We're 28 miles from a state university, an hour from a small city with an airport, and five minutes from a small but culturally diverse town of about 500. 
 We have 70 acres in a Virginia Conservation Land Trust to protect the land. We continue to work on our land plan and guidelines to care for the environment as we build our dreams together. 
 We are committed to living thoughtfully--with beauty, economy, conviviality, and care. We love this land where we live and try to treat it well. We study and practice environmentally sound building methods, use composting or low water use toilets, and in one building area have a constructed wetland for our gray water treatment. We eat together regularly, help each other out, and enjoy each others company.
While our adult members currently include single, partnered, and married individuals, we welcome diversity of lifestyle. We strive to listen to each other as we make consensus decisions and live closely. While we have no unified spiritual path, we strive to honor different expressions of spirituality as a way to honor our diversity as individuals. We enjoy celebrations of many kinds of special days each year including Thanksgiving and the Solstices.
We share community expenses.

To achieve this vision, ICC Austin provides affordable housing to students, on a cooperative basis, in an environment that enhances member education, encourages the formation of long lasting communities, and fosters responsible citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/inter-cooperative-council-icc-texas/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/inter-cooperative-council-icc-texas/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Established in 1937 and incorporated in 1970, ICC Austin is a nonprofit student housing cooperative located in central Austin. Student members share the responsibility and benefits of operating our nine co-op houses, while our professional staff maintains a central office. Houses run democratically, and members do all the work to run our houses--cooking, cleaning, etc.--spending four to six hours per member per week on these tasks.

Our houses are walking distance to the University of Texas and house 15 to 31 students each. We offer several vegetarian and upper-division houses and theme houses as well. Our programs and services are aimed to increase access to college education, and we operate as a nonprofit.

Members enjoy being part of local co-op community, and we are active members of NASCO, the federation of student co-ops.

We live in a large old house in the rolling Devon hills. Accommodation is both rented and leasehold, in converted outbuildings and in the main house. On our seven acres of land we grow organic fruit and vegetables. We have a paddock with sheep and chickens, an orchard, a vineyard, a walled garden, a swimming pool, compost toilets, and a reed-bed sewage system. Together we run a course center and spend the income on community projects. We share responsibility for our home and the land on which we live. We have shared meals most evenings and at least 20 birthdays a year (cake, candles, and song). We participate in the wider community, promoting awareness of everyone's impact on the environment, through the local recycling scheme and community-open days. Individuals earn their income in the wider world in journalism, education, recycling, complementary health and alternative ceremonies; some work from home. We do not want our community to be a place of dogmatism, judgment, or preaching. We value our diversity and flexibility. We aim to care for one another and enjoy life as it happens. We welcome each other's differences and enjoy visitors and volunteers.

This cooperative neighborhood on a gorgeous old farmstead in central Vermont was established by a group of friends who met in the early 1980s while working together in regional antinuclear, feminist, and disarmament coalitions. Initially we gathered as an informal study group to learn about land trusts and collective living. We spoke with people who had lived in communes and collectives and began to explore alternative legal and financial structures with a lawyer who specializes in cooperatives and worker-owned businesses. Our goal was simplicity, fairness, and flexibility. Being a cooperative has been important to all of us, because membership and governance rights and responsibilities are defined as the same. We've made every decision in more than thirty years by consensus. Our main shared projects presently is woodland stewardship. We are not seeking new members because for now we've found a size that seems just right.

The Santa Barbara Student Housing Cooperative (SBSHC) provides students democratic control, community ownership, safe, inexpensive housing, and greater social interaction. A wide range of students from a variety of backgrounds and countries are attracted to our student housing co-ops. We own four group houses and one apartment building located near the University of California, Santa Barbara campus.
SBSHC has an open membership policy. Not only do we not discriminate in any way, but we actively encourage diversity among our groups in order to stimulate education and awareness.
Members must attend house meetings every two weeks and fulfill the Service Requirement every quarter, in addition to normal house chores and maintenance. Members own and operate the co-op. Rent charges reflect the costs of running and maintaining the co-ops. No profits are made; income goes toward paying off loans as well as paying staff salaries, with surplus earnings being reinvested in the buildings, the residents, and further co-op expansion. A portion of the budget is assigned to member project grants, education programs and workshops.
SBSHC is committed to environmentally responsible living. We are also affiliated with the North American Students of Cooperative Organization (NASCO).

Zephyr Valley Community Cooperative is a rural housing intentional community of six families living in southeastern Minnesota on 500 acres of stunningly beautiful land in the hill country. We welcome beginning farmers and homesteaders who are interested in a cooperative kind of living and who could join us in “building community, nurturing the land”.  Housing and building sites available. Decisions about the land and community are made by consensus, all other decisions are individual ones.

 The land, bought by the Coop in 1994, has hundreds of acres of restored wetlands, pastures, woodland, bluff lands, high grass meadows, ponds, creeks and a trout stream. It's a great place for children to grow up with an intimate knowledge of the natural world.

  80 acres of land are farmed organically, currently in pasture &amp;amp; prairie flower plantings.

  There are six individual homes and one under construction which is available for sale. Homes occasionally are available for rent.  We have two barns and several outbuildings.

  We have a community center (for community meals, parties, meetings, guests, etc.) as well as a spring-fed swimming pond, a soccer/baseball field, and trails for walking and skiing.
 
  Winona, Rushford, and La Crosse are all within a 30-minute drive, bringing you five college campuses, an arts community, and a family-friendly environment.

  This is a wonderful place to live, whether you’re interested in small-scale, organic farming or just in living in a rural community.

Highline Crossing began forming in 1991 and our community-designed homes were completed in stages between 1995 and 1997. 

20+ years have given us time for the trees to grow and for us to grow some of our own traditions. We have put our own spin on an eclectic mix of holiday and celebratory events like our annual OktoberFest, St. Patrick's Day, and Christmas Eve dinners, our annual Art &amp; Talent Show, and more. Regular events include community meals or potlucks, workdays throughout the year, and of course, community and team meetings! 

We are devoted to the principles of participation, shared decision-making, and the development of respectful relationships with our neighbors. We are also dedicated to sustainability - environmental and  human. Highline Crossing combines some of the best features of urban living with an old-fashioned sense of neighborhood

Amenities include a community garden with individual garden plots, common gathering areas, and guest quarters in the Common House. 

Highline Crossing also offers immediate access to the Highline Canal Trail system (over 70 miles of foot/bike/horse trails, just across a footbridge). There is a wide variety of cultural and sporting activities locally. The community is less than a mile from the light-rail system with easy access to downtown Denver.

A river flows through this beautiful location, which features a network of trails and scenic overlooks. With a friendly staff to help guests enjoy their stay, we offer a rare opportunity for visitors to experience spiritual rest and relaxation in a supportive and nourishing environment.

We are also blessed with the growing Clear Light Community, which is populated by full-time residents who have chosen to build homes here and grow with us at Song of the Morning.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22208&quot;&gt;N Street Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; sharing resources. meals, etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/n-street-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/n-street-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
N Street is a cohousing community that was started in 1986 when two tract homes built in the early 1950s took down their side fences. We started using a garage as a common house in 1988 after reading Cohousing: A Contemporary Approach to Housing Ourselves by Mccamant and Durrett.  

&quot;N&quot; Street continues to grow slowly, adding one house at a time. We currently have expanded to 20 houses, 13 homes on &quot;N&quot; Street that back up to 7 homes on the adjacent street. (Two of the homes on N Street are across the street from the community but are occupied by active members.) The removal of fences has created a beautiful open-space area that includes vegetable, flower gardens; a play structure; a hot tub; chicken coop, large grassy area, pond, and more.

We enjoy sharing community meals in our newly rebuilt common house three to four times per week and work parties once a month. We have a rich set of traditions including coming of age ceremonies.  We are a mixed community of half renters and half homeowners of around 11 kids and 50 adults. 

We make decisions by consensus with everyone having an equal ability to participate after having lived in the community for three months and having attended three meetings.  We use a modified consensus where a 75% super majority can vote if consensus cannot be reached after six meetings and three months of effort have passed. So far, we have never gone through that whole process to a vote.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22209&quot;&gt;Oberlin Student Cooperative Association (OSCA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To promote and develop cooperative living at Oberlin College in accordance with the Rochdale Cooperative principles so long as such activity is not inconsistent with the fundamental principles and policies of Oberlin College.  To buy and acquire food and other supplies for the rooming, dining, living and studying of student members attending Oberlin College to be sold to them at actual cost.  To arrange and provide for the social and cultural enrichment of its members at actual cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/oberlin-student-cooperative-association-osca/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/oberlin-student-cooperative-association-osca/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Oberlin Student Cooperative Association (OSCA) is an association of eight self-managed student-run housing and dining cooperatives at Oberlin College.

OSCA, est. 1950, is a unique co-op in that it houses and feeds 174 student owners and feeds an additional 441 student owners in dining facilities, saving its members thousands of dollars per year from the regular campus housing and dining rates. Individual houses are self-managed, and decisions for the association are made democratically, with representation from all of the individual units. Some decisions are by simple majority and consensus; the Board of Directors runs on consensus. It is not an exaggeration to say that OSCA is the most complex, intense, and authentic &quot;real life&quot; experience available to Oberlin College students.
  
OSCA buys food from local farms as much as possible; meals are vegan and vegetarian with some meat; accommodations are made for dietary restrictions. The co-op leases its facilities from Oberlin College.

OSCA educates its members through various programs that include purchasing foods from local farmers, the Nicaragua Sister Partnership (women's farming cooperative), conference subsidies, and scholarships.

Come, my friends, let us taste peace in holy foods forever; smell peace in wild baby herbs planted where unloved weeds grow; hear and feel its ode to joy from the mouth of earth-like Angels as we dare to dance with water hoses. --Leslie Goldman, Your Enchanted Gardener

Eight of us live together on a one-third-acre parcel surrounded by canyons within  walking distance of the San Diego State College. The land exists to foster a healing relationship with nature, and help us each turn our beat around with nature through growing a bit of our own food, supporting local organic farmers, and living together.  The land  is an an oasis of green with many aromatic herbs and places to garden.The land calls for people who would like to live in an old home in the city and live as well in a natural environment suited to garden lovers. The garden is overgrown and needs a lot of helpers.

The library houses books and materials created by Leslie Goldman, founder, and works by his mentors, Bernard Jensen, natural healing arts elder, and Edmond Bordeaux Szekely, modern Essene renaissance pioneer. 

The house is In private ownership,   The house offers rental to those who would like to live as extended family and join in house meetings and shared house duties. Each person does 12 hours or more of work per month, or pays higher rent.  Additional Every Day Upkeep is also asked.

We are a cohousing community of 19 families occupying 18 detached residences (17 single-family units and 1 duplex). We are located a quarter mile from the Vashon town center. Vashon is an island in Puget Sound, and is about 40 minutes (by a combined bus or car and ferry trip) from downtown Seattle.

We enjoy organic gardening, spontaneous potlucks and gatherings, commemorating our twenty-five year history, and tending our beautiful 13 acres.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22212&quot;&gt;Sharingwood Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; rural cohousing, large greenbe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sharingwood-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sharingwood-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
We live on 39 forested acres in south Snohomish County, about 25 miles northeast from Seattle. Sharingwood is a lot-development cohousing model, where members buy lots and build their own homes to meet individual budgets and tastes. There is a mixture of owners and rental spaces and while most homes are pretty middle-class standard we have a small number of alternative dwellings including a cob/straw bale home. We share meals on a regular and ongoing basis and have a bulk food purchasing program that is available to residents.

We use a variety of decision-making approaches, although consensus is the goal on most issues. We empower small groups to make specific decisions that do not really require the input of the entire membership. 

In addition to a monthly meeting, we have found that sharing circles can play an important role in nurturing a deeper sense of trust within the community. Here members find an opportunity to come together and share honestly and openly in a safe space.

Initiated by individuals, people do things together like homeschooling, yoga, meditation, sharing resources, organic gardening, work parties, hot tub, campfires, playfield, concerts, and children's activities. There are a large number of children in the community so they initiate many of their own games and play events.

The enchanting nature of the native forests and the many trails that surround the community define a village-like setting. Wilderness to some, sanctuary to others, for most it offers a comforting contrast to our workaday world.

RoseWind is a cohousing community within a liberal small town of 9000 on the NE corner of the Olympic Peninsula. Seattle is about 3 hours away. Our views are pastoral, yet we are minutes from everything in town, including a good food co-op, farmers' market, seasonal festivals, many music and arts activities, boating, and generally the sort of culture you'd find in a college town. The climate is moderate. 
Our 24 households include all ages and many lifestyles. There's abundant music, food, social interaction, and of course the shared work of caring for our common areas. Our attractive community hall is used often, for meetings, shared meals 2-3 times a week, parties, workshops, rehearsals, slide shows, concerts, and meetings. We know our neighbors and help each other out in many ways.
Neither &quot;mainstream&quot; nor far-out, we do our best to learn to live more sustainably by sharing, raising organic fruits and vegetables, and individually making informed environmental choices. Organizationally, we have learned a lot in 25+ years of consensus-based decision making. The extra time it takes to decide things is outweighed by the satisfaction of finding win-win solutions. 
Fully built, the way to join at this point is via resales, which are posted on our website www.rosewind.org. It is advisable to get to know us ahead of time, though, to be able to make an informed choice if a resale comes up. Check us out!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22214&quot;&gt;The Phoenix Cooperative House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Egalitarian Social Living&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-phoenix-cooperative-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-phoenix-cooperative-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Phoenix Co-op currently houses 26 members -- both students and professionals with a range of different ages -- bringing a diverse and family-like environment to our co-op. We are located close to the Memorial Union and State Street in a spacious 1920s French chateau-style building. The house features original woodwork, a fancy spiral staircase, and a frequently-used fireplace.
 
Phoenix uses a modified consensus decision-making process - everyone's voice is heard, and decisions are made democratically. We look for committed members who have a serious interest in living cooperatively as well as a desire to contribute your experience and energy to the house, even if you are just staying for the summer.
 
We proudly stand behind MCC’s mission of creating a healthy and safe space for every member, regardless of their background or identity. Our goal as a cooperative house is to create a sustainable and empowering community for all who want to partake in it, as well as offering low-income housing to Madison as a whole.
 
*Unfortunately, Phoenix is not wheelchair accessible.

      <name>Friends' Cooperative House</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22215&quot;&gt;Friends' Cooperative House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Cooperative Living, Community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/friends-cooperative-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/friends-cooperative-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
437 W. Johnson Street has been home to Friends' Cooperative since 1967, although our history begins a year earlier when a local chapter of the Society of Friends (Quakers) sponsored the creation of a housing co-op on the corner of Brooks and University. Our name, Friends', our moment of silence before house dinners, and our commitment to consensus attest to our Quaker roots, even though none of the current members are active Quakers. 
Our co-op is based on a principle of acceptance of people's differences. All it takes to become a member is a willingness to take part in the cooperative effort that keeps the house running. In addition, we have policies in place that emphasize an environmentally-friendly lifestyle.

Our 13 residents include undergraduates, graduate students, and working people. The age range is often quite large.  

We want to place special emphasis on creating a strong and tight-knit community. We aim to do this with a house retreat at the beginning of the school year and some organized house outings in addition to the informal social activities.

Benefits of living at Friends:

•	Cooperative living.

•	Great location. The heart of campus and the Capitol are each just a five-minute walk away.

•	Eat what you want. Living in Friends' makes it easy to eat what you want to eat, whether you are a vegetarian, vegan, or meat eater. Friends also emphasizes organic and locally grown foods.

•	Family-like atmosphere. Our house is small enough to allow members to form close relationships with everyone they live with. Our dining room, cozy living room, and five porches are very popular spots for spontaneous hanging out.

•	Free washer and dryer.

•	Local calls are included in your room charge. Friends has a phone line that everyone shares. You are also free to buy your own phone line for your room.

•	Free wireless DSL.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22216&quot;&gt;Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage is a growing, rural, ecologically sustainable town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/dancing-rabbit-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/dancing-rabbit-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage invites you to live, play, and work with us to help build a better world!

We founded Dancing Rabbit (DR) Ecovillage to discover how to live rich, vibrant lives while leaving an ecological footprint the planet can sustain. If you yearn to live a more fulfilling and sustainable life, we might be what you’re looking for.

By making sustainability the primary focus of our long-term vision and daily lives we’re creating a healthy alternative to modern mainstream US culture.

In 1997 the DR Land Trust purchased 280 acres in the rolling hills of northeastern Missouri. Since then we’ve been building a village from the ground up, creating homes, gardens, kitchens, and community infrastructure, not to mention the less-tangible necessities for a sustainable culture. We use consensus in our Village Council governance, value clear communication and peaceable co-existence with our neighbors, and continue to create our own songs, stories and traditions.

Members are responsible for meeting their own economic needs and do so in a wide variety of ways, primarily on-site (including telecommuting). Our popular and healthy local currency is used by all Rabbits and our neighboring communities as well. Our vision is to grow to the size of small town (500 - 1000 people), with businesses, residences, and agricultural areas radiating out from the central village green.

We build natural and green homes, use sun and wind for power, and run our cooperatively-owned vehicles on renewable electricity or biodiesel. Diets are individually chosen, but many prioritize local, organic, and in-season foods.

We strive to be good stewards of our land, reserving many acres for wildlife habitat. We are reintroducing native prairie plants to help revitalize our region’s biodiversity and have planted over 10,000 trees to restore our land, stabilize the riparian zone, and provide sustainable wood for our community.

We are made up of individuals, families, and subcommunities, cooperating with each other to varying degrees and sharing as much of our lives as we choose. We encourage the development of cohousing and cooperatives. 

To allow for economic diversity and simple living, we keep lease rates low, have no buy-in fee, and membership dues are income-based.

Outreach and education are integral to our mission, and the primary focus of the ecovillage's own education and research nonprofit arm, the Center for Sustainable and Cooperative Culture. We're also home to the Fellowship for Intentional Community (publishers of this Directory and Communities magazine).

Interested in Dancing Rabbit? Contact us to arrange a visit, get on our e-mailing list, or apply for a work exchange stint or workshop. We actively seek new members to live, play and work with us, modeling change for the better.</description>

Located in Seattle, we enjoy many benefits of city living, including a wide range of friends and interests outside our home: Quaker meeting, music, environmental and social justice organizations, and the Northwest Intentional Community Association, among others. We share chores, food, mostly vegetarian meals, and meet regularly, making decisions by consensus. Our workdays honor the continued well-being of our home, and our celebrations recognize the Light within each of us. Occasionally one of us spontaneously bursts into song. We began in Philadelphia in 1979 via the Life Center as two couples (gay and straight) combining incomes and co-parenting three children. In 1985 we moved to Seattle and eventually bought a large, airy house. Although members have come and gone over the years, we are still committed to maintaining a pleasant, cooperative, multicultural and nurturing environment for personal growth and social activism. Our &quot;Solar Plan&quot; is now complete with our second solar energy installation. Two sets of solar panels produce large portions of our hot water and electricy. It's quite a thrill to see the electric meter running in reverse. Invited guests are welcome. Advance notice required.</description>

Madison Community Cooperative (MCC), founded in 1968, is a thriving housing cooperative consisting of about 200 members who collectively own and manage 11 cooperative houses. Our houses are located on Madison’s isthmus and range in size from 6 to 30 members.  

Each of our houses features individual bedrooms, shared bathrooms, and a large communal kitchen. Members at all of our houses are part of house level dining co-ops. Most of these dining co-ops are also open to members of the Madison community who are not members of MCC.

Our members are young and old, workers and students, parents and non-parents, and represent a diversity of ethnicities, national backgrounds, genders, and sexual orientations. The central mission of MCC is to improve the Madison community by providing low-cost, nonprofit cooperative housing for very low- to moderate-income people, and to be inclusive of underrepresented and marginalized groups.

MCC is run by our members at our bi-weekly Board of Directors meetings; bi-weekly Maintenance, Finance, and Membership Committee meetings; tri-annual General Membership meetings; and weekly house meetings. Each of our houses has its own unique culture and history and is entrusted with a high level of autonomy. Each of our houses is responsible for its house policies, membership process, work/job system, annual budget development, minor maintenance program, dining co-op, house meeting system, and designation of Board and committee representatives.

Our varied residential settings offer supportive, relationship-rich environments that emphasize interdependence and shared responsibility, while our educational and vocational programs develop individuals’ practical and professional skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/camphill-soltane/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/camphill-soltane/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Camphill Soltane was founded in Chester County in 1988. Two other Camphill communities in Chester County – Camphill Special School and Camphill Village Kimberton Hills – were already in existence at that time, providing K-12 education, and land and craft-based work for older adults with special needs, respectively. The founders of Camphill Soltane recognized the gap in educational opportunities and choice of work for young adults with special needs. They envisioned a Camphill community that would provide a college-like experience for these young people to facilitate their transition into adulthood.

All Camphill communities are based on a spiritual understanding of the human being.  Anthroposophy (literally “wisdom of the human being”) was conceived by Dr. Rudolf Steiner of Austria in the early 20th century. Insights from Anthroposophy have given rise to Camphill communities, Waldorf education, bio-dynamic agriculture, and new forms of medicine, therapies, and the arts. All share a common dream of social, cultural, and economic renewal.

Our programs are supported by an organizational infrastructure that includes full-time volunteers, called coworkers, as well as employed staff who lead classes, support work work areas, live in or provide support in houses, perform administrative duties, maintain the physical plant, and more. A separate supporting organization, the Camphill Soltane Foundation, provides fundraising and outreach support for Camphill Soltane.</description>

      <name>Los Angeles Eco-Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22221&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Eco-Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate higher quality living patterns at lower environmental impacts by maximizing the beneficial connections both within and between the social, the economic and the ecological systems of the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/los-angeles-eco-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/los-angeles-eco-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
The Los Angeles Eco-Village Intentional Community (LAEV-IC) is a 40-member group within a two-block neighborhood of about 500 people in central Los Angeles. Started as a project of the nonprofit Cooperative Resources &amp;amp; Services Project (CRSP) after the 1992 civil uprisings, our vision is to reinvent how we live in the city.  We do this by demonstrating higher quality living patterns at lower environmental impacts while striving to connect the social, economic and ecological systems of our neighborhood.

Those interested in becoming members are required to demonstrate their commitment to more ecological and cooperative living patterns over time. We are a diverse and activist community. 

We are organized into the 45 unit Urban Soil/Tierra Urbana limited equity housing cooperative and the Beverly-Vermont Community Land Trust. We acquired our two buildings and the land from our nonprofit founding organization, CRSP, in 2012. We continue the eco-retrofitting of our buildings started by CRSP in the mid to late 1990s.  Recently CRSP acquired a quarter acre property in the north end of our neighborhood which it plans to redevelop into a state of the art car-free mixed use cohousing project.

The community is rich in resources, including an organic produce and bulk foods co-op, an art studio, tool shop, Time Bank, sewing studio, several organic gardens and community meeting spaces, both indoor and out, bicycle shop, plus several home-based business activities.  We host a variety of events which also serve the broader neighborhood and the general public.

The LAEV-IC meets weekly and establishes priorities and policies for the buildings, the intentional community, and the neighborhood.  Regular community veggie dinners and work parties open to other neighbors, friends, and relatives help glue the community together. 

The very dense neighborhood is three miles from downtown Los Angeles, with many public and private schools, colleges, and universities nearby. We are also rich in public transit and bicycle culture, with many green-business development opportunities for those with entrepreneurial spirit. 

Several members live and work in the neighborhood. Many are actively involved in social, ecological, and planning issues in the city. The Community and neighborhood are child-friendly. 

The downside of the neighborhood is that there is still way too much traffic and pollution. 

We provide regular tours, urban-sustainable-community workshops, public talks on a variety of related topics, and affordable accommodations for short stays.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22222&quot;&gt;Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Eco Ed Activist Art Media Arch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/moonshadow/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/moonshadow/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Moonshadow is deeply integrated with the land, a forested Appalachian valley with caves, creeks, and bluffs. Our deliberate existence has a minimum impact on the forest ecosystem. We combine traditional knowledge with appropriate scientific methods to interact intelligently with nature. Our handcrafted buildings are made of natural materials. Our energy is from the sun and the forest. Trees and shrubs are integrated with food crops and herbs for self-sufficiency. We experiment with native and exotic plants for nutrition and medicine. Artistic expression fulfills personal, functional, and political needs. As organizers in the environmental and social-justice movements, we network with other groups and individuals.

We are striving to facilitate an evolutionary process that will radically change the system--the dominant paradigm--to ensure a sustainable future and equality for all life. We have created a solar-powered office space where the Sequatchie Valley Institute, a nonprofit education organization, is based. Our major goal is to share our collectively gained wisdom through workshops, tours, publication, video, audio, computer networking, and gatherings. The mission of the Sequatchie Valley Institute is to offer society an opportunity to experience and learn about living in harmony with nature by providing: 
-	education, art, and research opportunities, land conservation and restoration; 
-	a dynamic model residence and learning center; and 
-	a vision for attaining a sustainable future.

Our five main programs are: Landscape and Architecture (permaculture, edible landscaping, natural building, and alternative energy), Outreach, Education and Research (off-site presentations and counseling, tours, teacher enrichment and academic research), Moonshadow Programs (workshops, conferences and events), MEDIA RIGHTS (a media production company encompassing the goals of SVI, producing newsletters, video, audio, public art projects, and the SVI website) and Land Conservation.

We hope that sharing our experience and vision will help people move more gently on the Earth. Ecology!

      <name>Edges</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22223&quot;&gt;Edges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We work together to develop a more ecological, personally fulfilling, and just way of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/edges/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/edges/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
 For over 20 years, the Edges Community has evolved through many forms, serving as home and opportunity for diverse individuals, families and lifestyles as well as a refuge of biodiversity, holistic healing, off-grid living, and affordable housing. It has provided a place of entrepreneurship in alternative medicine, green building, organic agriculture, and renewable energy and offered educational opportunities in both permaculture and ecological awareness. Though many of Edges members, families, and businesses have come and gone, what remains is a small core of committed members with a social, financial, and governance structure backed by over two decades of learning and observation in community living. We are looking forward to the continuing story of our community and what it may offer future generations.

Edges is owned and operated as a land trust corporation, comprised collectively and equally of its members. Members own their houses, but the land property itself is held in trust, undivided and unparceled.

Though there are no property lines, members occupy and homestead their own personal area of land. The community seeks to balance privacy and autonomy with integrated community living and collective planning and decision-making. 

Our governance structure operates by “consensus minus-one”, though almost all our decisions are reached through full consensus, upholding simple core values of trust, respect, transparency, and open communication. 

Currently there are six core members, only four of which live on the land. The community is also home to other resident non-members and families, and continues to offer affordable housing options for alternatively minded individuals and couples who may or may not be interested in a long-term membership commitment.

Our membership process involves an extensive 7-month “provisional membership” period during which potential members live on the land and participate as if they were members, with several “check-ins” to discuss compatibility. 

Our community meets one weekend a month for an official meeting, work-day project, and meal. We benefit from several shared resources, including a laundry room, large chest-freezer, garage/workshop, tractor and bush-hog, riding mower, hauling trailer, 4x4 UTV, wood chipper, and small barn.

Our 94 acres is located near Athens, Ohio, in the foothills of Appalachia and unglaciated Ohio River Valley. Our land occupies one of the highest points in the county, serving as a watershed property for tributaries of the Federal and Sunday Creek. The diverse ridge top topography cradles many diverse micro-climates and habitats, from dry open meadows to mature diverse hardwood forests, swampy seeps and vernal pools to highly competitive new-growth forests. The land offers abundance in wild food and medicine, including persimmon, paw paw, elderberry, black walnut, blackberry and wild mushrooms. We have a half-acre pond. Delicious varieties of second and third generation apple trees speckle the property from an old orchard. Our meadows, rarely mowed, are pollinator havens as well as battlegrounds of highly competitive invasive species such as multi-flora rose, autumn olive, and Japanese honeysuckle. The land supports little fertile bottom land, but its dynamic forms in both topography and biodiversity offer enormous potential for a large-scale permaculture plan and integrated systems approach to food, medicine, and firewood production. 

Currently, we maintain personal gardens, harvest wild food, and keep several bee hives. 

We hope to attract creatively driven individuals to participate in and become part of an evolving community vision, one which is ecologically sensitive, which celebrates diversity and cooperation, one which respects privacy and self-reliance, but is empowered by co-dependence, collaboration, and trust.

Family friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/cantines-island-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/cantines-island-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
We are a cohousing community of 19 modest private houses and a common house built on three acres of a 9.5 acre property, with one-quarter mile frontage on the Esopus, a deep-water creek, between the falls over Barclay's Dam and the Hudson River. Our uniquely lovely property is the largest in the village, offering the convenience of town living and a nice degree of privacy. We worked long and hard to achieve our success, and in so doing came to know each other as trusted partners. We're all delighted to be living here!

We have homes for sale in the community for new members. Cohousing embodies an ideology of sharing, balanced with respect for privacy. We are egalitarian, tolerant, and open to alternative lifestyles. Only a few of us are vegetarians, but any food preferences may be accommodated at community meals (cook's choice).

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/cantinesisland/&quot;&gt;See our Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;  for more pictures and for a flavor of life in the community.

The LVCW is the Dutch association of cohousing (and other intentional) communities. 
64 cohousing and other intentional communities are member of the association, and of them, 4 are in the forming stage. In the already existing communities, there are about 1700 households, made up of about 3000-4000 grown-ups and children.

The LVCW was founded in 1977.

Panterra is a community dedicated to the transformation of consciousness. We use our relationship with ourselves, others and life in general to foster personal change and understanding. Our hope is to create an environment where each person may achieve some degree of personal transformation with support from the community.

We conduct classes and workshops designed to promote self-awareness. The &quot;studio at Panterra&quot; is our private business where we offer yoga classes, movement therapy, meditation  and other sessions centered on the transformation of consciousness as a way to serve the local community. Although we are primarily a community of two, we have had individuals stay for periods of time with set purposes. We are willing to share ideas and resources with others to encourage self-empowerment and community improvement.

In part, our intention is to reduce suffering.  We do not claim to have answers, but we do offer possibilities for change and hope. We do not declare universal truths, but we do advance the search for personal current truth and its understanding. We honor the story of individuals and avoid adherence to dogmatic forms. Artistic and creative expression is actively supported, but we reserve the right to exclude expressions of violence within the community.

Ten Stones is an intentional community designed, organized, and developed by its 17 member-families. It embraces 85 acres of woodland, meadow, and agricultural land and 16 clustered, privately owned, half-acre home sites. We have no common creed other than a desire to live cooperatively, ecologically, and economically. Our community features a constructed wetland for wastewater treatment, five straw-bale homes, an organic subscription garden (CSA), and a chicken co-op. Our common house is the focal point of many community activities, such as shared meals, yoga classes, meditations, craft making, community meetings, movie nights, public lectures, and various celebratory activities. The families of Ten Stones enjoy sharing resources, caring for each other's children, and designing rituals to mark important events in our lives. Our community also enjoys assisting others—individuals, study groups, and other intentional communities—in learning to build community for themselves.

There are currently no homes for sale in Ten Stones.

Three Springs is an environmentally oriented, consensus-based community founded in 1993. We presently have 4 adult members and 2 children. Our primary focus is to share our land and strive to create healthy relationships with each other and all living things around us. We are excited about the communities movement and what it can do in a positive way for people and the Earth. As we gain experience, we share information and resources to help others.

We are located in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas, 45 miles northeast of Fresno and 30 miles southeast of Yosemite National Park. Our 160 acres is an idyllic, peaceful, rural setting with a diversity of native plants and animals. A year-round creek with waterfalls, swimming holes, and rock formations runs through our land, and thousands of acres of national forest are adjacent to us. The land is owned by a mutual benefit nonprofit corporation. 

We believe in living lightly on the land, which we define as sustenance (growing and harvesting some of our own food), shelter (working with environmentally oriented architecture), social and spiritual (developing and nurturing healthy relationships). Please feel free to write.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22230&quot;&gt;Earthaven Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Learning sustainable culture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/earthaven-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/earthaven-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Earthaven is an aspiring ecovillage founded in 1994 on 329 acres in the mountain forests of western North Carolina, about 50 minutes from Asheville. We are spiritually diverse, and value sustainable ecological systems, permaculture design, elegant simplicity, right livelihood, and healthy social relations. We have both vegetarians and omnivores, and some of us raise livestock for food. We hope to become empowered, responsible, ecologically literate citizens who model bioregionally appropriate culture for our time and place.

We intend to become a village of at least 150. We use a modified form of the N Street Consensus Method for decision making, and have paid for and own title to our land. We are in the process of restructuring our legal arrangements, and we pay annual dues. As of 2016 we have 51 members. We have built roads and bridges, community buildings, members' homes, multi-household residences, gardens, constructed wetlands, and off-grid power and water systems.

We are developing a small village-scale economy. Some of us work in small, onsite businesses or nonprofits owned or run by members, including Useful Plants Nursery; Culture's Edge, an educational nonprofit; the School of Integrated Living (SOIL), an educational nonprofit); or by offering services such as tours, campground lodging, carpentry and home construction, home care, child care, and healing arts. 

As a learning community dedicated to sharing our resources with the public, we offer workshops in Permaculture design, natural building, consensus decision-making, Sociocracy, creating new ecovillages, herbal medicine, health and healing, and women’s mysteries. We also host large events such as the Continental Bioregional Congress (2005), the annual Southeast Regional Permaculture Gathering (2002-04), and a Village Harvest Festival (2008-2009) We welcome students and other learning groups, and support homeschool parents of children at Earthaven and nearby. We are seeking hardworking, entrepreneurial  people, including but not  limited to organic growers and farmers; people with solar system, electrical, plumbing, and mechanical skills; healers, artists, and families with children.

We are four adults, plus at least one short-term adult,  3 dogs, and uncounted roadrunners, woodpeckers, lizards, bunnies, and other wildlife living on roughly two acres of gardens, fruit trees and native open space in central Tucson.
We share a five bedroom 2 1/2 bath home. 
We are rural, yet centrally located. It's a 15 minute bike ride from down town. This is a more rustic environment, with lots of opportunity to create your own space and projects. Our home has a variety of natural building features, including strawbale construction and poured adobe floors.

We are seeking eco-friendly, responsible, fun community members to join us in expanding this peaceful, growing community. 

If you are looking for sustainability, self-sufficiency, alternative building, gardens, permaculture, and friendship, this may be the place for you.

New community members are decided upon after meeting everyone in the household. Our intention is to build relationships to ensure a good long term situation for everyone.

If you are interested in visiting and finding out more, please tell us a bit about yourself, including any previous community experience and what your interests are. 

*Responsible *Motivated *Spiritual * Non religious * Dog friendly *Child friendly * Participatory * TV Free * Permaculture * Gardening * Home improvement *Community * Sustainability * Self sufficiency * Clear and open communication * Bike culture
If any of this sounds like you, give us a call or email.

This is a non-smoking household and we discourage more pets (they can be hard on the wildlife) but we will consider a well behaved pet already attached to a great potential community member.

Some of us are meditators.

Thank you.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22232&quot;&gt;Dragon Belly Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Sustainable Living&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/dragon-belly-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/dragon-belly-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We wish to build intentional community amid the greater community in Jefferson County on 39 acres, 17 miles south of Pt. Townsend, 30 miles and a ferry northwest of Seattle on the Olympic Peninsula. The land has a variety of ecosystems: about half forest, some of which are wetlands; a quarter meadow on glacial moraine; and a quarter pasture on wetter bottomland. There are two creeks and two ponds. We expect land owned in common with some form of private ownership of home and home site. We prefer environmentally sensitive, ecologically sustainable building materials and design. Current growth limitations may require multifamily housing with shared kitchen.

Our values include sustainable organic agriculture, conscious eating of a natural-foods diet, and a recognition of how dietary choices involve/affect planetary economics and the environment. We prefer open communication with regular community meetings and other shared rituals, shared activities, and shared reality.

The form and timing have changed. The owners have been living in California, building suburban community, accumulating capital, seeking partners, and now that they have retired are ready to return....at least part-time. There are caretakers on the land. We need partners with capital to own and build. We have considered building a retreat/resort center as an alternative community if a residential community does not manifest, or an active senior community.

Fall 2008: With new pressure from the county, we need to install septic and start building houses, at least one house and one ADU so that there is a permitted place for our caretaker to live…and for us to get ready to be there. We want to design a strawbale house.

Spring 2010: We have just put up a barn to store equipment and further visioning for the future.
&lt;/div&gt;
Winter 2015: We are in the process of building a house on the land.  We are also looking at a property just down the road with a wonderful lodge building, a huge barn, and other buildings that could be added to our project for a retreat center....with the right partners.
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22233&quot;&gt;Burlington Cohousing East Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The mission of Burlington Cohousing East Village is to sustain our community strengths and to create and share better ways to live as neighbors – towards a way of living that welcomes diversity and fosters social connection, affordable living, environmental stewardship, and a smaller ecological footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/burlington-cohousing-east-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/burlington-cohousing-east-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Burlington Cohousing East Village is a lovely community in the heart of the city. We are an example of one path to a sustainable future that includes affordable living, decreased automobile dependence, and harmonious sharing of resources along with ample opportunities for privacy. We nurture people and the natural environment. 
   Our location is within walking distance from downtown Burlington, the University of Vermont, Fletcher Allen Health Care, and the City of Winooski. It is convenient to live here without a car, although it is OK to have one or share one with a neighbor. 
   We are a relatively new community; construction was complete in November 2007. 
   There are 32 private homes in a variety of building types. We have &quot;flats&quot; in a large building with indoor access to our common house, townhouses, a duplex, and two detached single-family homes. All facilities are wheelchair accessible. We are a mixed-income community. Nine of our living units have down payment grants for income-eligible folks; the remaining units are for market rate buyers. 
   It's important that you go to our own website: www.bcoho.org
   We have a community building for optional group meals (every other day)and many other activities. A large outdoor area is used for outdoor play, socializing, and gardening. The land borders on a conserved natural area with hiking trails through a mature forest.
   The residents manage community governance and tasks. Everyone is expected to participate actively. Please contact us to learn more. You should also check our &quot;real&quot; website at www.bcoho.org.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22234&quot;&gt;Common Ground Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Community, ecology,  humor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/common-ground-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/common-ground-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
We are 13 like-spirited adults in various stages of membership. Our 3 original children, now adults are flung far. One has applied for adult membership and is moving along that track. We have a defined process for application and integration of new folks into our community. It is exciting to be stewards of the next generation of community members. Our purpose includes harmony with our environment, nurturance, celebration of spiritual diversity, and social change. We created the Gaia Land Trust to hold the title to 80 acres that are then leased to the community, Common Ground. Long term residents of Common Ground are eligible to become trustees of Gaia. The trust's purpose is to own and preserve land and improvements, promote community, honor ecosystems, and prevent abuse of resources. The community pays monthly rent to the Trust. Community members each pay dues and rent equally, and in-kind service is an option, with each member being economically independent. The trust pays taxes, fire protection, maintenance, etc. With no community members, the land would devolve to a party committed to preservation of the land.
We gather monthly for what we call a Work-Play Day, a pot-luck and a business meeting (using modified consensus). Working through difficult decisions and writing our guidelines have developed deep trust and extended family. Most of us are now living on the land full time; others live nearby or are traveling. We live in owner-built structures heated with wood and solar, and passively cooled. Most homes have air conditioning. Power varies from solar to conventional to mixed, but conservation is key in all.   We are not open for drop-in visits, however, we enjoy visitors who are expected. People interested in exploring membership in our community may contact us. We may invite them to participate in our monthly WorkPlay day where we work on the land. Summer WorkPlay days often revolve around our lovely spring-fed pond. Music and theatrics are other forms of play.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22235&quot;&gt;Pioneer Valley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We do not have a mission statement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/pioneer-valley/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/pioneer-valley/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Pioneer Valley Cohousing set out to create a living environment that encourages a strong sense of community, supports our need for privacy, makes life affordable, and provides a secure and enriched setting for children and adults. We have a place where people know their neighbors in a meaningful way, a neighborhood where different traditions and values are respected, and where we can all have a sense of security and belonging. Even after so many years together, we are still a work in progress, continuing to get better and better at living our values and goals.

Our group purchased a 23-acre meadow site in north Amherst where we built 32 units and a large common house, moving in June - September 1994. We built a clustered mix of single, duplex, and triplex buildings on seven of those acres. The rest is field and woods, surrounded by town lands.

Residents own their own homes, as well as a share of the land and the common house. The common house is a place for community dinners, meetings, entertainment, and other public and private functions. It includes a large kitchen/dining room, children's playroom, guest rooms, laundry facilities, library, sauna, exercise room, and recycling center. 

We have optional (but well-attended) dinners two nights a week, gardens, play and work spaces, hiking trails, and other shared amenities chosen by residents have social and economic advantages.

The community is a short walk from a municipal lake; a recreation park with tennis, swimming, and playing fields; a small shopping center; a library; the university; and public transportation.

Winslow Cohousing is located on Bainbridge Island in Puget Sound, 35 minutes west of downtown Seattle by Washington State ferry. Tours are scheduled at mutually convenient times. Email Lori at info@winslowcohousing.org to set up a tour.

We are organized as a stock cooperative with 30 dwelling units and a common house on nearly 6 acres with woods and gardens, within walking/biking distance of schools, shops, library, and medical offices. Unit types range from studios to four bedrooms. All units are self-sufficient, with kitchens, dining areas, living rooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms. The group formed in 1989, started construction in 1991, and moved in early in 1992. We are a multi-generational, caring, supportive, consensus-based community, seeking to live lightly on the land, valuing participation in our community and meals together, which are available five nights a week using organic food that we grow. Our woods are in a conservation easement.

After several years of planning, ground breaking took place on November 1990 with the residents moving in during the summer of 1991. Most of the homes were constructed as affordable housing.</description>

The village features cooperative dining in the common houses, a swimming pond, neighborhood community gardens, hiking trails, play spaces, eighty-five energy efficient homes, a common house with 15 apartments, all in a multigenerational village-scale community.

The pedestrian village is surrounded by woods and open meadows. We have a 10-acre organic fruit and vegetable farm on site that provides produce for residents as well as the wider Ithaca area, and a 5-acre CSA berry farm that has delicious organic u-pick berries. We also host a 10 acre teaching farm, the Groundswell Incubator Farm, which offers support for beginning, low-income farmers.

Our goal is to build a replicable model of a cooperative, environmentally sensitive village that can also serve as a demonstration site for teaching principles of sustainability and permaculture.

Our nonprofit educational organization, Learn@EcoVillage, is affiliated with the Center for Transformative Action at  Cornell University. In addition to giving tours to over 500 visitors a year, our developing educational program provides hands-on training in community life, building sustainable communities, and green building techniques for building and planning professionals. We have helped to initiate and contribute to a sustainability movement in our locality that is bringing about profound changes in the region.

EcoVillage is located on 175 acres, two miles from downtown Ithaca, and three miles from Cornell University and Ithaca College. Ninety percent of the land is preserved as green space for organic agriculture and wildlife habitat.

There are about 25 of us- Artists, students, working professionals and retired people- who have come together to enjoy simple, comfortable living at a reasonable cost. Preference is given to Friends and those people involved in socially responsible concerns, as we support people who are dedicated to making valuable contributions toward world peace, our planet and each other.The Penington’s ample common space and shared meals provide a wonderful opportunity to get to know a wide range of people. Our dinners are simple, but delicious. Our chefs purchase many organic or locally grown ingredients and provide both vegetarian and non-vegetarian entrees.  
   Everyone shares in the housework, which consists of housekeeping details, dining room chores and bathroom cleaning.  Participation in these duties is an integral part of PFH and vital to both its physical existence and spiritual core of sharing, service, and community life.  Residents are asked to participate on various committees for decision making within the house and to make every effort to attend dinner together.   It cannot be emphasized too strongly that residency at PFH depends upon a healthy, responsible attitude of cooperation and contribution.
     We also have 2 overnight guest rooms for Friends traveling through the city.  These can be rented for up to 2 weeks.  guest room reservation information can be found on our website.</description>

White Buffalo Farm, a Farm-Based Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Restoring our food, our earth, ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/white-buffalo-farm-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/white-buffalo-farm-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
White Buffalo Farm is one of Colorado's oldest organic farms and a virtual paradise of fruit trees nestled in the foothills of the West Elk Wilderness, yet is an easy bike ride to Paonia. The farm is traversed by the North Fork of the Gunnison River and two irrigation ditches.  The farm is USDA certified organic and its founders pioneers in the organics movement.

Established in 1974, the farm's founder has years of experience growing food and community. White Buffalo Farm is evolving with the times. We are ready to engage wonderful new trends in organics, slow food, sustainability, slow money and relocalization.

If you are would like to explore living on the farm, please consider coming to the farm as an intern, apprentice or in a “staff” position.  For 2014, we seek a kitchen manager, an artisan cook, a vegetable farmer and a CSA coordinator.  We also need a part time administrative assistant/bookkeeper.

The farm is home to thousands of fruit trees, several acres of vegetables and three high tunnel greenhouses.  We grow cherries, European and Asian plum, peaches, d'Anjou and Asian pears, and apples. We grow tomatoes, squash, greens and a wide variety of other herbs and vegetables for our CSA.  We also raise laying hens, guinea hens, turkeys and peacocks.  WBF sells wholesale to the Front Range, direct at Farmers Markets and thru our Community Supported Agriculture (CSA).

Our core values are strengthening organic family farms, growing food for others, eating holistically and locally, placing goodness before money, faith in Spirit/God/Universe, being kind to the earth and ourselves, living in gratitude, being service-oriented, honoring creativity and art, honoring equity, demonstrating tolerance.

Growing food is healing, rewarding and feels great!  It's a great time to become part of White Buffalo Farm!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22245&quot;&gt;Du•ma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The mission of Duma is to demonstrate a more sustainable and fulfilling way of living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/du%e2%80%a2ma/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/du%e2%80%a2ma/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Du•má is a close-knit group of seven to nine people living together in a beautiful old home on a quiet residential neighborhood in Eugene just south of the University of Oregon.

People of all ages have lived at Duma--from newborn to seniors.  During the day people are typically at work or school and in the evening come together to enjoy vegetarian dinners.   We share our living expenses (but not our incomes), nurture our relationships with one another, and share the joys and responsibilities of taking care of our large home.

We have a large lot with an impressive garden that includes fruit trees, berry vines, vegetables, flowers, and herbs.  We also have solar panels, a sauna, hot tub, beehive, cob oven, and a chicken coop.

Du•má began as a vision of several people who lived together collectively in the late 1980s. They aspired to buy a home that could be a model of both sustainability and community. The first eight members began living together in 1990. Over the years dozens of people have lived at Du•má–-some for just a few months and others for many years.  

One-by-one every room in the house was renovated, windows replaced, and wood floors re-finished.  The gravel parking lot in back was removed and replaced with fruit tress, vegetables, and a deck.

Visitors often remark that we are neat, well organized, and accountable to one another. They notice the many little touches that make our home beautiful and notice that we usually get along well with each other.  Visitors who share dinner with us comment on our scrumptious meals.

While the founders aspired to have everyone become a co-owner, the responsibility and stamina required to hold a collective vision, nurture community, and be a homeowner was more than most people were able to commit to.  Over time, members of the core group moved on to other things and by 2009 only one member of the core group remained. 

Du•má is now a unique private/collective hybrid with private ownership and shared day-to-day decisions about food, events, etc.  With one owner there's a clear line of accountability, less work, and shorter meetings, but the trade-off is less group autonomy.  

Visitors are welcome to stay on a night-by-night basis for up to 3 nights. Please contact us at least one week in advance to make arrangements.  

From time to time we are looking for people to live with us.  We have a strong preference for people who will live here for a year or more. If this arrangement appeals to you please be in touch.</description>

water &amp; homeschooling. The goal is a viable community retreat where everyone works and is not reliant on Big Brother hand-outs.
Preference to military retired and self-employed couples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bear-creek-farms/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bear-creek-farms/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Find out if you qualify to be in this land trust. Be one of six families to experience Shangri-La in the Cascade Mountains. Enjoy a healthy and mild four seasons at 3400 ft elevation, a trout stream with waterfalls, a pristine aquifer, a farm sanctuary off the electric grid, and access to one million acres of slow-growth, privately owned forest preserve. We also have arts and crafts studios, an herb and health food store, martial arts and complete gym, private woodworking and blacksmithing shops, family wholesome video rentals, an indoor archery range, amazing 5.7 average daily solar count, and enough outdoor adventure to keep one entertained forever. 
The dream is 90 percent complete. We are in the final production of 14 full-length books dealing with all aspects of community, alternative health and survival in preparation for the collapse of Western Civilization. We don't indulge racism, homophobia, egalitarians, programmed TV or computer junkies, and certainly not paramilitary types, but we also disdain pacifists. We embrace self-defense training, live music, home schooling, consensus, and high-tech things to bridge the gap back to a 16th century lifestyle. 
Tell us about your holistic pursuits, the tools, equipment, and finances you command. Be ready to relocate as we have zero tolerance for fence sitters and the curious. It's best to come with your own house on wheels. Send your resume with a SASE and tell us how you might help complete the dream. Farm sanctuary is sixteen miles en route to our large complex in a remote village with only two stop signs and no traffic lights. We have a Lear Jet county airport, a PGA-rated golf course and a unique county fair with top arts and crafts. 
We focus on what is good for the fifth generation, starting with a complete divorce from the evil empire. We like horses, goats, alpacas, cats, disciplined guard dogs, and mules. Tell us about your diet.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22247&quot;&gt;Windward&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Windward is a cooperative community of over thirty years in the making dedicated to preserving and developing village scale technologies needed to support a thriving sustainable community on marginal land.

We come together with the belief that now is the time for radical change, and that nothing is more convincing than a working model of a better way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/windward/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/windward/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Windward is an Intentional Community, currently with 7 core members looking to expand to 20-30 people.

Windward began with an effort in the 70s to create a new Venice in the Caribbean. When this effort was destroyed two folks moved to Nevada, cultivating a small polyamorous family that became Windward. By the 80s they'd raised the capital needed to move onto the land.

In 2005, the remaining founder began looking for new members in the younger half of life; to pass on skills, knowledge, infrastructure, and leadership to.

LOVE BASED LIVING- many members of Windward are a polyamorous line-family, a relationship  structure evolved from belief that intimacy (intellectual, emotional, physical &amp; spiritual) are core &quot;tools&quot; we have to build connections to sustain community in good times &amp;bad, and pass on the reins from generation to generation.

It's clear to us that LOVE is the most powerful and abundant creative tool we have &amp; the more of a spirit of love, communication and honesty permeates Windward the more &quot;sustainable&quot; we are.

We use our relationship energy with the same intention that we use the rest of our life energy - to build community and a good life that is in balance with the land we love and live with.

We're happy to talk about it to those who are genuine seeking understanding.

ECOVILLAGE BUILDING- Working with the land is a big part of Windward. Our 130 acres of high, dry, cold-temperate forest is considered of &quot;marginal&quot; by most.

This fragile &amp; unique landscape poses interesting challenges as we learn to live within it's woodlands and prairies. We're working on integrated, broad-acre village scale permaculture systems to meet our needs for food, water, clothing, shelter, energy, other materials.

We've a ways to go, but we're well underway in implementing many facets of these complex and fascinating systems. There is quite a lot more to be done &amp; many niches to get involved in cultivating this village ecosystem.

GROWTH &amp; TRANSITION- We're in process of constructing housing for our members. We utilize Rv's and Mobile Homes as intermediary housing as we develop our capacity as  natural builders.

We're straddling the divide between transition and stability, &amp; are looking for more brave hearts &amp; wild souls to join us in the adventure. 

If you want to try out living in an established but growing sex+ community, we want to hear from you!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22248&quot;&gt;Songaia Cohousing Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Songaia Neighborhood strives to collaboratively create a vibrant, rewarding, and sustainable community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/songaia-cohousing-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/songaia-cohousing-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Songaia Neighborhood is located about 20 miles north of Seattle, where our 17 homes are surrounded by a small forest, organic gardens, orchards, and a meadow.  Our multi-generational community was established in 1993 and is still expanding; we currently have about 40 residents and are recruiting for the purchase and development of additional land.  Songaia is well-known for our activism within the communities movement, and we welcome others who aspire to have a connected and sustainable lifestyle.

Our community life is active; we gather for five shared meals per week and celebrate, work, and pursue learning together. As a result of these many connections, we have grown to be a strong web of friends and neighbors.  We have an ethical commitment to hearing all voices in our community and therefore use a consensus decision-making process and rotational leadership. In community processes, we aim to create a space that is a supportive environment for people of all ages, backgrounds, and interests.  

The Songaia Neighborhood is actually composed of multiple intentional communities.  Our original property is the Songaia Cohousing Association, but over the last few years we have expanded to include two additional communities; Life Song Commons and New Earth Song.  That being said, for most practical purposes we function as a single unit.  The Songaia Cohousing Association has 13 member-owned 1-to-3-bedroom duplex units (including several studio apartments) which are clustered around a common green space. New Earth Song is in the process of developing their half-acre with a single-family house into seven residential units. Life Song Commons is located on 1.3 acres with a large house and small cottage, and functions as a shared household. We are planning to grow our neighborhood, so if you might be interested in joining us please visit our website for more information.

Our desire for sustainability inspires us to share resources and skills whenever possible.  Members and Associates (including non-residents) have access to our extensive facilities and land. The common house includes eating and meeting spaces, two guest rooms, laundry facilities, a playroom for our children and much more. Our barn has a greenhouse, food pantries, tool shop (woodworking, electrical, auto), ceramics room, and storage. The land includes a small forest, wetlands, several organic gardens, two orchards, a central lawn, and a meadow.

We also aim to connect with local, regional, and national communities.  Because of our work to create self-sustaining food sources on our property, we have become involved in the local permaculture and organic agriculture movements. Our community is also devoted to education; we host a vibrant internship program that attracts volunteers through WWOOF, Bastyr University, and University of Washington Bothell. Songaia has provided land and support for the Rites of Passage Journeys, which runs programs that connect people to the wilderness and assist them in life transitions. Additionally, we are active participants in the regional and national intentional communities movement. 

To learn more, please review our website where you can contact us to arrange a visit or ask questions about our plans for growth.</description>

      <name>Vine &amp; Fig Tree Farm/Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22249&quot;&gt;Vine &amp; Fig Tree Farm/Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our primary focus: nonviolently sustainable and cooperative simple living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/vine-fig-tree-farmcommunity/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/vine-fig-tree-farmcommunity/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The original Vine &amp; Fig Tree was formed in 1986 as a land-based community with a vision of people living “in loving Gandhian nonviolence among ourselves and with all creation.” This community was successful in many ways (11 adults and kids at peak, two home-birthed children, growing a lot of our own food, hosting peace/justice gatherings, etc) but dissolved in 2000 due to a combination of factors, divorce of the couple who held title to the land, members deciding to move to town to be closer to work and/or schools, etc.

Three of us are now inviting people to join us in re-establishing the community on about 60 acres of the same land, holding to the same basic vision but with new emphasis on dirt-level sustainability, shaking off our culture’s addiction to high-energy lifestyles and learning, as we are able, how to live on current solar income. We are especially interested in attracting people who want to engage in sustainable/organic farming or at least grow a large share of their own food, individually and/or cooperatively, and who want to build their own low-impact housing.

We have in mind a land trust type ecovillage planned according to permaculture principles. Our idea is for members to own their own housing, with assurance of tenure and right of inheritance and sale, but to take the land off the real estate market. Those who come in first will help determine details of the community structure and process with regard to cost-sharing, land use, decision-making, etc. We prefer consensus decision making and assume members will be enthusiastically committed to cooperative living and mutual support in work and play. We think it is important for us to be good citizens of the surrounding unintentional community and find opportunities to develop cooperative relationships with our neighbors. We also hope our community will to some extent become a model learning and service center for others (which could also be another source of income for individuals and/or the community).

The name Vine &amp; Fig Tree comes from Scripture (Micah 4, “and every one ‘neath their vine and fig tree, shall live in peace and unafraid”) and conveys a sense of our fundamental vision. This does not mean we intend to be a &quot;religious&quot; community. We are open to members of any (or no) faith tradition and believe that joyously celebrating authentic spiritual traditions and the arts are as important as sustaining physical life.</description>

      <name>Goodenough Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22250&quot;&gt;Goodenough Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; With over 40 years of history, we understand what is involved in developing generations of growing people by utilizing experiential education, cultural programs, and through valuing relationships. Our community is designed to be an organized social response to the needs and desires of our members and friends as they seek to improve their lives. Our programs utilize learning and cultural events that that foster friendship and suggest good ways of living.  We work toward the goals of self development, learning skills of relationship, and building our capacity to be of service. Our programs and events are open to the public.
With a mission to encourage human development and enrich relationships, we hope to network with other communities with a similar focus: to demonstrate the contributions community makes to a society that seeks to be just, sane and humane. We believe that the work of communities is a vital strength to society and democracy.  We believe this can be learned in intentional communities such as ours.
At our retreat center, Sahale, we bring together the principles of land permaculture and human permaculture, increasing food production, wise use of resources on the land, and the development of an Ecovillage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/goodenough-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/goodenough-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Goodenough Community started as a group of friends interested in human development. We envision ourselves collaborating in spirited living and lifelong learning as individuals, through our relationships and through organization. We choose the model of a learning community as a transformative path to open our hearts and add our energies to a world that will be more just, sane and peacefully interconnected. The community includes people living in or near Seattle, some in shared housing, and an EcoVillage and retreat center, Sahale Learning Center, on 67 acres of land near the Hood Canal in Washington State.
The Goodenough Community has been developing for over 40 years as an association of people who value the importance of community to a healthy society. Those who founded our community were convinced of the value of community in helping people mature, form healthy and lasting relationships, and learn the skills of organizing, leadership, and being of service to the broader world. Our demonstration of ways of living cooperatively is based on individual freedom coupled with learning the skills of joining with others. We have learned that living in community can both transform individual lives and bring about social change. Our community has a strong interfaith spiritual core growing from the Perennial Wisdom, however individuals are free to choose their own path.
Members of the Goodenough Community live and practice within a “village without walls”: Members believe that if ever there was a time to offer to the public the value of community, now is that time. We intend this demonstration of social creativity and service to inspire others, even as we receive inspiration from other culturally creative people. Knowing that happiness comes from learning and serving, we are doing our part for a better world by supporting the development of mature adults able to both lead and follow in good will. The community provides cultural experiences for women, men, couples, families, young adults and elders. Training and education is a strong focus, and members participate in events designed to help learn the skills of being human at the level of self, relationship and organization or service. 
We acquired land in 2001 – Sahale Learning Center. Here we are forming an EcoVillage, study the ways of permaculture for food production and land use, and run a retreat center for ourselves and for other groups. At Sahale we hold weekend workshops, social gatherings, and an annual Human Relations Laboratory in August of each year.
The Goodenough Community offers consultation services to other communities, co-housing groups, and other groups forming around a shared purpose. Consultants are trained and experienced leaders and teachers who have studied community organization and group dynamics for decades, as members and leaders in the Goodenough Community and elsewhere in their professional careers.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22251&quot;&gt;Camphill Village Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The mission of Camphill Village Minnesota is to create and sustain a community where people with and without disabilities live, work and care for each other to foster social, spiritual, cultural and agricultural renewal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/camphill-village-minnesota-inc/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/camphill-village-minnesota-inc/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Camphill is located on a 500-acre biodynamic farm ten miles north of Sauk Centre in Central Minnesota. People live together family-style in seven different homes. Everyone shares in the responsibilities of life in the community.

The Village has a strong agricultural component made up of organic farming and gardening. Craft work includes weaving, wood working, ceramics, and card-making, as well as a bakery that provides for the needs of the Village and sells in the surrounding area.

Life in the Village revolves around the cycles of nature, with festivals marking the changing seasons. Plays, concerts, lectures and continuing education add depth and color to the fabric of the community.

Camphill Village Minnesota is part of a worldwide movement that was begun in Scotland by Dr. Karl König just before World War II. The work of Camphill is based on the teachings of Rudolf Steiner, the Austrian scientist, philosopher and educator who also inspired Waldorf education.

Community members join us from all over the world every year. We welcome individuals, couples and families in whatever form they may come. Some stay for a year or two for a unique experience and some make CVM their permanent home.</description>

      <name>Atlantis Ecological Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22252&quot;&gt;Atlantis Ecological Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; organic self-sufficient ecology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/atlantis-ecological-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/atlantis-ecological-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Atlantis formed in London in 1970 as a self-help therapy centre, moved to an Irish island in 1974 then to the Colombian Andes in 1987, our emphasis shifting to ecology and food self-sufficiency. We ran a “green theatre” in Colombia for many years with the commune children as the main performers. Now grown up, some of the girls of our group are accomplished musicians, composers, artists and dancers. None of the children had any formal schooling whatsoever. They were taught to work on practical farm tasks from an early age, and allowed complete physical (and sexual) freedom, as long as the adults' space was not intruded upon. 

The commune may now be entering an &quot;autumnal&quot; phase as the many generations of English, Irish and Colombian youngsters we have brought up have gone their ways. The present age range is 3 to 67 years with a steady but small central nucleus of a handful of people; but many visitors passing through. 

We're vegetarian, and revolutionary politically. Our food is organically grown. We don't use drugs or smoke and stick to alternative medicine wherever possible; our lifestyle on the farm is 100 percent ecological. We reject practically all twentieth-century values. We have at present 35 hectares of forest, meadows, gardens, rivers and streams at around
5,000 ft with a mild climate. We accept hard physical work as part of natural living, but make sure there is time for rest, playing music and other cultural activities.
       
Visitors are welcome any time but we do need help with expenses, have to warn the work is hard and of course a sense of humour, an open mind and a willingness to engage in straight talking helps. A firm rootedness in the physical world is essential. We are not &quot;politically correct&quot; in any way and don't appreciate modern rules about what one may or may not say, and don't obey any of them. 

There are 10 books about the commune on www.theguildofwriters.com Atlantis section. We still have a &quot;diaspora&quot; in Ireland in Baltimore, Co. Cork and you can visit us there to find out more and meet some of the commune members.

Rowe Camp and Conference Center is located in the beautiful Berkshires of Massachusetts, three miles from Vermont. Since 1924 we have run a small creative summer camp for teenagers. In 1974, our conference center was founded. We offer weekends and weeklong retreats for adults and families on a wide variety of topics including spirituality, religion, social activism, psychology, creativity, and health.

Our work-study program is a chance for people who want to slow down, take stock, explore new directions, engage in creative and meaningful work, and be a part of a value-based, supportive community. Work-study participants work 33 hours a week in exchange for room, board, and the opportunity to participate in many of our programs. 
The stay lasts anywhere from six weeks to a year, and work is arranged by matching your skills and preferences with Rowe's needs, which may include housekeeping, maintaining our buildings and grounds, office work, and more. Our cooking internship is an opportunity to learn vegetarian cooking and bread baking from our wonderful cooks.

The study portion is self-directed and includes personal study, group work, attendance at conferences, individual meetings with a mentor, the experience of living in community, and the opportunity to practice new skills.

Rowe Camp and Conference Center balances a respect for the integrity and freedom of each person with the needs of the community and the organization. We are dedicated to fostering a new society that can nurture the best in each of us, reward idealism and caring, and expand hope and vision.

Common Place Land Cooperative is a 432-acre, rural land trust community located in the rolling hills of central New York State. It was founded in 1980. We are currently 22 adults and three children. We have evolving into a small-scale community aimed at greater cooperation and food and energy self-sufficiency. Fourteen homesteads have been created on the land, seven of which are off the grid, and most are using alternative energy of varying types and alternative design. Over the years, we have come to agreement on 11 core ideals, which define and guide our community, including land stewardship and trusterity, economic self-reliance, diversity, consensus decision making, community participation, and voluntary simplicity.

Members have diverse views and interests. As a community we are not affiliated with any political or religious organization. Some of our varied individual interests include organic gardening, homesteading, organic farming, perennial garden design and maintenance, permaculture, alternative energy and house design, attachment parenting, homeschooling, the arts and music, natural and herbal healing, draft horse use, yoga and activism. 

Our decision-making process consists of one to two meetings per month using consensus. We are working to create a cohesive community that inhabits the land, preserving its integrity and resources. For more information, and to set up a visit, send a SASE or an email and a description of yourself and your interests in community.

We're a group of students, artists, activists, and others who share food, fun, and friendship in our three old houses. We cook vegetarian/vegan homemade food and dine together most nights. Members participate by cooking (once every few weeks), by doing a chore (from shopping for organic produce to vacuuming), and by coming to weekly meetings. We also work on the house together, doing minor maintenance with our own people power.

Our houses are great for people new to the area--or anyone sick of the apartment blues. We are a diverse community accepting of many different lifestyles. It's a terrific situation for those seeking community, a chance to gain new skills and to share with others. We are in Chicago, near the University of Chicago, and close to the downtown loop. If you're interested, give a call or write email. We'd love to have you over for dinner!

In the summer of 1979, over 100 people took over the desolate grounds of the former UFA-Film studios, creating a comprehensive work and living project for innovative social, cultural, and ecological lifestyles. We now have about 30 resident members (ages 7 to 90 years) and about 200 employees. Our four-acre site, leased from the city, includes a café, two theaters and an open air stage with beer garden in summer, a guesthouse, a neighborhood center, and an animal farm, children's circus, a bakery, and an organic market, . We host a wide variety of dance and sport classes, a free school, Germany's number one samba band &quot;Terra Brasilis,&quot; an ongoing ecology exhibition, and an International Theatre Festival in alternate summers.

The urban village of 18,500 square meters (approximately four acres) is divided into various areas. The spirit of enterprise you can discover here encourages people's involvement and has inspired many to take chances in their lives. In 2004 the ufaFabrik was honoured by the UN-Habitat as one of 100 projects worldwide that got the status &quot;Best Practice to Improve the Living Environment.&quot;

Woodburn Hill Farm is a unique sanctuary for her busy residents. Founded in 1975, WHF’s 128 acres of fields and forest rest gently among neighboring traditional Amish farms. Yet, located in southern Maryland about 40 miles southeast of the nation’s capital, we have the opportunity to experience its social, cultural, and political diversity.

Lifestyles here reflect our values of cooperative and ecological living, diversity, and nonviolence. We meet regularly to conduct necessary business and occasionally to share our hearts and concerns for better community process and communication. Decisions are made through consensus. We often celebrate earth cycles at equinox, solstice, cross-quarter days like Samhain and Beltane, etc.

Presently our eclectic, multiracial group brings many talents home. We are artists, teachers, acupuncture and massage therapists, and chimneysweeps. And yoga instructors, antique dealers, RNs, and musicians. Some are activists, writers, and environmentalists.

We hold the land through a Chapter S corporation. Residents are encouraged, though not required, to become shareholders. All pay a monthly “rent” that usually covers our operating costs. Our six residences run the spectrum from 50-year-old Amish farmhouses to renovated chicken houses to modular geothermal-heated dwellings.

While WHF is an established cooperative, we seek to grow more sustainable. With this awareness, we strive to become better in building community and are in search of like-minded innovators. We are open to youthful energies of all ages—singles, couples, families.

Our preference is for inquiries from people who live nearby in VA, DC, and MD, especially folks who  value cooperative living, ecological and social justice, spirituality, and collaborative working. 

Please call or email us to explore more about Woodburn Hill Farm. And check us out on Facebook.

We are a land cooperative of around 21 adults and 1 pre-teen living on 358 acres in southeast Minnesota. We share the land in common, but housing, incomes, diet, schooling, etc., are each individual's choice. 85 ac of land is planted to native prairie, 5 ac in perennial fruits, with the remainder in woodland and wild areas. Land is managed organically. Homes use grid and solar energy. We have very little turnover at our land co-op and find replacements by word of mouth.

One of the first womyn's lands in Oregon, the land has been held by and for womyn since 1973.  We are a thriving community of 6-10 womyn (mostly lesbian) who value feminism and ecological practices, living in community with Mother Earth.   We are a community that values earth-based womyn's spirituality; we host occasional gatherings, workshops, retreats, and circles.  Community members use the consensus decision-making process; we are committed to healthy communication and conflict resolution. 

We welcome womyn, girl children, and boy children under age six to visit. We are periodically open to new residents.  Email for further information.</description>

Our mission is to offer affordable housing, with an emphasis on community living. A Whitehall fact sheet from the late ‘80s states that Whitehall strives to achieve a non-sexist, non-racist, non-competitive living environment, and we continue with those intentions and values today.

Whitehall was established in 1949 as an all-women's student co-op. We went co-ed and started accepting non-students in 1971. You can learn more about Whitehall's history on the Whitehall History site.</description>

The idea for The Vale began in 1946 when Jane and Griscom Morgan invited a family to share their home on 40 acres of land two miles south of Yellow Springs. In 1950 the second house was built and more followed. Now there are 11 homes and 20 members. The group incorporated as The Vale in 1960. Gris and Jane felt strongly that land should be shared, and not used as a commodity, so in 1980 they donated the land to the Community Service, Inc. Land Trust, from which it is leased by The Vale. Seventeen of its wooded acres were put into a conservation easement, so they would never be built upon. Each family lives in its own home, but many share space with additional people. Most families earn their livelihood outside the community. The land, (woods and common areas), utilities, and a half-mile gravel lane are managed together. Gardening is important to many members. Prospective members must live at The Vale for at least one year before applying for membership. At the moment The Vale has no openings for renting or for building.

Business is decided by consensus. Business meetings are usually every month, with the addition of weekly and seasonal get-togethers (potlucks and soup suppers, and an annual retreat).

While all the following info is still true, we are looking to sell Trillium to the next tribe. Look in Reach ad in the summer issue. We will soon have a link to sale details displayed here.

We are an educational retreat center and vegetarian homestead located in a remote river canyon in the eastern Siskiyou Mountains in the upper canyon of the Little Applegate River. The canyon provides a spectacular wilderness setting for Trillium: 80 acres of conifer forest, oak woodland, and chaparral along the banks of the Little Applegate River, with gorgeous meadows, several ponds, and waterfalls along seasonal Birch Creek. Less than an hour from Ashland (theater, arts, college town) and Medford (regional commercial center), Trillium basks in a sunny rain shadow. 

We seek members and partners to steward this land and live together in harmony and beauty, homesteading, building, hosting, and co-creating a life of abundance and joy. We are Susanna and Chant, a happily married couple, artists and teachers and activists.

We are currently expanding and renovating special areas for both member and guest facilities. Our land is abundant with water, wildlife, and gardens. We are a wildlife sanctuary, and we do not have dogs or other domesticated animals, though we do keep cats as long as they don't hunt the birds, lizards, or snakes. 

Residential facilities are rustic and charming, with plenty of room for remodeling/building anew. The sites are off grid, with sunny southern exposure and sweet gravity-flow water. We live here with great appreciation for the natural beauty, giving thanks to steward such an awesome place. 

For over 30 years, Trillium has functioned as a village. Current projects include finishing our cordwood masonry bath house and ferro cement root cellar, while continuing to refurbish rustic cabins for residents and guests. We seek new members and residents as well as interns for the coming growing season.
 
We are located in a beautiful, remote river canyon, surrounded mostly by pristine proposed wilderness and great neighbors. Our sweet water arrives by gravity flow from this same wilderness; our gardens are abundant and our plans ambitious for many years to come. We envision an intentional group of families and friends living together at Trillium, co-creating a sustainable lifestyle through growing food, hosting healing retreats, and creating community! 

LLC membership allows the purchase of an existing cabin or site to remodel or build anew using solar electricity and alternative methods of construction. We can accommodate four or five year-round households with other seasonal cabins we use during our programs and retreats.

Triform is a supportive environment that offers each individual the possibility for personal growth and self-development. As a Camphill community, Triform bases its work on the recognition of the spiritual integrity of each individual and aims to provide all community members with dignified, meaningful work, a healthy social atmosphere, and a vibrant cultural, artistic and spiritual life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/triform-camphill-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/triform-camphill-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Triform Camphill Community, in Hudson, New York, is a residential community for young adults with developmental disabilities. It includes a dynamic mix of over 110 people spanning many generations, cultures and ranges of ability. Forty young adults with social, mental, physical and emotional disabilities, live and work side-by-side with full time volunteer resident staff and the staff’s families on a 500+ acre biodynamic/organic farm in beautiful Columbia County, NY. Triform is a model of care where young men and women with Autism, Down syndrome, and other developmental and neurological disabilities participate in dignified, purposeful work, share in warm, supportive relationships and make meaningful contributions to the well-being of everyone in the Triform community. Triform is changing the way we understand and appreciate the capabilities of people with special needs.

Triform is a forerunner and model in the disabilities field, where the ideals of inclusion and the development of individual potential are in the forefront. Triform’s programs promote confidence, self-worth, independence and achievement on many levels. The Triform special needs community offers an enriching social, intellectual and cultural life for its students, and year-round vocational opportunities in organic and biodynamic farm and gardening. Triform is among a select group of farms in the US certified by Demeter, which is regarded as the highest level of organic farming certification in the world.</description>

We are a decentralized rural community sharing 240 acres of canyon land in eastern Washington. The two main parcels are nonprofit corporations with dweller-owned homes, some on and some off the grid. Five adjoining parcels are owned by alumni.

We are 50 people whose lifestyles and interests are varied: from seasonal laborers and weekenders to rural commuters to primitivists who rarely leave the canyon; from high-tech to no-tech; from carnies to vegans.

Our differing pursuits include growing organic food to eat and sell, self-sufficiency, potlucks, carpentry, cooking, massage, herbs, mycology, art, seed saving, nature loving, volleyball, brewing, crafts, parenting, flowers, orchards, bee keeping, natural building, reading, relaxing, rebellion, rituals, music, and compost.

Farm-grown veggies sell in Spokane and through community-supported agricultures (CSAs). A limited number of apprenticeships are available yearly. Occasional openings occur when a member sells. Buyers must be approved through consensus meetings. We have one general meeting a year and weekly potlucks.

Sunrise Ranch is one of the longest-standing Intentional Communities in the USA. Founded in 1945, and located about 10 miles west of Loveland, Colorado, Sunrise Ranch has 70-80 multi-generational residents living and working together on 360 acres in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. 

The community has weekly worship services, an elected governing board, regular community meetings, internship and visitor programs and a retreat and conference business handling groups up to 200. We also run a farm, growing organic vegetables both in our gardens and green houses, along with  raising grass-fed beef.

Sunrise Ranch honors Universal Being in all its forms—through people, through nature and through all creation. We see this attitude of honor for Universal Being as the pivotal factor for the future of humanity.

Most of all, we honor and welcome the expression of Universal Being through ourselves. We believe that this orientation in living is what opens the door for a full knowing of the wisdom and love that is within everyone. It is what lets the individual give their greatest gift to the world and know the greatest fulfillment that is possible for a human being.

All of Sunrise Ranch is dedicated as a teaching and demonstration site for this essential wisdom—both the inner knowing of Universal Being and the practical application of that knowing. This is why we practice and teach sustainable agriculture and farm-to-table food preparation. This is what is behind all the workshops, conferences, concerts and courses that we offer. This is what we teach in our internship programs and in all our courses for spiritual awakening and personal development. Sunrise Ranch exists to embody this truth and to bring it to the world.

We believe that Universal Being is doing its best to incarnate and express fully through each person, not as a separate reality but as the core reality of who they are. And when it does, that person becomes whole and creates wholeness in their world. They bring healing to the land, to other people and to the planet. Whole people—whole world.

This is what allows our individual worlds to thrive. This is why Sunrise Ranch is flourishing. And it is the experience of this simple, profound truth that will let Planet Earth become the garden home that it is destined to become.

To us, this is not just a nice idea, but a guiding principle to be embodied in everything we do. If you agree, we welcome you to join with us in bringing this experience to the world.

We recycle waste materials, build and use composting toilets, collect and filter used vegetable oil for operating our vegetable-oil burning cars and trucks, and choose to live less polluting, less consumptive lifestyles. Healing of the planet is of primary importance to us, and we are members of the Global Ecovillage Network.

Shim Gwang Sa is dedicated to preserving and maintaining all aspects of the original Zen Buddhist art of Shim Gum Do, (the Mind Sword Path) and the teachings of Shim Gum Do Founding Master Great Zen Master Chang Sik Kim.
Shim Gum Do is an original Zen Art that integrates the practice and principles of Zen Buddhist meditation with the “action meditation” of martial art practice. Shim Gum Do has six parts which comprise about 1,000 “forms.” A form is a choreographed sequence of martial art techniques of blocking and attacking movements. Each form is unique and generates a specific energy and artful expression. The six parts of Shim Gum Do are Zen Sword, Shin Boep, Ho Shin Sul, Long Stick, Two Sword and Short Stick. Zen Sword consists of forms that utilize a single-edged sword; Shin Boep or “Body Dharma” is similar to karate in that it is a weaponless art of hand and foot movements; Ho Shin Sul, or self-defense, is a system of grappling techniques for breaking grabs, joint locks, throws and pressure points; Long Stick consists of forms that use a long straight, pole-like stick; Two Sword forms use two swords; and Short Stick forms use a short, arm-length, straight stick.
Shim Gwang Sa Temple has ongoing classes in Shim Gum Do. Shim Gum Do Founding Master Great Zen Master Chang Sik Kim teaches monthly meditation sessions and Dharma Talks that are free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/american-buddhist-shim-gum-do-association/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/american-buddhist-shim-gum-do-association/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Shim Gwang Sa (Mind Light Temple) is the main teaching center of the American Buddhist Shim Gum Do Association and the World Shim Gum Do Association. Shim Gwang Sa teaches the Zen Buddhist martial art called Shim Gum Do (&quot;Mind Sword Path&quot;). Shim Gum Do Founding Master Dae Soen Sa Nim (Great Zen Master) Chang Sik Kim is the 79th patriarch of his Dharma lineage that began with Shakyamuni Buddha. Zen Master Kim began his formal Zen training under Dae Soen Sa Nim Seung Sahn, Abbot of the Hwa Gye Temple of the Chyoge order of Zen Buddhism in Seoul, Korea, at the age of thirteen. When he was twenty one, Zen Master Kim underwent a 100-day retreat on Sam Gak mountain. During this time, Shim Gum Do was revealed to Zen Master Kim through his meditation and he attained enlightenment.
Shim Gum Do is a Zen practice that brings together the mind and body through dynamic practice of action meditation through the martial art forms of Shim Gum Do combined with sitting meditation. The practice of Shim Gum Do emphasizes attaining a clear mind, clear thinking, and clear action. Shim Gwang Sa has ongoing classes in Shim Gum Do and offers a residential training program. The residential program is for those who are interested in a more intensive study of Shim Gum Do and traditional Zen temple practices.</description>

      <name>Shannon Farm Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22269&quot;&gt;Shannon Farm Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Shannon Farm is a residential intentional community where people share land, encourage member-managed agriculture and businesses, and support cooperative and harmonious living situations here and in the larger world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/shannon-farm-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/shannon-farm-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Nestled in the beautiful and fertile Rockfish Valley, 27 miles west of Charlottesville and a 20-minute drive from the point where the Blue Ridge Parkway becomes Skyline Drive, you will find our 520+ acres of forests, pastures, river-bottom hayfields, and 8 clusters of houses.  Shannon Farm is home to about 60 adults, from their 20s to 70s, and 15 children, from toddlers to teens.  We are gardeners and artists, teachers and unschoolers, computer programmers and cabinet makers, nurses and massage therapists, activists and entrepreneurs.  Diverse lifestyles coexist here.

We want new members who have energy for building long-term relationships with those who already live here, and time for the physical and organizational work necessary to keep our community viable and our internal culture vibrant.  

Members pay monthly dues, based on individual income, to finance communal expenses, from road maintenance to childcare during meetings.  Recent large projects include installation of a photovoltaic array at our community center, construction of a picnic shelter at our lake and a new tractor shop for our equipment.  We also held a festive celebration of our 40th anniversary as an intentional community a few years ago.

Shannon Farm is a private, non-speculative land and housing trust that owns the land and all of the buildings on it.  There is no joining fee, but personal assets are needed for the rent or purchase of one of our houses.  We welcome families with children and have agreements that keep housing affordable here.

Our various committees (Housing, Land Stewardship, Finance, et al.) bring discussions and proposals to our monthly business meetings, where we use a consensus-based decision making process.  People who wish to explore Shannon may start by visiting on a Monthly Meeting (MM) day.  2018 MM schedule:  Sunday 1/2, Saturday 2/3, Sunday 3/4, Saturday 4/7, Sunday 5/6, Saturday 6/2, Sunday 7/1, Saturday 8/4, Sunday 9/9, Saturday 10/6, Sunday 11/4, Saturday 12/1.  Please contact our visitor coordinator for details.

If you are interested in the global intentional communities movement and seek a rural, more sustainable lifestyle, Shannon Farm may be the right place for you.  It can take some time to get to know us, but we invite you to make the effort.  We look forward to meeting you!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22270&quot;&gt;Sandhill Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; agrarian lifestyle, simplicity, self-sufficiency and interdependency, and care for those most impacted by capitalist exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sandhill-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sandhill-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are seven adults and a seven-year-old living together on 150 acres in rural northeast Missouri. We grow our own organic food and share income, meals, vehicles, and other resources. The land includes gardens, orchards, woods, cropland, bee yards, and pasture.

Our income is derived from foods we produce (sorghum, honey, garlic, mustard, eggs, garden produce and value added condiments), timber sales, and from organic farm inspection, a harness-sewing business, and occasional work for neighbors.

We like to keep our lifestyle simple and healthy. We currently have a primarily vegetarian diet, supplemented by meat from small-scale animal husbandry and our local deer.  

We tend to work hard and get satisfaction from providing for ourselves as much as we can while maintaining close ties with neighbors, friends, and other communities. 

We enjoy regular celebrations and social occasions, including weekly dinners with Dancing Rabbit, a 15-year-old ecovillage, and Red Earth Farms, a five-year-old land trust community, both just three miles away. We also friends with the folks at Possibility Alliance and their local community of sustainable farmers in the LaPlata area, about 35 miles away.  

Sandhill is active in the communities, organics and political resistance movements. Core values include cooperation, tolerance, nonviolence, understanding and combatting systems of oppression - personally and systemically, honesty, good communication and sustainable land stewardship.  

We hold meetings weekly during the growing season and as-needed during the off season.  We make major decisions by consensus and keep in touch informally around meals and daily activities.   We strive to balance pulling together with supporting individual choices and idiosyncrasies. 

We are somewhat open to new members.  Because we are a small group, any addition has a big impact. Our process is slow, as we want to make sure of a good fit before we make any commitment.  

A visit for one week can be arranged during the growing season (we like to take a break from visitors during the winter).  Please write a detailed introduction of yourself and see our website for more information.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22271&quot;&gt;River Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To maintain wildlife sanctuaries within the boundaries of an on-going, organic farm; to serve as a meeting place for outside groups studying organic farming practices; and promote cooperative community that provides political, spiritual, economic, educational and social development to its members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/river-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/river-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
We live in the northwest corner of the United States; one of the seven communities in the Evergreen Land Trust. We live in separate households on an 85-acre cooperative, subsistence farm in rural Whatcom County, about forty minutes by bus or car from Bellingham, Washington.

Our community is focused on ecologically-based farming and forestry, homesteading skills, habitat restoration, and hosting educational events. The farm is a mixture of forests, gardens, fields, and wetlands along the South Fork Nooksack River. We raise chickens, goats, pigs, and oxen. We have some houses on the electrical grid and some off grid.  

We operate by consensus and have monthly business meetings.  We also gather regularly for work parties, weekly potlucks, and various projects. The land is held in trust, so we share the basic costs of stewardship (land taxes, insurance, tractor repairs, etc.) by each adult member paying monthly dues, which creates our annual budget.  Each adult member also contributes work hours on the farm, sharing in the responsibility of upholding the purposes of the trust.  Members are engaged in many different passions and professions off of the Farm as well, but all share in the commitment to caring for the land, and learning how to live sustainably and cooperatively.

Our members pay rents that vary by room size and are required to complete a minimum of 16 hours of work a month for the collective. This work includes cooking, shopping, maintenance, management, meetings, and committee work. By doing this work ourselves we are able to enjoy quality living space at rental rates roughly 20% less than the average in the area.

We strongly value community and host a number social gatherings and fun events throughout the year. We strive maintain a safe and inclusive space for all members.

All members are allowed to attend, speak, and vote at our bi weekly board meetings where we make consensus decisions about running the cooperative.

Its members of all ages currently live in large multifamily homes and apartment buildings in Evanston and the Rogers Park neighborhood of northern Chicago.  

Reba’s calling is “to extend the mission of Jesus by being a community of love and discipleship, and by nurturing other such communities as God gives us grace.” Practically, this has meant sharing resources and needs through a common treasury, living within walking distance of each other, developing and maintaining affordable housing, sponsoring a Monday night potluck and seminar for students and neighbors, welcoming visitors, and supporting the healthy growth of new Christian communities. Fellowship members work in shared ministries and in “outside” earning jobs, mostly in the service professions.

Growing relationships with local universities, an expanding intern program, and an influx of younger members are renewing Reba’s vision and forming leaders for the next generation of Christian community.</description>

Collectively owning our old Victorian house means freedom from landlord-imposed restrictions, but also means more responsibility for maintenance. We take turns cooking dinner and have bi-weekly house meetings. We share the evening meal, which is primarily vegan and organic. We compost all kitchen waste in our lovely little garden, share appliances and tools, and are a bike-friendly household. We also value being open and honest.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22275&quot;&gt;Pumpkin Hollow Retreat Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; healing spiritual sanctuary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/pumpkin-hollow-retreat-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/pumpkin-hollow-retreat-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Since 1937 PUMPKIN HOLLOW RETREAT CENTER has provided a peaceful and harmonious setting in which our essential spirituality can blossom and grow. We offer a rural sanctuary to promote the experience of the unity of all life and to evoke personal transformation. The Retreat Center is committed to programs and events which uniquely fulfill these ideals. Our goal is to foster fellowship, service and study; offering opportunities for self-discovery, meditation, healing and connecting with nature. 

Nestled amidst the Berkshire and Taconic Mountains, Pumpkin Hollow covers 130 acres of open fields, lush forests, colorful flowerbeds and an abundant organic vegetable garden nourished by the crystal clear Taconic Stream. The stream flows through the Hollow, past the campfire grove and swimming hole, the garden and the meditation center, then rushes over a waterfall and out through the base of a deep hemlock-lined gorge.

BRING YOUR GROUP Are you looking for a place to hold a gathering for your group? Pumpkin Hollow is the perfect setting for retreats, workshops, studies and practice. 

The central farmhouse, meditation center and cabins are surrounded by shady areas on our beautifully groomed grounds. Across the stream, a network of nature trails connects to the labyrinth, Healer's sanctuary, peace prayer pole, meditation walk and campfire grove.

THE WAY OF LIFE...is best described as 'organic' in nature, a richly physical, social and spiritual environment conducive to nurturing each individual's desire to discover and explore their inner path. Our waterfall, trails, labyrinth and other sacred spaces allow you to commune intimately with Nature and your Inner Self. Opportunities to meditate alone or with a group, are fundamental here. The Hollow becomes a 'home' as visitors sense a release from the cares of life and relax into a fresh vitality and awareness.

Service is an integral part of our center;caring for the Hollow is achieved through the spirit of volunteerism and in service to one another. In accordance with our principle of respect for all life, our cuisine is vegetarian. Alcohol and recreational drugs are not allowed on the property.

As the last of the original founders, a retired house remodeler, I am moving out of my home of 44 years into mor eappropriate housing for a senior.
I hope to see this house continue as a community, so I am trying to help the process, but it needs to happen immediately.

I sold this house. The new owner defaulted, it will be auctioned soon.
The house next door will be placed on the market sometime in the next year.

The appraised value for this house is $1,175,000 and would probably sell for more if listed on the open market. I am offering this house for $1,100,000 fixed price. Please inquire for more information about this house.
 
The house itself has been improved to accommodate collective living. Green features include extensive insulation, wood-burning stove with a catalytic converter, solar hot water tank, and photovoltaic panels on the roof. The rich dense soil has been improved with composting since 1972. Perennial crops include raspberries, apples, figs, persimmons, pomegranate and herbs, as well as year-round vegetable beds.
 
We are in an active neighborhood group of two adjacent blocks with 148 households and no through traffic. Additionally, there are other seniors in the immediate neighborhood interested in selling (over the next several years) to households committed to “shared-living.”  Potential options to buy include three single family houses and one 4-plex on the same block.</description>

 &quot;From each according to ability, to each according to need.&quot; 
Started over 25 years ago, Kommune Niederkaufungen, Germany's largest secular income-sharing commune, is an undogmatic, left-wing project; non-religious and non-spiritual. It is a member of the &quot;Kommuja&quot; network of political communes. 
The core principles are a fully socialized economy with collective ownership, consensus decision-making, collective work, reduction of patriarchal structures, and an ecological approach to work and lifestyle. We try to satisfy as many of our own basic needs as possible, and also to offer ecological products and social services to the local population. Where possible, we often consume organic, regional, and seasonal products and fair trade goods and we have small farm shop distributing them. We use renewable fuel resources for a major part of our heating (wood). We produce electricity from photovoltaic solar panels. The structural renovations to our central building are now complete, and  decorating there is nearly finished.  Our exhibition hall is home to a range of examples of electric and/or pedal-powered vehicles. 
We run 12 commune-owned collectives: 
• a building firm: interior and exterior construction, insulation 
• a carpentry and joinery shop 
• a metal-workshop 
• a kitchen/catering firm 
• a Bioland-certified organic CSA market-garden 
• an EU-certified organic dairy farm, including cheese-making 
• a fruit growing, orchard care, and juice-making team 
• an administration/consulting group
• a seminar center, with courses on commune themes and non-violent communication 
• a kindergarten 
• a daycare center for old people 
• a project group promoting alternative mobility 
A few people work externally. Some members of commune collectives are members of other local communes and there is a time exchange system between the groups.
We live in 14 living groups, including a men's group and a women's/lesbian group.  We share all our meals and have weekly general meetings. We are looking for new (German speaking) members. Newcomers go through a three- to six-month trial period. We regularly offer orientation weekends and weeks for interested people. 
Our homepage includes an English-language text about 20 years of commune life here and other info in English. There is also now a big photo gallery on the site.

We are a spiritual community, focused on yoga and service, with some 100 members living on 355 mountaintop acres, operating a conference center and a children's school. Our larger fellowship also operates a yoga and conference center in Santa Cruz.

We share in work, meals (vegetarian), spiritual practices, rituals, and play, and strive to live by positive values. Our teacher, Baba Hari Dass, embodies and teaches the classical Ashtanga (eight-limbed) yoga, with all its vital relevance to our lives today. 

Our fellowship started in 1971, and our resident community in 1978. Primary criteria for membership are good work, positive attitude, and interest in spirituality. Our conference center hosts some 14,000 people each year, our children's school has some 200 students from preschool through high school, and our town center is successful. 

In January 2007, programs began at The Mount Madonna Institute, which offers diploma, certificate, and master’s degree programs in ayurveda, yoga, community studies, and massage. Most work is done on a volunteer basis. Many members also hold outside jobs. Visit our website or write for information.

Morninglory is a community where:
1) we have the freedom and opportunity to grow and flourish though living our individual and collective dreams, and
2) where we share a commitment to cooperating with, understanding, respecting and caring for one another, the land, its inhabitants and the natural rhythm of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/morninglory/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/morninglory/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a village of separate households of single people and families scattered over 100 hilly wooded acres. We homestead in varying degrees, living off-grid using some solar electricity and heating with wood. We grow organically much of our fruits and vegetables; some eggs and meat. We've spent 46 years learning how to be good neighbors, which has been a worthwhile process.

Most of our children were home birthed and are homeschooled; ages two years to nineteen. Swimming in our pond, trampolining, tobogganing, snowshoeing, new-moon women's circles, music jams, and potlucks are some of the things we do for fun. We all share a love of nature and the arts.

A multi-generational community, we are all involved with the surrounding and supportive rural community in varying degrees. 

Guests are welcome if they arrange in advance and help out while they're here.  Please write us describing who you are and why and when you would like to visit us. Also please let us know what skills and experience you would like to contribute to the community, and what you would like to learn here. Permission is required before taking photos, videos or audio recording.

The goal of Monan's Rill is having a balanced and diverse community reflecting a variety of ages, occupations, marital statuses, and family structures (some households have children and others do not). Our ages range from young children to people in their eighties.

We work as teachers, psychotherapists, administrators, nurses, medical technologists, cabinet makers/contractors, artists, social activists, and parents. Our legal structure is a partnership, and as such, none of us holds individual title to the houses or land. Each member contributes an initial monetary investment and a monthly fee. Families or individuals live in their own homes.

Additionally, we share an organic garden and orchard, a large community center, a play area, a woodworking and maintenance shop, and a small barn and stables. Twice a month we gather for a community potluck dinner, business meeting (consensus decisions), and workday; however, informal smaller gatherings occur frequently. We try to recognize and cherish the different skills and insights of each individual and are committed to helping and encouraging one another.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22281&quot;&gt;Miccosukee Land Co-op&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Building a caring community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/miccosukee-land-co-op/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/miccosukee-land-co-op/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Miccosukee Land Cooperative (MLC) is a community of over 140 households on 344 acres east of Tallahassee, Florida. Co-op members privately own their own homesteads, which range in size from one acre to several acres each. Over 90 acres are preserved in their natural state as common land, owned collectively and enjoyed by the entire membership. Paths and boardwalks connect us to each other and to our wildlife sanctuary.

MLC members are drawn together by a common desire to live in a rural area where the land and environment are respected and interaction between neighbors is a sought-after experience. All activities (other than paying assessments for necessities such as taxes and insurance) are purely voluntary, allowing each person to choose the level of sharing and socializing he or she prefers. We are a diverse group in age, occupation, and religious practice. Many long-time members have reached retirement age, and many children who grew up here have families of their own, many still nearby or in the community. Despite busy lives, we make time to celebrate our milestones and achievements and to support one another in times of sickness or tragedy. We continually try to find more time to work, eat, talk, and sing together. We walk separate paths but we always give thanks for our land and precious community.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22282&quot;&gt;The Mariposa Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Conscious Friendship Joy Fun.  Making a contribution to life while having fun at the same time.  Deep satisfaction with our lives as lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-mariposa-group/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-mariposa-group/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Mariposa Group is about deep friendship along with physical and financial security—our land is paid for. Houses are being paid for as they are built. We are developing ways in which time, personal energy, and financial resources can brought together so as to minimize the personal risk that any individual may experience in the areas of physical and financial security.

We focus on personal and interpersonal resonance, comfort and self-esteem, and emphasize and practice methods of self-knowledge, meditation, friendship, intimacy, interpersonal communication, and interaction that promote respect, comfort, and trust between individuals, such that relationships have their basis in these qualities.

We value freedom for higher levels of personal &amp; spiritual development interacting together in a loving, down to earth expression. We explore, develop, and promote ways of joyfully enhancing fully free personal development; in short, to create a community space where there is more opportunity for people in a loving, supportive, free, and responsible environment to truly and fully enjoy life.

It's about manifesting &quot;Love, Truth, &amp; Joy&quot; in our community environment and making a contribution to the world at the same time.

      <name>Magic</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22283&quot;&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Valuescience for common good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/magic/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/magic/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Magic is a residential service-learning community. Some residents operate an educational, charitable organization by the same name.

We establish the Magic community and the service organization upon a yet-to-be widely recognized connection between science and value: Ideas about value entail prediction; science is the sole demonstrated means for making predictions better than can be made by chance.

We perceive that valuescience is key to accurately discerning and realizing value. Magic residents and friends who sustain the service organization are aiming to improve our own and others' lives by honing valuescience practice and contributing to others' doing so.

Readers wary of &quot;science&quot; may be reassured to learn that we are also deeply &quot;religious&quot; in a literal sense (re- = again and lig- = connect). We see ecological science as the basis for unifying religion, with which people from diverse backgrounds can reconnect to other humans, other life, Earth, and cosmos.

Core themes in Magic community life and public services are: (1) valuescience; (2) health/awareness; (3) cooperation; and (4) stewardship. We view the Magic community as both laboratory and demonstration. We're aiming to ever more fully &quot;walk our talk.&quot;

Magic services to the general public include lectures and seminars about valuescience; life-planning workshops; swimming, running, bicycling, and hatha yoga instruction; youth mentoring; mediation; community organizing; planting and caring for trees and other vegetation; water- and land-management planning and advocacy; neighborhood design; and publishing.

Though few in numbers, we address diverse issues at many levels and in an integrated way. We do groundbreaking research, results of which we've published in top-tier scientific journals. We also perform hands-on demonstration projects. For example, we've established thousands of native oaks and tens of thousands of perennial understory plants on public-access open space nearby, and we've reconfigured streets in several neighborhoods to reduce short-cutting and vehicle speeds. Our research and demonstration projects have received national and international recognition for excellence in fields ranging from environmental law to dispute resolution.

We aim to strike a balance between utilizing the extraordinary resources of our Stanford University/Silicon Valley surroundings and maintaining contemplative, modest lives. We welcome opportunities to meet new people and to explore how we may interact to mutual benefit.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22284&quot;&gt;Lost Valley Education Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Lost Valley is a learning center, educating youth and adults in the practical application of sustainable living skills.   We take a holistic approach to sustainability education, engaging students in ecological, social, and personal growth.

Meadowsong Ecovillage provides affordable staff housing, access to land, and facilities for community development.  We are an intentional community of educators and cultural evolutionaries, committed to creating a life together in a sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/lost-valley-educational-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/lost-valley-educational-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Lost Valley Education Center is a nonprofit organization founded in 1989 as an intentional community, permaculture education center, and events facility. Meadowsong Ecovillage – the community of resident-staff who live full time at Lost Valley – is comprised of about 50 adults and 10 children. We live and work together on 87 beautiful acres of gardens, meadows, forests, and a creek, 18 miles southeast of Eugene, in the foothills of Oregon’s Cascade Mountains.

Our dwellings are rustic cabins, a six-unit apartment, tiny homes, RV sites, private dorm rooms and camping.  We are evolving into a Community Land Trust with intentions for a staff-housing cooperative and constructing new eco-friendly staff housing. We serve organic, vegetarian meals partly grown in our gardens at lunch and dinner each weekday. We govern ourselves collectively using Sociocracy-inspired methods.  Staff members keep their personal assets and pay their own way for rent, meals and minimal fees.

Lost Valley is also an event center, hosting retreats and conferences in our dormitories, dining lodge, classrooms and other facilities. We offer education programs in sustainable living skills, including our Holistic Sustainability Semester – a 3-month immersion experience where students earn a Permaculture Design Certification (PDC) and an Ecovillage Design Education (EDE) certificate.

Our year-round Visitor Program offers flexibility and a myriad of experiential options for short to medium-term stays and is an ideal first step to exploring a well established ecovillage and getting to know our community. Most of our land is an undeveloped nature sanctuary with interpretive trails. There are a variety of activities throughout each month, such as meditation, work parties, song circles, discussion groups, movie nights and governance meetings open to observers.

We endeavor to offer the unique gift of balance in ecological responsibility and personal well-being. We hold a deep commitment to authentic, compassionate communication with the functional extended family that we are cultivating. We strive to be creative, caring, embracing of change, eclectic in our approach, and open to diversities in age, race, spirituality, and sexuality.

This co-operative of around 18 people adults is now embarking on its fifth decade. We live in and around a huge Edwardian main house, with its walled garden, stables and cottages, surrounded by 135 acres of beautiful woods, pastures and marshland which stretch to a loch in the north. Trees we planted are now being coppiced. Living spaces use wood for heating and cooking. A hydro supplies much of our electricity.

In 2016 from Easter to October we run a programme of events (music, self-help, creative, gay, etc.), called The People Centre, which brings up to 70 extra people a week. We grow as much fruit and vegetables as we can, keep cows, pigs, hens and bees, and do most of our own maintenance. All of us pay a large portion of our rent in unwaged labour for the co-op. This means ideally spending about two and a half days a week doing what we call “workshare”. 

Issues that affect everybody come to a weekly co-op meeting in which decisions are made by consensus. Co-operation is our common ideology; under that umbrella we lean this way and that, are generally better at dealing with tomorrow than next year, are supportive of each other as individuals as well as co-op members... and we try to have a good time!

There are several ways of visiting us. You can book on a People Centre event; you can come on a Maintenance Week, (there are only three per year, so book early to avoid disappointment!).

Information and booking on either is via the newsletter - see below if you would like an e-copy.

You can also come as a working visitor. For a maximum of two weeks the first time, but longer once we know you. If you’re interested, email us at visitlh@gmail.com. 

For any other enquiries, or for an e-copy of our newsletter (which comes out in early January), please email enquirylh@gmail.com 

We are not actively seeking new members, but are not closed to them either. Joining this community can be a long process.

Community life is viewed as a school of practical spirituality whose focus is individual and collective spiritual growth through service to others, simplicity of lifestyle, self-awareness, and commitment to daily spiritual practice in some form. 

Members have an opportunity to learn mindfulness and responsible stewardship as well as skills such as natural building and permaculture, gardening, cooking, carpentry, and silk-screen printing. Community-building skills are a continuing focus. The community works together as a circle in caring for the foundation and strives for consensus in decision making. Summers are an out breath, with many visitors and a public program of workshops, retreats, and hermitages. We also operate a cottage industry for producing prayer flags and other items. Winters are an in breath, where members continue to serve and strive to take more time for intensive contemplative interspiritual practice and study. 

The fire of 1996 offered an opportunity to explore a more sustainable lifestyle utilizing green building and permaculture techniques. Life is rustic, but very beautiful at an elevation of 8600 feet. Come and visit!</description>

Go to www.FarmWellnessDay5K.org!!

&lt;div&gt;
The Lake Village farm was begun in 1971, dedicated to exploring a more sustainable environmental ethic. This extended-family commune occupies a mile-and-one-half of Long Lake's northeast shoreline, having grown to approximately 350 acres of forest, meadow, and farming space. Over the past 30 years there have been approximately 300 different people from all over the world who have participated in the Lake Village program. Today there are 50 members in all who are a part of this cooperative farm effort. Most members live on additional land purchased privately, bordering the Lake Village premises. Some members live off the farm while working there during the day. Others live on the commune and hold jobs in the greater Kalamazoo area as teachers, social workers, secretaries, wait staff, plumbers, roofers, counselors, and, of course, as students in the various area schools.

We consider ourselves a large extended family and are very much a part of the greater Kalamazoo community, which we hope is likewise dedicated to promoting an ecological, sustainable lifestyle--so that our children's children may enjoy the future blessings of a healthy Mother Earth. Welcome to our home and yours.

To provide an education in the Buddha's teachings to interested students.
To provide the facilities for the study and practice of the Buddha's teachings.
To engage in activities that help preserve the Buddha's teachings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/tibetan-buddhist-learning-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/tibetan-buddhist-learning-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center (TBLC), Labsum Shedrub Ling, was founded through the great efforts of Geshe Wangyal, a Kalmyk-Mongolian lama who received his Buddhist training in Kalmykia and in Tibet. The center was founded in 1958. Over the years, Geshe-la took on Western students who had developed an interest in learning about Tibetan Buddhism. Before Geshe-la passed away on January 30, 1983, he appointed Joshua W.C. Cutler as director of the activities of the center. In the following year, His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet, always revered by Geshe-la as the spiritual head of the center, advised that the English name be changed to the Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center to clearly reflect that its main activity is teaching Tibetan Buddhism.

In summer, fall, and spring, TBLC gives weekend seminars intended as intensive instructions on specific topics for beginners and advanced students alike. Our primary aim is to develop a Buddhism that is culturally American and, at its heart, not different from the Buddhism that traveled from India through Tibet to TBLC's Tibetan monk, scholars and students in the United States.

TBLC also has a limited number of resident students who study Tibetan language and Buddhist philosophy for extended periods of time. Living in this Buddhist contemplative community gives them a unique opportunity to apply the Buddhist teachings in a practical way.

The Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center holds a Monthly prayer and meditation session every first Sunday of every month from 11 AM-12:30 PM in the main temple followed by a class in the School House from 2-3:30 PM on the first Sunday of the month. This class is LIVESTREAMING. Check website for info: www.labsum.org.

Every Saturday from 10:30 AM-noon we have a class with our Resident monk-scholar, Geshe Lobsang Sopa, who is visiting for 2 years from Ganden Shartse Monastery in India to study the English Language and give classes in Buddhist Philosophy.

We have a Prayer and Meditation Session on the first Sunday of every Month in our Main Temple. Followed by a Class from 1:30-3 pm in the School House on Buddhist Philosophy given by our Teacher, the Venerable Geshe Yeshe Thabkhe, Professor Emeritus of the Central University of Tibetan Studies in Sarnath India during July through November. We also have classes given by the Resident American Teachers and Co-Directors: Joshua &amp; Diana Cutler. The Classes on the monthly Sundays are Livestreamed, so check out the website: www.labsum.org for how to link up.

On Tuesday and Thursday Evenings there are SKYPE Classes with Joshua &amp; Diana Cutler.
For more information, email: info@labsum.org to sign up and get the reading assignments.

In March, we have the Annual Founder’s Day. 
In August, we have the Annual Maitreya Festival, as well as Weekend Learning Intensives.

All these are Listed on the Events Page.

Julian Woods (established 1975) is a diverse group of 17 adult members and several residents/potential members on ~250 acres, mostly hilly forest. The common land is in School of Living Community Land Trust, and there are 68 acres of adjacent land also in the trust. We are located 15 miles from Pennsylvania State University. Members may own or lease home lots after a capital investment in the larger land and infrastructure. Families are autonomous, are financially independent, and own their own homes. Community decisions are made by consensus of a 5 member Board. 

We own and operate a living machine in two greenhouses that constitutes our wastewater-treatment system with almost year-round growing space. We have many gardens (and many deer), a recreational pond, and an interest in finding others to continue to build our community, especially young adults. Although there are currently no open building lots, that may change, or already existing homes could become available.

We are artists, teachers, carpenters and builders, an accountant, a forester, and a mechanic/designer. Tom's Community Woodworks repairs and refinishes furniture. Barbara has created a beautiful space for meditation and yoga in O-AN Zendo.  Debbie grows flowers in and outside the greenhouses for the local farmers' markets.</description>

Nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Innisfree Village was founded in 1971 as a creative alternative for adults with intellectual disabilities (coworkers). We are a service-oriented community located on 550 acres about 20 miles from Charlottesville. Thirty-nine adults with intellectual disabilities live in 10 village houses and 2 Charlottesville houses, along with 25 full-time volunteers. The community members live together in family-style homes and work together in our workstations. The gardens, weavery, woodshop, kitchen, and bakery give meaning to our lives as therapeutic work, as well as practical, purposeful work.

Our volunteer &quot;staff,&quot; many of whom come from overseas, work and live together with coworkers, helping with their personal care, running a household, and working in the workstations. We ask for a one-year minimum commitment from volunteers, and offer room, board and a monthly stipend.

Innisfree is a registered nonprofit corporation, governed by a board of directors. There is an executive director and two assistant directors. There are many decisions of daily life that are made by consensus, but there are also certain decisions made by the board or the director. We are not an egalitarian community, and our mission is to create and support a life of respect, empowerment, and creativity for persons with special needs.

If interested in becoming a volunteer, please write for more information. Visitors are welcome if arrangements are made in advance.

Our goal is to preserve and steward the land and collaborate in developing projects and programming, open to a diversity of women, that reflect our shared values of compassion, respect, stewardship, environmental sustainability, and love of the earth.

HOWL defines Intentional Community as a group of women with a shared set of values who are involved in furthering the HOWL mission by working together collaboratively, non-violent in words and actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/huntington-open-womens-land-howl/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/huntington-open-womens-land-howl/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;

We have an old farmhouse and barn.  The house has four bedrooms, kitchen, bath, and two common spaces. There is camping space on the land as well as a small pond.  

We love the land here and are dedicated to keeping it as a wildlife sanctuary and as a sanctuary for all womyn.  We have ongoing educational and social programs and enjoy many visitors throughout the year from local Vermont communities and around the world.  Please call or email ahead to arrange a visit.  We welcome and encourage visitors to stay for up to two weeks (sliding scale fees apply).

Heiwa was founded in 1985. Our current membership capacity is nine adults. We have two child members. We are a vegetarian household, and our membership tends to be environmentally conscious, politically active, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender celebratory, and musically inclined. Our home has often served as a meeting space for political and social-justice organizations, personal-growth groups, and community strengthening gatherings.
Over a period of fourteen years, we lived in four consecutive rental houses. In 1999, we purchased our current house, establishing a permanent location for Heiwa. In September of 2005, we expanded to an adjoining house. We dream about continued growth on our block, creating a cooperative neighborhood in northwest Ann Arbor.
Heiwa's mission statement is: to provide affordable cooperative housing for a diverse membership through cooperatively owned property, communal living, and resource sharing, while upholding principles of sustainability, peace, racial and economic justice, lifelong cooperative living, and involvement in local community.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22293&quot;&gt;Heathcote Community.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; sustainable cooperative living&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/heathcote-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/heathcote-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The adults and children of Heathcote Community strive to live in a healthy, loving, and sustainable manner. We are located on 42 acres of wooded valley which is part of the School of Living community land trust. We believe that we have a responsibility to care for the land and each other, treating both with dignity and respect.

In community we support one another in living a life that we love. We don't currently have community businesses, so each member earns income individually and makes monthly contributions. We get together for evening meals most nights, weekly community meetings, regular meetings about relationship issues, monthly community work projects, and quarterly retreats. Many of us often gather for meditation, yoga, sing-alongs, celebrations, spiritual retreats, dances, world music drumming, and other events. All community decisions are made by consensus.

We strive to practice ever-more-sustainable ways of living. Our current projects focus on creating a living demonstration of permaculture principles and ecological sustainability, including the expansion of our organic gardens and the renovation of existing structures. We recently built an alternative, energy-efficient house with individual and family units, and renovating our 150-year-old grist mill to improve our shared spaces and conference center.

We welcome inquiries from people who share our passion for creating a better world, and hope to see you at one of our monthly visitor days.</description>

(Please note that Harbin Hot Springs is currently closed due to fire.  It is our intention to resume partial operations by late 2016, and full operations within three to four years.  Our residency program has suspended recruitment of new members, however we believe this will resume by 2017.) 

Harbin Hot Springs is a nonprofit retreat center owned by Heart Consciousness Church. It is operated and maintained by more than 150 members. We welcome guests from around the world who travel here to soak in our natural-spring pools, bask on our clothing-optional sun decks, receive massages or Watsu from our certified therapists, take yoga classes, hike our 1,700 acres, or otherwise simply relax. Also offered are weekly dances, music events and workshops.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22295&quot;&gt;Greening Life Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Growth in spirit; balance in life, emphasis on simplicity and cooperation with one another.  We govern by consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/greening-life-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/greening-life-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Greening Life was established in 1972 on a 135-acre farm in south central Pennsylvania. We are a planned, intentional community. Most past and present members built their own homes, roads, and water system. We follow organic-farming practices on our 50 acres of tillable land and in our two-acre garden, which produces some of our vegetables. Our small orchard is providing us with fruit and we have about two dozen chickens that belong to the members of the community.  Individual households  have a small number of farm animals such as pigs, turkeys, goats, cows and chickens.

The effort to create a balance of cooperative living, with time for individual and family has been a rewarding struggle. Growth in spirit, both individual and community, is an important part of our life together. We respect all persons and value their opinions as a voice to help guide us. We are open to share our spirit and resources with other individuals and groups. It is unusual for us to have member and home openings since the community is stable.  We do not have any homes open for purchase at this time.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22296&quot;&gt;Ganas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our purpose is to bring reason and emotion together in daily problem solving, in order to create our world, with love, the way we want it to be. Open minds make it possible to talk together and understand each other better.  We are learning how to cooperate, care for each other and share resources. We welcome those who want to join us in learning together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ganas/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ganas/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Ganas is Spanish for &quot;motivation sufficient to act.&quot; We are 75 people who are cultivating the &quot;ganas&quot; to learn how to address the problems and conflicts that come from sharing our lives together. The result is a challenging, rich environment that truly embraces diversity.

We are a group of about 75 people of all ages who are learning to solve the problems and resolve the conflicts that come from sharing our lives and living together. We started in 1978 as a group of six. A core group of 10 of us now serves as our board of directors. Members of the core group share all of their resources and income, and own and manage the community. They include many of Ganas' founders.  

Other members of the community don’t share income but participate to varying degrees in community life and decision making. Some work in the community or one of our businesses; others work outside and pay a monthly share of expenses. Everyone participates in decision making and/or other aspects of managing our lives together, though some more than others. 

Our problem-solving process emphasizes personal responsibility, willingness to hear, and intention to disclose what’s happening. Over the past 30 years we have established an innovative dialogue that is open, focused, penetrating, and respectful. Feedback, used with care and consent, is one of our tools.

We have eight houses in Staten Island (30 minutes by ferry from Manhattan), adorned by trees, and flower, and vegetable gardens. 

Our used furniture and clothing stores emphasize teamwork and participatory management and are staffed by Ganas members. Encouraging reuse and recycling is fulfilling as a way of right livelihood.  We also operate a cafe/used book shop and neighborhood stage.

The Findhorn Foundation is a spiritual community, ecovillage and an international centre for holistic learning, founded in 1962 in Morayshire, northeast Scotland. We run experiential workshops and events that offer profound and practical steps for personal and global transformation.  Our work is based on the values of:
•	connecting to your own inner wisdom
•	co-creating with the intelligence of nature
•	service to the world

Our aim is to actively create a positive and sustainable future for humanity and the planet. We recognise that achieving this aim can only be accomplished within the context of a new consciousness and changed worldview. We have no formal creed or doctrine, and honour all the world's major religions as paths to inner wisdom. 

The Findhorn Foundation and community offers many ways to visit, live, and work together. We present a range of leading edge events and workshops for residential guests every year, and welcome day visitors. More than 400 people live within or are locally connected to our community.

Findhorn Experience Weeks began in 1974 and provide a powerful, often heart-opening, introduction to our spiritual principles and their application in daily life, and have been attended by more than 30,000 people so far. 

The development of our ecovillage is a continuation of our work with nature and is a tangible demonstration of the links between the environment and the social, economic, and spiritual aspects of life. It is a constantly evolving model. 

The Findhorn Foundation is a founding member of Global Ecovillage Network and is a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) associated with the UN Department of Public Information. We work in partnership with Highlands and Islands Enterprise/Moray, Moray Council, universities, healthcare providers and others.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22298&quot;&gt;The Farm Community in Summertown, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Sustainable Living, Spirituality &amp; Social Change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Farm is an intentional community of families and friends living on 1,750 acres in south-central Tennessee. Since its inception in 1971, the purpose of The Farm community has been to provide a secure, ecologically healthy, commonly held land base for its members and succeeding generations. It is a place where we can relate to each other and the natural environment in a sustainable way, draw upon the collective strength of the community, and contribute to the positive transformation of the world.

The Farm is a spiritual community but follows no specific doctrine. Founded on the principles of nonviolence and respect for the earth, there is general agreement that all world religions share essential truths that are the moral guideposts for sanity and happiness.

Over its 40+ year history, The Farm community has established numerous nonprofit organizations as part of its mission to create positive change in the world. These include Plenty International (international relief and development), Kids To the Country (brings at-risk children to The Farm), The Ecovillage Training Center (sustainability education), Swan Conservation Trust (1425-acre nature preserve), PeaceRoots Alliance (global peace movement), and More Than Warmth (students creating peace quilts sent to children around the world), and many more. The Farm is probably best known for its midwifery program in which the sacrament of birth is considered as an inherent right of all women, newborns, and families. Both basic and advanced midwifery workshops take place throughout the year.

Approximately 200 residents and over 20 Farm businesses contribute to the maintenance and operation of the community. The community is managed by an elected board of directors along with a variety of committees staffed by volunteers. The Farm Education/Conference Center hosts conferences and is the umbrella organization for the Farm School, which offers alternative education to both resident and neighboring school-age students. GreenLife Retreats is the host of The Farm Experience Weekend and a variety of other events and activities that give visitors a more in depth way to learn about community life.

We are a 70-member collective located on 1,045 acres of rural Ozark Hills in southern Missouri. We are a member of the Federation of Egalitarian Communities, and as such, we put great value in cooperation, nonviolence, and sharing. We support ourselves through two industries: East Wind Nut Butters and Utopian Rope Sandals. Our membership is very diverse, we have no central leadership, and we practice democracy. Our work lives are busy and varied, but we always find time to relax and enjoy community meals, music jams, and Ozark sunsets. Our land is one of a kind, very rural, and filled with all sorts of wildlife. We encourage individuality and diversity in our members. We are looking for skilled, hardworking, responsible and self motivated individuals that share in our values. Prospective members are encouraged to contact membership; currently we are most in need of plumbing skills, electrical skills, and carpentry. Drop ins are not accepted, you must contact membership to visit.

Dunmire Hollow (est. 1973) is a community of about ten people sharing their lives and 163 acres in a magic hollow in Tennessee. We have fields, orchards, gardens, woods, springs, creeks, a community center, a woodshop, ponds, a food co-op, family houses, etc. Each family is economically independent; we make/have made our livings in a variety of ways--teaching, construction, woodworking, nursing, doctoring, auto repair, sewing, truck driving, small-engine repair, and crafts--and from providing for ourselves more directly through domestic economy and barter.

As individuals, we have a variety of enthusiasms that often involve us with the world and other people: organic gardening, music, crafts, environmentalism, peace work, sports, community networking, aquaculture, alternative energy, etc. Each resident adds to the diverse mix that makes up our community.

We are happy to communicate with people who are interested in rural-community living. We enjoy visitors; please write for more information or to arrange a visit.

We are an urban cooperative household established in 1979--more intentional than a boarding house, less intense than a commune; more civilized than a fraternity, less crowded than a dormitory. We have relatively few rules, though relatively much experience in this lifestyle. We share the rent, the common spaces, the housework, a piano, a big yard with gardens, and make decisions by consensus when possible. 
   In recent years we've added a 2.5 story octagonal addition that gives us another bedroom, a library and a rooftop patio that provides more space for such things as yoga, exercise, stargazing, and the occasional meeting of a philosophy book club.
    A tiny cabin in the middle of an artistically enhanced 12 acres of  highly 3-dimensional fairly secluded woodland provides a getaway 80 miles to the west. Some of our friends'creative expression, when it comes to music and/or theater,is served up on the summer side of a mountain.
    We encourage friendships, good company, interesting conversations, aesthetic ruminations, and connections to a developing circle of friends, now with a wider range of ages than was originally. We have a non-biological resemblance that eludes prosaic description.

We are 6 adult permanent members, 2 trial members and currently no children owning land and buildings in common. Primary focuses include annual and perennial communal gardening, building, and learning how to live in harmony long term with each other and with the land. We use the ideas of Permaculture in our gardens, fields, orchard, woodlots, and relationships. We grapple with the practical challenges of implementing sustainable practices.

Decisions are made by consensus. We gather weekly for a potluck and/or meeting. There are often additional common meals each week, especially during harvest season in our bustling summer kitchen.  Housing units are clustered so we cross paths often as we go about our daily lives, sharing food, work, childcare, song, and spirit on an informal basis. We feel like an extended family. Individuals follow a variety of spiritual paths and diets. Some individuals make their incomes at home while some have jobs off the land. Income is not shared. Each adult buys a share paid over a period of time, as well as paying a monthly fee for group expenses. We are surrounded by an extensive alternative community, including food co-ops, community centers and great libraries, good public and alternative schools, alternative healing community including a progressive hospital, many small non-profit organizations, farmer’s markets, CSA’s, and the headquarters of USA's largest producer-owned organic produce pool (Organic Valley).

We are in the process of visioning our future. The possibilities include attracting more young people, educating about community, increasing alternative energy use, improving infrastructure to support aging in our community and continuing to improve group processes. We are open to helping other groups get started by providing advice and copies of our legal documents and policies. 

We have been blessed with a stable membership and will have openings for summer internship and potential new members.</description>

We place much value on raising our children and ourselves in a nonviolent, healthy emotional and physical environment.  There were only 2 of us living here full-time for a number of years (the children are grown and thriving), but as of December 2015, we have been joined by 2 additional adult members, &amp; have a couple with a baby looking into the prospects of moving here sometime next year.

As an intentional-family style community, we have a collective economic system.  Each adult pays a share of food &amp; utility expenses, as well as an additional monthly amount into a maintenance &amp; repair fund.  We prepare and eat most dinners together &amp; meet regularly to discuss short &amp; long-term plans &amp; to share the joys of everyday life in our forest home.

Please email us for more details, as there will be changes as our new group grows &amp; matures.</description>

Our complete mission statement, description, and many other policy documents are available on our website through our land-trust organization at School-of-Living.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/common-ground-va/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/common-ground-va/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Common Ground, a homesteading intentional cooperative community, holds a perpetual lease on 77 acres of land owned by the School of Living--a regional community land trust. Members hold lifetime subleases. Each household has use rights to about two plus acres. The community exists and operates for the mutual benefit of its members, to help one another become established on the land while conserving, protecting, and improving the environment and its resources.

Members follow their own spiritual and dietary leanings. Currently we have six households. Many of our children have been homeschooled cooperatively in our schoolhouse facility. We would like to continue our tradition of offering an enjoyable and natural learning environment to our kids.  

Members work together in our organic gardens and on community building or maintenance projects. We build shared facilities through group planning and joint and individual labor. We continue to pursue the goal of becoming an educational center open to the larger community and public. We have recently completed a large pavilion with attached stage area and open-air canning kitchen. We have celebrated birthdays, holidays, and special occasions. Intergenerational play includes potlucks, songfests, swimming in the pond, and hiking. Neighborhood events include sweat lodges, the Fourth of July, and the local ice cream social. Neighbors and area organizations use our land for approved activities.

A yearly community budget is adopted; each household is assessed a monthly fee to cover operating expenses. Income is not shared. However, cottage industries can be practical for our location. We seek members with homesteading skills, a commitment to ecological land use, those of goodwill and initiative, good communication skills, and the ability to work cooperatively and to enthusiastically share their lives with others.

Our membership process can last from 6 - 21 months. Our decision making strives for consensus. The membership fee is $1,500 per adult member. Members finance, own, and maintain their &quot;improvements.&quot; Each household is responsible for their own income.

Visitors are welcome on weekends, upon prearrangement. Tenting, camping spaces, and a few rooms are available. Learn more about us at the School of Living website: http://www.schoolofliving.org.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22305&quot;&gt;Wind Spirit Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Organic growing, sustainable living, harmony and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/windspirit-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/windspirit-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Wind Spirit is in its 20th year. It has been a journey through every emotion along with many years of hard but satisfying physical work. Living here at Wind Spirit, as with most communities, can be challenging, but it offers experiences showing the many facets of human nature while working together and living close to nature itself.  

We have learned that the community thrives best with people who understand what it means and are able to commit to the community and to their fellow members. Being realistic about the finances it takes to run a community, openly and authentically communicating with each other, and being willing to work together for everyone’s benefit will carry Wind Spirit and its members forward, as we take care of each other, our community, and ultimately our planet.

There's some exciting momentum happening at Wind Spirit these days.  With some energy spent on organizing, there are projects under way to renovate old or build new structures using several different alternative building techniques.  Other projects (solar well, aquaponics) support our goal to increase our ability to feed ourselves.  These projects are being, in part, funded by retreats focusing on areas that are in harmony with Wind Spirit's core mission.

And, speaking of harmony, we are also building a stronger core group of residents by coming together in formal meetings to envision the future at Wind Spirit and shape the present so we can make it happen.

We are located less than two hours from Tucson or Phoenix in a beautiful valley amidst mountain ranges on land that was once part of the Christmas Star Community. On our 16 acres we are blessed with an amazing landscape, with over 60 varieties of mature organic fruit and nut trees, along with all the native species of the area. The elevation here is 2,700 ft, providing us with a year-round growing season for vegetable gardens as well. One of the few large rivers in Arizona, the Gila, is less than five miles away and is fun for kayaking and other water activities. Friends sometime say we do not live in the desert; we do, but under a canopy of trees, in a forest, an oasis.  

There are more sunny days here than in most areas in the country, so we use many solar devices. We use permaculture principles, rainwater collection, and greywater systems, and we continually explore ways to live with as little impact as we can without being extreme. The important thing is that we are constantly moving in a direction of harmony with nature.

Celo Community is a land trust with 1,200 acres occupied by some 40 households. Members do not own the land in fee simple but purchase &quot;holdings&quot; that carry most, but not all, the privileges of regular ownership. A holding may be sold only to another member or to the community. Plans for building houses, roads, or power lines must be submitted to the Property Committee for approval.
The community includes a few single people and unmarried couples but is made up predominantly of families. The member families live in separate homes and make their livings independently. They come together once a month for a meeting and function on a variety of committees. Now and then they have a &quot;community workday&quot; in which groups come together to carry out community projects or to assist a member family. Lifestyles are simple, and there is concern with ecology and social issues.
Families wishing to join Celo Community apply for trial membership, which runs for eight months if the family is housed in the community or one year if they are living nearby. At the end of the trial membership period the family and community decide whether the family should become accepted as a regular member.
At present there are about 30 families waiting to become trial members. Since only two trial members are accepted at a time a family applying now could expect to wait several years to become a member. Also, holding sites are limited, and that introduces an element of uncertainty.
I should mention, however, that it is a common practice for candidates to move nearby and take part in community activities while waiting. We sometimes refer to these folks as &quot;our sane fringe.&quot; In fact, in most Celo Community activities the community members are outnumbered by the nonmembers.

Founded in Copake, New York in 1961, Camphill Village USA is the oldest and largest Camphill community in North America and sits on 615 acres of verdant hills, pastures, and beautiful gardens in southern Columbia County. Camphill Village is part of the international Camphill Movement, which is based on the insights of anthroposophy, the philosophy, world view, and spiritual path of Rudolf Steiner Ph.D. Life at Camphill Village is based on the active affirmation of the dignity, spiritual integrity, and valued contribution of each individual.</description>

Camphill Village Kimberton Hills is one of 10 North American communities in the Camphill movement--each one unique, yet all with similar purposes. We seek to create a renewed village life and to establish healthy social forms of human interdependence. Our approach is based on the inspirations of Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy, which allows each person to evolve to their potential as a respected individual.
Started in 1972, our 432-acre agricultural and crafts community is run by 90 members, including some with developmental disabilities (autism, Down's syndrome, fragile X, and others). We have 12 houses that shelter &quot;extended families&quot; who work in the dairy, CSA garden, herb garden, orchard, bakery, fiber workshop, music workshop, pottery, and cafe. We have a strong cultural life that integrates art and music into our lives. Volunteers are welcome to share in our life and work for a year, or perhaps a lifetime. Our community sponsors an apprenticeship program in biodynamic agriculture, and training in fabric arts.

Our school also is licensed by the Pennsylvania Departments of Education and Public Welfare and we are a Pennsylvania Approved Private School for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities. We are part of the worldwide Camphill movement and the only Camphill community in North America for children.

When founded in 1963, The Camphill School was based upon the idea that the new community not only would become a village for children, but a place that nurtured childhood itself. This was powerfully affirmed in 1967 when a foundation stone was laid at Rock Crystal, the village’s first purposely built house where volunteers, interns, and children with intellectual and developmental disabilities could share their lives.</description>

      <name>Bryn Gweled Homesteads</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22310&quot;&gt;Bryn Gweled Homesteads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our intention is to curb housing speculation, reserve the environment and live and work cooperatively with our neighbors to provide a vibrant lifestyle within Bryn Gweled and in the larger community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bryn-gweled-homesteads/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bryn-gweled-homesteads/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Bryn Gweled (Welsh for “Hill of Vision”) is made up of a diverse group of people who share a way of life. We are young and old families, single parents and individuals who have chosen to live together on our wooded oasis and work cooperatively to maintain the place we call home. There are 76 two-acre leaseholds, 74 with homes, on 240 collectively owned acres in Upper Southampton, Bucks County. Our woods are a habitat for foxes, owls, deer, hawks, and many other species of animal and plant life.  We share an organic community garden, a community swimming pool, tennis courts, a soccer field, and a community center where many activities are held. All of these are enjoyed and maintained by our members. 
BG is a not-for-profit corporation owned by its members, each of whom is expected to contribute in some way toward the maintenance of the community.  Each member is encouraged to serve on at least two volunteer committees, the names of which show the many ways we work together. They include Grounds and Planting, Health and Welfare, Children's Activities, Community Activities, Property and Utilities, Roads, Community Center Maintenance, Swimming Pool, Environmental Stewardship and others.
The elected officials of the community include a Board of Directors and three committees. The President and Vice-President are elected from the Board. The Secretary is appointed by the President. Treasurer is a long term position, usually filled by a committed volunteer when it goes vacant (the present Treasurer is the fifth in 75 years). 
One of our elected committees, Membership, meets with prospective members and introduces them to the opportunities and responsibilities of living here. The committee oversees the arrangement of small gatherings in members' homes for the applicants to meet and learn more about the community and their prospective neighbors, and for both the applicant and community members to decide on goodness of fit. The applicant must finally be approved for membership by a 4/5 majority of the members. 
Our other two elected committees are Housing and Nominating. Housing oversees home ownership transfers and works with Membership on mutual concerns.  Membership and Housing are key to the functioning of the community because only leaseholders are members, and vice-versa, and while homes are individually owned, the owner of the home must also be the leaseholder of the lot on which it sits.
We consider all members our neighbors, even if they live at opposite ends of our roads.  We are fortunate in being an ideal size for such a community; large enough to have a rich social and cultural fabric, and small enough for everyone to know each other.
Although large projects such as road repaving are done by contractors, the community does not employ anyone except summer lifeguards, so all of the work of managing our multi-million dollar corporation is done by volunteers. Getting these jobs done properly is occasionally something of a burden, and hiring a manager, either full or part time, is being considered. 
The first Saturday of each month is the best time to visit and see Bryn Gweled in action.  Visitors and available members are welcome to join in a work party from 9:00 until noon. Typical work party projects include maintenance of the buildings and roads, clearing invasive plants on common land, planting trees and shrubs and managing our deer population. In the evening we gather for a covered dish supper, sometimes called a potluck, and after that a business meeting. These meetings democratically cover the operation of the community, and include a wide range of topics including fun things such as celebrations and other activities to strictly business such as budget priorities. There is often heated debate, but issues are usually resolved by compromising in good community spirit. Sometimes there is a short “closed” portion at the beginning of the meeting to discuss membership issues, but otherwise visitors are welcome.
Since Bryn Gweled began we have committed ourselves to being an open and diverse community.  The nature and extent of diversity shifts with time, but our goal remains constant. While our age diversity is strong, racial, cultural and ethnic diversity remains a challenge. We welcome people of all races and backgrounds, and have recently accepted new members of same-sex orientation as well as people of Hispanic and middle eastern origins. At one time we were more than 10% African American, but with more housing opportunities for people of color in recent decades, that number has dwindled. Our political and social views are predominantly progressive, but there is a conservative element of our membership as well.

We are an intentional community and worker-owned cooperative that operates Breitenbush Hot Springs Retreat and Conference Center, hosting 25,000 guests annually. Sixty miles east of Salem, Oregon, Breitenbush sits on 155 acres in ancient forests of the Cascades. Our community ranges from 50 - 90 adults and children. We are off the grid, using hydro and geothermal, and practice low-impact Earth stewardship.
The members of the worker-owned cooperative make major decisions about community and business affairs at annual meetings, and elect the board of directors from their midst to oversee operations. The business, financial and marketing directors all work as a team and report to the board. To be a worker-owner, a community member must be employed for one year, be an employee in good standing, and purchase a membership share of $500.
The community lives across the river from the retreat center in an ecovillage setting. We have regular community sharings, and three times a year we close for a four-day community renewal where we join together for training, fun, and community building.
We live a rich, full life here. We delight in an abundance of diverse people, innovative ideas, healing practices, friendships, and challenges.
From our credo: &quot;Our primary service is to provide a healing retreat and conference center that promotes holistic health and spiritual growth. We mutually support and respect each person's dignity, and awaken to the Spirit within each of us that acknowledges we are all One… It is our hope that the thriving Community which we create will be an inspiration to others in their exploration of lifestyle and community. We also extend ourselves to the greater society in which we live, the world community, and commit ourselves to being socially, spiritually, politically, and environmentally responsible.”

Birdsfoot Farm is a consensus-based agricultural community founded in 1972. Our farm is located where the St. Lawrence River valley meets the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains. Though the area is quite rural, the presence of four colleges nearby brings cultural diversity we appreciate.
Our 73-acre farm has fertile loam soil, woods, a stream, a large community house, three comfortable homes, a schoolhouse, two barns, and a small cabin. In order to grow we need to build new dwellings. The land and buildings are owned by the community.
Members share monthly living expenses, purchase equity in the property, and participate in community work projects. We care a lot about each other and find time for many kinds of sharing--such as communal meals, rituals, parties, etc. Each person follows his or her own spiritual path. Individuals are active in social and environmental issues. The new-member process includes a one-year trial period. We welcome new members, including children and elders.
Our vegetable business grows two acres of certified organic vegetables for the community, wholesale, CSA, and farmers market using low-input techniques, intensive spacing and cover cropping.
Little River Community School was started in 1998. The school now serves 39 students in grades K-12 with four full-time teachers. The school is founded on the belief that children are inherently motivated to learn about their world and should be allowed to proceed at their own rate. See the school on the web at http://www.littleriverschool.org.

The farm and school provide income to some of the community members and others work off the farm. Each year the veggie business and school seek interns.
For more information about our community, or internship programs, please send a letter.

- a cooperative residence for those interested in community living
- the home of Beacon Hill Friends Meeting
- a center for Quaker educational activities

Beacon Hill Friends House is located on historic Beacon Hill in Boston, Massachusetts, a few blocks from the State House. The building was originally built in 1803. Since being given to Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1957, the building has become a center for the Quaker community in Boston.

Beacon Hill Friends House fulfills its mission by:
- providing a center where Friends and others can meet, worship, and study
- advancing and fostering the principles of the Religious Society of Friends
- offering opportunities for the development of leadership and personal growth
- maintaining a diverse residential community guided by Friends' principles
- providing hospitality to visitors in our B&amp;amp;B guest rooms

21 Residents live at the house for up to four years. We create community through house dinners cooked by our kitchen manager, sharing chores and community-building responsibilities, and two house meetings a month. We welcome residency applications from people of all ages, genders, ethnicities, beliefs, sexualities, backgrounds, etc.</description>

Aquarius was an ecovillage at the 4000-ft (1300m) level in Rincons, 40 miles east (3/4hour drive) of the million size Tucson. National park is our neighbor to the north. We respect the environment, commune with nature and its flora and fauna--a sharp contrast to the urban environment and its pollution, crime and congestion. We preserve the purity of our acreage by using natural rock to blend structures into the mountain. There are no power lines to our dwellings because we achieved solar powered self-sufficiency. The serenity and safety of the place is ideal for writers and artists. Because of our remoteness we will not become overcrowded in spite of major construction just 4 air miles to the south. Room share including basic power for your radio and TV is only $300 per month.
Try our unstructured, liberal life with few rules. You may become enchanted and spend a lifetime. Private ownership of land is also available. 
We welcome snow birds from Canada and seek exchange of living space there. We like the idea of being able to escape the heat of the summer into a Canadian environ and to give someone from a northern climate the oportunity to escape to the warmth of our winter. We would consider a permanent exchange.
Our liberal life encourages individuality. The freedoms no longer achievable in cities make our paradise more and more desirable. Here one can live comfortably on social security. There is only one resident at the ranch right now. The land was divided and sold and the owners are presently in Windsor, Canada. There are 10 acres left and a lot of unfinished construction. It's an ideal place for someone or a group of people who find living in the city too difficult, and who may not want to start from a scratch. All the reasons of our past success: the weather, beauty of nature, security and freedom are there.
We invite and will entertain any suggestion.  Possibly condominium of properties? We would offer a property in Arizona, Colorado and Canada, perhaps you have acreage  in Ontario. (We could have in the mix the 10 acres with its buildings in Arizona, 5 acres hobby ranchette, a building parcel in Colorado and a house in Windsor, Ontario.) We are negotiating with European property owners also. Diversification will enhance economic security and possibly retaining ownership of own contribution. Because of crime, shared rural land will be more and more desirable.Let's pool our ingenuity and resources. 
Possibility of purchase? Of course with maximum flexibility of the agreement.

Alpha Farm is an extended-family-style community on 280 acres in the Coast Range of Oregon. Consensus, our decision-making process, is also a metaphor for the ideal world we seek to create here--and so help create in the larger world. We seek to honor and respect the spirit in all people and in nature; to nurture harmony within ourselves, among people, and with the Earth; and to integrate all of life into a balanced whole. We value service and work as love made visible. Group process is a strong point; we meet regularly for business.
Founded in 1972, we average five to fifteen adults and one to three children. New people participate in an internship of three or six months followed by a year as residents (trial members) before becoming eligible for membership.  Please contact us first about available spaces before coming down for a visit. Members and residents work primarily on the farm or at various outreach activities around the greater Deadwood Community (contract mail delivery, contract forestry projects, etc.) or occasionally in paid work off the farm. All income and resources are held in common. We are experimenting with different housing patterns, particularly for families; individuals have private rooms, while other living space is common; weekday evening meals are communal.
We are open to new residents; visitors are welcome for a three-day initial visit. Please schedule a visit well in advance as space and resources are limited. Please check out website for more information on visiting and membership.

Seeking people to form an agricultural, resource sharing, crowd-funded intentional community in  New England

What’s your 5 year plan? What’s your 20 year plan? Whats your “retirement” plan? What are you going to do when your parents or the elders in your life can no longer take care of themselves? Do you want to enjoy the honest and healthy work of farm life while not having to stress about the financial burden of owning your own farm? Do you want to be able to spend quality time with your friends and family but have doubts about doing so in the dominant socio-economic paradigm? Do you want to collaborate with other farmers, permaculture practitioners, eco-entrepreneurs, justice seekers, land healers … and share a community with them too?  If these questions excite you, then keep on reading!

We can’t keep waiting for the community of our dreams to just appear. WE need to build it ourselves. There is no template for how this will work. There is no cookie cutter community startup process. This is something new. Lets think big. We have epic farm-topian dreams of living together, taking care of our young and old, growing the best food possible, and creating sustainable, economically viable, mutually beneficial micro-businesses that have positive impacts outside the community as well as inside.

So, what’s different about this proposed community startup? Here’s three major factors that make it unique: 1) Transparency, 2) Crowdfunding, 3) Income Generation 4) Long-Term Vision

Transparency: We will go to great lengths to hash out any/all important details of the future community. We will make it as transparent as humanly possible. It begins with a core group of people who truly trust each other and are committed to cooperation and open communication (this could be from 5-15 people… we’ll know when it feels right). Through due diligence, we will create bullet-proof, transparent founding documents/by-laws based on our shared mission. These by-laws will of course be flexible and fluid, but they will also form the processes for how we will make decisions moving forward. In this phase we aim to address such topics as: location (where? zoning laws can greatly influence this consideration), acreage, choice of property (wooded forest, degraded farmland, existing infrastructure?) housing, common/shared land, shared facilities, decision making processes (consensus? majority rule? 90% majority?, councils? subgroups? mandatory or non-mandatory meetings?), conflict resolution processes, membership processes, finances (partial income sharing? a hybrid of income sharing and financial autonomy?), suggested and/or mandatory labor contribution to community (20 hrs a week? 30 hrs a week?), how do we deal with oppressive behavior?, How do we incorporate our elders into the community? (especially when they might have different values than us young, idealistic, radical folks), visitor processes, how do we allocate money for community infrastructure? (common agriculture space, grazing land, commercial kitchen, dining hall, hospice infrastructure for when elders need extra care, educational programs, etc), whats our policy on tiny/mobile homes? (this would largely have to do with zoning), population capacity (would depend on size of property we acquire), what type of labor counts towards community labor-hours (cleaning your room vs. working the field), what about when people are too old or sick to work? These questions and many more will be addressed in the initial phases with the core group to the best of our ability so that we will have a clear process for addressing future issues as they arise in real life. We may also choose to form a non-profit in this phase as well. Having non-profit status is a great advantage for a community. 

Crowdfunding. Many people are now familiar with Crowfunding platforms such as Kickstarter, Go Fund Me, Indiegogo, We The Trees (a cool new permaculture-based platform), Barnraiser, etc… What not many people know is that through these different Crowdfunding platforms, in the year 2014 alone, an estimated $65 BILLION dollars was raised for various projects around the world. Yes, you heard that right: $65 BILLION dollars. Folks, this is a significant game changer. Let’s dream big. Lets dream bigger than big. Lets envision the world we know is possible, and lets not stop till we get there. The key with successful crowdfunding campaigns is: a good idea that solves a problem, a clear and powerful mission, a solid team of enthusiastic and trust-worthy solicitors, well-produced media and videos, and ample lead-up time before the launch date so that the project can be sufficiently hyped and go viral. This is really where the transparency piece comes in huge. Also, this is our chance to show the world why this is needed; what problems it solves, how it benefits the world outside of the community itself, and how this could be a replicable model for other groups to employ. If we really work hard on all the fine details (some of them mentioned in the transparency phase, above), and create a bullet-proof, nay-sayer-proof, crowdfunding campaign, there is absolutely no doubt that this is not only possible, but it HAS TO HAPPEN!

Income Generation. If we be economically viable as a community, we aren’t going to last very long. As briefly mentioned above, filing the community as a non-profit will be important. This can help for tax reasons, accepting donations, limiting our liability, and adding to the resiliency of our transparent structure. In other words, it will help prevent power-grab dynamics. The idea that the executive director could be fired by the board of directors keeps things in check and keeps hierarchies of power at a minimum. But just because its called a non-profit doesn’t mean that we aren’t going to make money! Its just that all the profits go back into the community. It is very exciting to think of all the possible income generating opportunities we will have when we pool our resources and work together. For instance, we could really scale-up our farming operations so that they are not only profitable, but feed more mouths than just the ones in our community. Farming is hard work. But as anybody who’s worked in the fields will tell you, it can make all the difference to work alongside other like-minded individuals. This turns chore work into fun work! Nowadays we can look to many great examples from books and farmers demonstrating that farming can actually be profitable… and ecologically beneficial! We don’t have to re-invent the wheel here. Here are just some examples of income generating agricultural enterprises that we can employ: Pick your own, Farmstand, Farm Store, CSA (or a twist on the CSA model that doesn't restrict lower-income people), value added products! (since we will have a commercial kitchen, we won’t have to fear the board of health!… jams, jellies, skincare products, herbal products, tinctures, fermented foods, ready to cook semi-prepared foods, snacks, cider, beer, wine, the list goes on and on), Edible Landscaping services, Farm Camp (educational farm stays for all ages), other forms of Agritoursim like Air B&amp;B, Educational programs (permaculture design courses, farming workshops, etc.), Nursery business, online store (selling books, seeds, tools, etc), this list could go on and on as well. One other thing worth mentioning in the area of income generation is that we want people to feel encouraged to be entrepreneurial. As long as people meet their quota of community-labor-hours (whatever the community decides that is), what you do with the rest of your time is up to you. So if you want to have an outside job, thats fine. Or if you want to start your own business here at the community, all the power to you, so long as you aren’t hindering or getting in the way of the community. One great example to look to in terms of labor is the Federation of Egalitarian Communities (FEC). Each community in the FEC has their own policies regarding labor, income, etc. But in general, at each community, each member is expected to do X amount of labor hours for the community each week. And all hours of labor are valued equally (an hour cooking is the same as an hour doing carpentry, etc) Once you meet your quota, then whatever you do with the rest of your time is up to you. So if you have an outside job, thats fine. Lets say our community decides that each member will do 30 hours a week of community labor. Lets say theres a person who wants to work 20 hours a week in the community and then 30 hours a week at a cushy outside job where they make $30/hr. They could then pay the community the difference in amount of hours times the minimum wage. So in this case, they would only owe the community 10 labor hours of minimum wage (roughly $80-$90), and then they'd be able to keep the rest of what they made at their outside job. This way, people’s autonomy is not compromised and they are also free to be entrepreneurial if they so desire, as long as they meet the minimum community-labor hours. 

Long Term Vision. This seems like a no-brainer. But when we really think about it, many communities haven’t figured this part out yet. What carries a community through the long term? We would say that its the ability to be intergenerational. This means having entire families involved: kids, parents, grandparents, etc. This is extremely important. We need to have the infrastructure and the capability of taking our elders in when their time comes. Otherwise, what else will happen? Either they will go to a nursing home (the average cost of a nursing home is $80,000 a year), or you will be forced to leave the community to take care of them, thus compromising the community and your own sanity. We know there is another way. Twin Oaks Community (in Virginia, also a member of the FEC, mentioned above), has done a fantastic job at addressing this issue. As their average age is increasing, so is the need for a handicap-accessible hospice facility. So, they have built just that: an entire wing off a building that’s looks and acts like a nursing home. Its so important to not overlook this aspect. We all will get old some day. What’s your retirement plan? Do you want to be old and alone while your kids are too busy to care for you? Or do you want to live out your last days with family, friends and a sense of purpose? Long Term Vision also includes how we lay out our community. No need to re-invent the wheel here either. Its been demonstrated that through permaculture/key line/regenerative design principles, we can design our farms and communities to be productive, long lasting and aesthetically beautiful. Lets plant thousands and thousands of trees! If not for us then for the generations to come! This is what the long term vision is about.</description>

To join forces/ funds/ resources  to purchase   land / old farmhouse / out buildings to set up an intentional, self-sustaining intentional community, with people of mixed ages, backgrounds and interests.
I'm a part Spanish, educator &amp;amp; maker interested in setting up a residential centre where paying guests can come and stay, access a range of arts &amp;amp; well-being courses within a rural tourism context.
A couple of us have been exploring the Granada &amp;amp; Alpujarras region to discover a cortijo ( farmhouse with land) to purchase and use as a base from which each of us can go on to build our own dwellings on communal land. Pooling resources together means we can afford a larger site with arrable land to grow on.
Currently based in Bristol, UK but intending to sell up to release finance. 
Seeking doers as opposed to mere dreamers to set up a viable project which could involve building our own homes using sustainable materials. 
If this is a lifestyle you would like to explore, do get in contact.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22318&quot;&gt;Earth Harmony Habitats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To create a micro-community of affordable homes that are aesthetically pleasing, affordable, and uses only the electricity, water and vegetables than can be harvested from the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/earth-harmony-habitats/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/earth-harmony-habitats/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;What if you lived in a house that captured all its own energy, harvested all its own water, and grew all its own vegetables?

For starters, your electricity and water bills would be zero.  Your produce cost for vegetables would be zero.

Living in a home with zero net impacts means your pollution contribution from  heating, cooling and operating your household is net zero over the course of a year.

But probably most important, you would be one of the few folks in the Industrial world to flourish in a home that lives within its equitable share of earth’s carrying capacity.  Zero pollution, zero adverse impacts.

The project consists of 4 octagon&amp;#8208;shaped structures – small in footprint, but whose design results in comfortably sized homes living as an intentional community.

The homes are designed to be affordable for present and future generations for two reasons: 4 homes share a lot conventionally made for one home and two, the land is not owned by the homeowner but held by a local Land Trust.

Designed for today’s ecoconscious urban families, couples, or individuals seeking a way to live sustainably, the Earth Harmony Habitat harvests all its own electricity and rainwater, capture and compost all its own wastes and water, and grow all its own vegetables within an annual basis.   The homes represent a way to flourish within an equitable amount of earth’s carrying capacity without sacrificing the comforts of modern life.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22319&quot;&gt;Eco-village Moldova&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Affordable, green co-housing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/eco-village-moldova/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/eco-village-moldova/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are a diverse group of people, striving for a more sustainable lifestyle and committed to building an organically evolving eco-community in rural Moldova. An important aspect of our community is a social and educational focus. 

Since 2014 we've built a residential eco-house for the first 2 pioneer families living on site and a straw-bale common house for public events and small-scale trainings (up to 25 participants). Two families are trying the co-housing model on site and another family built a wooden house with a thatched roof in the neighborhood. We hope these pioneer families would become an 'anchor' and a resource for future members interested to join and develop Eco-village Moldova. With that in mind, we are investing in public spaces for common activities and in organizing training events. In 2015 we've organized a number of   organic gardening and eco-construction workshops, as well as hosted interns and volunteers interested in sustainable lifestyle and community-building.

In 2016 we plan to build the Environmental Training Center (low or zero Carbon) with a capacity to host trainings for up to 50 participants at a time. Built from natural materials (wood, reed, clay, lime), the Center would have a big training room, dining area, well-equipped kitchen and some accommodation facilities for training participants and volunteers. Here we will hold practical workshops focused on environmental awareness and action, natural construction, eco-system restoration, and community building. 

As more families decide to join, our concept of community will be expanding to include more co-housing units and members living in eco-homes spread throughout the neighboring village, but sharing similar values and principles. For the cohousing units, we aim at small, but comfortable, energy efficient, affordable homes, built from natural materials with extensive shared facilities for adults and children. We are also trying to incorporate principles of permaculture in designing the green spaces between houses. 

In parallel with design and construction, we're still working on our group cohesion and developing internal structures and processes.

Some of the photos below are from one of our site visits during the summer of 2013. The others are from our experiments in eco-construction materials.

Hi There!
We are a group of people who are looking to set up a community of people who wish to live together in a free, peaceful, loving environment that is creative, and real.

Our intention is to offer a space for people to live in peace and find what is right and true for them. A place for people to reflect on life and feel their way. It will be a place where people can really be themselves, to live creatively, freely, openly and honestly. A place that welcomes and invites true expression and 'realness'. A place where people can choose to live simply, with nature, cultivating their garden and watching the clouds drift by.

There will be the possibility for people to stay for short periods, or for long periods of time and for people to make Freeriver their home. Life will become very simple and natural, like a tribe people will begin to become a family and develop close meaningful relationships. 

We've added lots of new things to our website and have some new members on board, please see for more details- freeriver.org 

Freeriver is a charitable venture and looks to offer all that it can for free. With help from donations, and contributions of skills, together we can create something truly beautiful. If this sounds like something you wish to support please email freerivercommunity@hotmail.com for more details. Peace and love.
&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <name>Coweeta Heritage Center</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22321&quot;&gt;Coweeta Heritage Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; CHC's mission is to teach strategies for self-reliant living in order to reduce impacts on our environment. This is best expressed by the term Voluntary Simplicity or learning to live with less.  As I mentioned the second goal is to help heal the earth and each other.  Eventually this might include becoming a retreat center and offer programming for those interested.  The organic garden here produces lots of greens and other produce which helps provide healthy local food for our community.  The 1/5 acre garden can produce as much as 50 pounds of salad mixes, greens, onion, garlic and more weekly.  The garden is also a resource for those interested in learning to care for the earth and heal oneself through organically grown foods and working intimately with the environment. More on what it means to come here: 
Coweeta is a place of healing.  It pure spring waters, the sounds of water flowing, birds singing, clouds sailing by are music to your soul.  Coweeta is a place to get lost and found; tucked away in an intimate valley with little human activity.  It is the perfect place to rediscover who you are and your place in the natural world.  It is a place where cell phones don’t work and your watch may lose time.  It is a place to park your car and walk.  

Coweeta’s beyond organic gardens teach you to nurture yourself and the earth.  Each year tons of leaves are incorporated into the soil to feed the hordes of micro and macro organisms that feed the plants that are grown. Nourish your body and spirit with food you help grow and harvest.  

Coweeta’s gardens also help feed the local community and this is the perfect place to connect with folks and share the bounty of the earth and invite them to come to Coweeta to visit.  Coweeta is a place of sharing.

Coweeta is a place to gather your energies to do the work that nurtures your spirit and contributes to the good in the world whatever this may mean for you.  

Coweeta is a place of spirit, in the trees, rocks, animals, water and air.  Drink in the beauty and spirit here to nourish your soul.  Quiet your mind and be open to the spirit and energies of life around you.

Coweeta is also a place to engage in meaningful work.  With your hands you can help create a place of shelter, paths to walk on, beds to grow healthy food in, contributing to a welcoming community.  Yes, this takes work and some sweat and tears at times.

Coweeta is a place that will grow in you and you will grow in it.  Caring for something means that you become part of it.  This can be as simple as picking up branches that have fallen on roads or paths, building a rock wall that will last a century or more, gathering leaves for the garden each year to enrich the soil, or just sitting quietly in a spot you have chosen.  

Coweeta is a place to learn new things and apply what you learn to doing the “good work” of living simply so that others can simply live.  It is a place to learn to feed yourself from the earth.  

Coweeta is also a place of cleansing.  Of giving away habits that may keep you from living as free and healthy a life as you can.  Let the peace and quiet and companionship of the world fill your heart.  Give yourself entirely to the earth and it will fill your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/coweeta-heritage-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/coweeta-heritage-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Coweeta Heritage Center/Talking Rock Farm is a school, working farm and homestead.  Our goal at CHC is to help preserve the cultural history and natural beauty of this area. A second goal is to become a healing community for both the earth and each other.  I am looking for long term volunteers or permanent members.  Please contact me if you are  interested.  I will consider individuals as well as families. 
 
CHC are located in the Nantahalla Mountains of the eastern side of the Blue Ridge Mountains, 10 miles south of the town of Franklin, North Carolina (120 miles N.E. of Atlanta, GA and 70 miles west of Asheville, NC). The center's 32 acres lie in the heart of a small valley with a stream fed by numerous springs and surrounded by national forest. The stream provides water for our hydro-electric system. We are off-the-grid. The area is home to wild turkey, deer, bear, and has one of the largest diversities of plants anywhere in the world. Huge chestnut stumps, remains of 1800 log cabins, mill raceways, spring houses, century old farming roads, and old still sites, are reminders of a people and a way of life based on an intimate knowledge of the environment and those skills needed to survive. 

Paul is a former teacher of Industrial Arts and Technology Education and is well versed in woodworking. He is working on developing appropriate building techniques that incorporate the log construction styles of the past, as well as alternative energy systems. The center has its own saw mill to provide lumber for building projects which may eventually include cabins, a workshop, and a small conference center for retreats and programming. 

Daily life includes organic gardening, aquaculture (trout), basic building skills, wildcrafting, preserving foods, off the grid living, permaculture, crafts (wooden spoon production), saw milling, and other practical living skills for sustainable living.  I currently don't have goats but would be willing to have them again with others to help care for them.  The chickens went with my wife. I would like to have chickens again with others help.

My current goal is to invite others who would be interested in starting an intentional community.  I'm open to discussing what this might be and hearing the ideas of other interested folks.  It would be a work in progress and I am trying not to have an agenda starting out.  Temporary housing  would be needed if other wanted to join.  Permanent housing could be built as needed.  

My focus has been and will continue to be on education, growing healthy food to share with the community through our tailgate market and health food stores.  I currently work with the county summer camp program teaching wood working with kids.  It is lots of fun.  This summer I will teach with the Little Middle Folk School at John C. Campbell Folkschool.  This will be my 13th year doing this.  I also participate in heritage festivals, the Foxfire Museum, and craft shows.  I recently led a program on Humanure composting with our Eco Forum monthly at the Unitarian Fellowship in Franklin.  I have conducted tours of our property and gardens for many years.  

I have suspended our very short term volunteer program until others become involved to help with the program.  It has been a real blessing as well as a challenge to work with many young people who have come and stayed with us over the past 12 years.  I am open to year-long internships with the possibility of joining as a permanent member.  I hope to have short term volunteers in the future.  I welcome folks who would like to visit.

      <name>The San Diego Wake Up House</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22325&quot;&gt;The San Diego Wake Up House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The intent of our community can be summarized by one word &quot;support&quot;. We are here to support one another on our respective spiritual journeys with the practice of mindfulness meditation. We do this within the mission statement of the Wake Up Movement: &quot;Young Buddhists and non-Buddhists for a Healthy and Compassionate Society&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-san-diego-wake-up-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-san-diego-wake-up-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
As we see it, spiritual fulfillment is intrinsically interrelated with social justice and environmental sustainability. So we do our part to speak out against social injustice while we do our best to be sustainable (recycle, compost, grow our own food, shop wisely, eat healthy, etc). We are also all vegetarians on the border of being vegan. However, all of our actions are going to reflect where we are with respect to our spiritual condition, so we do our best to practice: &quot;Peace in oneself, peace in the world&quot; -Thich Nhat Hanh. 

Our aspiration is to &quot;be the change we want to see in the world&quot; -Ghandi.
We also see our home as a resource for the community. We open up our doors to practice meditation together every Friday. 

We love to cook and share meals together. We shop together, clean &amp;amp; do chores together, play board games together, go out to eat together, dance together, etc... We all own bikes, love to hike, camp and get out doors! We have a community garden in the back yard with many fruiting trees (fig, avocado, guava, pear, apple, orange, lemon &amp;amp; lime).

We have couchsurfers and friends sleeping in the common areas constantly. However, we have a balance of privacy and all guest's stays over 1 night must be approved by all house mates for it to occur. 

We are located just west of highway 163, south of Genesee and east of Linda Vista road. Our house is a decent sized 1-story, 5 bedrooms, 3 baths and two huge common areas (one of which is a dedicated space for meditation, yoga and community activities). We generally have 6 housemates including 1 couple. 

Check us out if you ever want to stay here &amp;amp; practice with us! Find us on Facebook!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22327&quot;&gt;Amabel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; New Earth Living creates vibrant neighborhoods that connect people to one another and our
shared earth, providing spaces for trust, purpose, play, and ease. The Amabel Pocket
Neighborhood is one of those places. Amabel addresses the need for low-carbon living,
healthy and delicious food, energy and resource renewal, and meaningful social connections.
To this end, New Earth Living will build 30 fee-simple homes on individual parcels to create a
neighborhood that fulfills a need for privacy and tranquility along with supportive, enlivening
relationships; conserves natural resources; reduces greenhouse gases; and produces food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/amabel/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/amabel/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Amabel Pocket Neighborhood project will provide 30 single-family homes on a gorgeous
piece of land close to downtown Ithaca, the beautiful Cayuga Lake, Buttermilk Falls State park,
the Ithaca Farmers’ Market, Greenstar grocery, shopping, restaurants, and many other
destinations reachable by walking, bike, canoe, or kayak. The houses are arranged to allow
private enjoyment of the site’s exquisite natural beauty while simultaneously creating
opportunities for interactions among residents and visitors. Growing and enjoying food, solarenergy
production, and community-building practices are also key components of this cuttingedge
neighborhood.
The Amabel project is a venture of New Earth Living (NEL) LLC, a real-estate development
company founded by Susan Cosentini. New Earth Living previously built the highly
successful Aurora Street Pocket Neighborhood in the City of Ithaca.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22328&quot;&gt;Grace Sustainable Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; G.R.A.C.E. is a student organization taking responsibility to promote Greater Resource Awareness through Communication &amp; Education. G.R.A.C.E. is currently 188 youth members; (85) YHS alumni, 2014-15 and (103) students currently enrolled in Environmental Science at Yap High School and expected to graduate 2015-16.  Students are all introduced to Permaculture Principles of design through a variety of rigorous integrated projects including site mapping, socio economic survey and complex statistical analysis.   G.R.A.C.E. students understand their dynamic role on the ecosystem and confirm this by pledging to make improvements on their home sites to decrease their negative environmental impact, as formulated in class.  As part of their G.R.A.C.E. efforts student members are soliciting contracts from local agencies and community members for site repair projects, biodiversity surveys and rejuvenation projects such as sea wall, stone path and taro patch regeneration.  These students are also making strides to get involved in the state and national policies that effect sensitive environmental issues facing us today.  November 5, 2015 10 students witnessed at a public hearing on Fruit Bat Conservation in an attempt to make all of Yap a sanctuary. In response to this experience, G.R.A.C.E. will make strides to promote the goals under the Micronesia Challenge of protecting 20% of terrestrial resources by spreading awareness in our communities.  Recognizing that bats play a keystone role as pollinators and seed dispersers in local forest ecosystems, GSC has dedicated more than 250 acres of combined lands to be used as a Sanctuary for Biodiversity rehabilitation, Conservation and Preservation of the Native Terrestrial Forest, which will be surveyed, logged and replanted by G.R.A.C.E. students as community service obligation.  These students are representative of the whole island since Yap High School is the only state public high school, every municipality and most villages, including outer and neighboring islanders are represented by G.R.A.C.E.  For this reason we have a greater ability to get environmental awareness and local issues to be heard in the community from the voice of the youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/grace-sustainable-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/grace-sustainable-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Grace Sustainable Community will be a nonprofit organization designed to help revitalize a Yapese village in Micronesia. The originator, Molly McAFee-Bandag, a former Peace Corps volunteer on the island, and her Yapese husband, Joseph Bandag, will live on site during development.  The project combines traditional Micronesian knowledge, with an understanding of the environmental impacts of land use, sustainable permaculture development, and renewable energy technologies.  Focusing on long term sustainability and GREEN living, the farm will provide a model for easily implemented local projects in these areas:
•Organic Chicken Farming
•Renewable energy
•Waterway management
•Hydroponic and Aquaculture projects
•Experiential education programs

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22329&quot;&gt;SmallWorld Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to discover and create innovative business and employment opportunities for Cambodian youth in an open and casual work environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/smallworldu/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/smallworldu/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a youth-based learning and investment community, ages 18 to 30. Participating elders of all ages and nationalities act as role models, mentors, instructors, advocates and supporters. Our planned rural land base is a ground-up design opportunity, with anticipated rural locations in Mondulkiri and Kampot Provinces.

Cambodia can seem easy to write off as an impossible alternative, but those who know Cambodia understand differently. Personal and institutional regulation is minimal, costs are relatively low, while the majority of people still understand the simple way of life. Acquiring a long-term visa is simple process, it's inexpensive, and easy to extend indefinitely. Urbanized Cambodians are eager to speak English, while the nation as a whole uses US dollars alongside their own monetary system.

Less than fifty years ago, modern Cambodian civilization was completely destroyed. A communal way of life remains as an ancient tradition, while Western urbanization only now is beginning to slowly creep in. With this first post-war generation, the majority of youths remain traditionally minded, modest, respectful of elders and foreign visitors. Public infrastructure is quickly evolving, while outside investments are pouring in. The benefits of a stable and well entrenched, local informal economy are still available alongside the emerging International commercialism.

Our leadership holds a lifetime commitment with a vision of hope for future generations. At present, we operate a well-established urban youth training and business incubation center. Having little guidance, rural youth gravitate toward universities and the urban experience. We encourage qualified adults in all fields to join us in mentoring youths toward reaching their hopes and dreams. Our community home office and learning center is located in Phnom Penh, while our long-term objective is to establish and build our rural campus and agricultural base. Our eco-village campus concept has a mission to reach, teach and prepare youths to accept challenging opportunities for creating a sustainable future in both agriculture and technology.

Due to recent wars, genocide, and famine, Cambodia is known throughout the world to have a notorious image. Nearly all worries and concerns outsiders have today are exaggerated and unfounded. Long-time residents know Cambodia is a safe and an extremely friendly country where foreigners are treated with dignity and respect.

Visiting participants at SmallWorld pay their own expenses while we assist with cultural orientation and lifestyle transition. Living expenses in Cambodia start as low as 500 USD per month.</description>

Located on a 6.5 acre wooded lot 600 feet off main road in rural Sanford NC, for sale for an intentional living community.  Several acres have been cleared for food production. We have reached an age where this is not possible for us any longer and would love to see the dream of sustainability move forward.  There is a 2-3 bedroom house (2 baths) and a mobile home (3 bedrooms 2 bath) along with a storage trailer and garden shed on the property.  please contact Dr. AJ at 646 420 0777

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22331&quot;&gt;Le Manoir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Le Manoir is an quebec income sharing intentional community. It supplies shelter (one shared house) and healthy and responsible food (mainly grown on site) to its members. It offers its members a different social environment to experiment new ways to live together and to develop their full potential, while having an impact on their extended community.

The vision we have for le Manoir community is a balance of the following 5 principles:
- Human relationship
- Social Justice
- Nature
- Autonomy
- Openness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/le-manoir/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/le-manoir/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Le Manoir is an income sharing intentional community project. It aims food and energy sovereignty and plans to be fossil fuel free in a horizon of 20 years. It is based on egalitarian, anti-capitalist, anti-authoritarian, feminist and activist values. As so, it is meant to be an active member of its larger community. In concret terms, le Manoir consists in one residence, large enough to host a minimum of 12 permanent members. This collective living space allows for sharing and practicing a healthy and enriching way of life that sustains each member's well-being and thriving and thus life in general. Inspired by principles of permaculture, radical simplicity, non-violent communication and anarchist practices and theories, this space is one of experimentation.
Le Manoir community plans to settle on a piece of land in rural Quebec by 2016.

We have a land, soon in common. We also have an organic farm on the land. We are eager to share any information we  might have, or answer any question you might have.

Please visit our website for more information. It is french only, but you can read our vision statement in english at this adress: manoir.community/vision/en

*******************************

Le Manoir est un projet de communauté intentionnelle québécoise à revenu partagé. Elle vise l'autosuffisance alimentaire, énergétique ainsi que l'indépendance au pétrole, dans un horizon d'environ 20 ans. Elle se veut égalitaire, anti-capitaliste, anti-autoritaire, féministe, activiste, membre à part entière de la communauté élargie. Plus concrètement, cette communauté consiste en une seule résidence pouvant accueillir minimalement une douzaine de personnes, en milieu rural. Ce lieu de vie permet le partage et la mise en pratique d'un mode de vie sain et enrichissant, visant le bien-être et l'épanouissement de chacun-e de ses membres et de la vie en général. Inspiré des principes de la permaculture, de la simplicité volontaire, de la communication non-violente et des théories et pratiques anarchistes, c'est un espace d'expérimentation.

Nous sommes bientôt collectivement propriétaires de notre terre. Ça fait depuis 2016 que nous y habitons. Nous avons aussi une ferme bio sur la terre où certain-es d'entres nous travaillons. Nous vous invitons à visiter notre site internet (manoir.community), sur lequel nous ajoutons régulièrement des articles qui couvrent l'avancée de nos démarches (visites, conférences, formations), des études de cas (communautés existantes mises en relation par rapport aux valeurs importantes pour nous), et des réflexions.

We aim to be a living model for social, economic, and ecological justice and sustainability.
There are three main pillars to our work:
1. collective ownership, of residential, commercial, and manufacturing properties;
2. shared commons, including physical space, services, food-related resources, and knowledge; and
3. social enterprise focused on food production, preparation, and retail, including commercial and cooperative activity aimed at fulfilling social and nutritional needs while producing wealth and creating jobs within the local community.

PDX Commons is an urban cohousing condominium development in one of Portland's great neighborhoods. This is a four-story new building situated around an enclosed garden courtyard and common house.  There are 27 units (1, 2 and 3 bedrooms) ranging from 650-1250 square feet. The neighborhood includes grocery stores, trendy shops, popular restaurants, music venues and brewpubs. It's the ultimate in walkability (95 Walk Score). We sit directly on the #15 bus line for excellent public transit. The Sunnyside Belmont neighborhood is a vibrant, dynamic place in the inner heart of Portland, constantly rated as one of the most livable cities in the US.  Designed for active adults, we are a 55+ community. The units and building are designed for age-in-place and age-in-community. Many of our Commoners still work in their professions but are close to retirement.  We are teachers, nurses, therapists, doctors, lawyers, developers, financial expert, consultants, environmental specialists with an international sommelier to sort out our wine choices.  We are generally liberal leaning (as one might expect in Portland) though it is certainly not a requirement.   Members began moving into the building in July, 2017.  The project is currently sold out. A waiting list is available. Come check us out. pdxcommons.com

We are not set up for overnight visitors. 

We value communication, cooperation, personal space, spirituality without dogma, achievable goals, common visions, work, play, laughter, music, and sharing.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22339&quot;&gt;Enright Ridge Urban Eco-village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Mission Statement: Enright Ridge Urban Ecovillage seeks to be an ecologiaclly responsible community sharing ideas, resources, and a reveranece for Earth.

We are an urban retrofit ecovillage.  We support each other in living sustainable lives and seek to be a demonstration on the way city neighborhoods can become more community oriented and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/enright-ridge-urban-eco-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/enright-ridge-urban-eco-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
ENRIGHT RIDGE URBAN ECO-VILLAGE
CINCINNATI, OHIO

In 2004, Imago, an ecological education organization on Enright Ave. brought 17 residents together to start an ecovillage in the neighborhood. They came together and committed to developing a neighborhood that valued a sense of community and would become a destination neighborhood embodying green sustainable living practices, as well as a model for revitalizing other urban neighborhoods.  Its mission: Enright Ridge Urban Ecovillage, Inc. seeks to be an ecologically responsible community sharing ideas, resources and a reverence for earth.

The ecovillage was founded in 2004, became a tax-exempt organization in 2007. Tt is located on four dead-end streets just minutes from downtown Cincinnati.  Enright Ave., the first street we settle on is a ¾ mile long with 80 houses and 90 households in an inner ring neighborhood,. Terry St. has seven houses and eight households and McPherson has fourteen houses with seventeen households.  35% of the residents are involved with the ecovillage 25% are open and 40% indifferent.  There is no opposition because the neighborhood is a wonderful place to live because it is an ecovillage.  

Housing prices and rentals are reasonably priced.  We have acquired 15 buildings with 25 units that were foreclosed. We have rehabbed them and sold most to home owners, some we have kept to rent to people interested in the ecovillage.  We used creative financing to purchase the first home, then came across a foundation that has lent us money for purchase and rehab, repaying it when we sell the house.  Eighty-five percent of the houses in the ecovillage are owned by homeowner. We do not control who buys into the ecovillage, but most people who moving here do so because of the ecovillage.  We have had a good number of young families with children move into the ecovillage over the years. 

We have created an urban CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) project in and around the ecovillage, using backyards and lots.  We have two farmers working for us and an intern.  We have 60 shares, serving around 150 people.  Shares are not restricted to the ecovillage.  We see the urban CSA model as the best way to grow a significant amount of food in our urban areas, and also provide employment to farmers.  Two of our CSA members have written a book called: “Starting Your Urban CSA, a Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Community-Supported Agriculture Project in Your Urban Neighborhood.”

In the late 1800’s a pub was opened across the street from what is now the entranceway to the ecovillage.  It was a family run bar until the early 2000’s.  At that point a person bought it and ran a disreputable establishment.  When the opportunity came, the ecovillage purchased the pub with the dream of doing a green general store and pub.  The pub has continued, the store is still in the dream stage.  The pub has become a wonderful community gathering place and is the greenest pub in Cincinnati.

With a majority of people now living in cities, we have to find ways of making our cities more Earth friendly.  The urban ecovillage is a great way of doing this. Our goal is to help other urban neighborhoods create their own ecovillage.  We are willing to consult with groups interested in looking at the possibility of creating an ecovillage in their city neighborhood.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22340&quot;&gt;KC ARTS Ecovillage Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Urban Arts Mixed-use Cohousing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kc-arts-ecovillage-project/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kc-arts-ecovillage-project/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Vision Statement
We are a community incubator for practical ideas and experimentation that leads to more intentional living and more environmentally sustainable knowledge for members and the Kansas City community as a whole. Interconnectedness, respect, open mindedness, and eco-conscious ideas guide our collective evolution.

 

Mission Statement
The KC ARTS Ecovillage Project seeks to create one or more intentional living communities with our three core principles in mind.

 

Core Principles
Community
We want to live together as a community and as part of the larger KC community. We want to work in collaboration with other existing and forming groups and initiatives.

 

Sustainability
We want to explore ways to live more sustainably in an urban and/or rurban environment, both as individuals and as a community.

 

Arts
We believe that art and play brings people together and that it can transform community and help create a sense of place in an urban location.

 

Objectives
Attracting a diverse group of individuals and families who are excited, energized, and committed to implementing the Vision;
Devising governance that allows members to share responsibilities and decision making
Create financial structures that allow for and foster the participation of a diverse group of people who are committed to living harmoniously with each other and the natural world;
Building connection among community members through the sharing of some meals, resources (non-monetary), music, art, dancing, and creativity
Confronting realistically and creatively the legal, financial, and interpersonal challenges to creating such an Ecovillage, and by infusing joy into the process of working and playing together to overcome all challenges
Identifying critical ecological problems, finding solutions and implementing them in our Ecovillage
Consider the environmental costs of our choices of what we use, and by reducing our use of non-renewable energy and other resources
Design and build structures that are attractive and inviting, sustainable, artistic and integrated into the natural environment


Project Status
After solidifying our vision and finalizing our legal structure, the community is currently working on the following items:

 

Determining our price range/buying power
Documenting assets and constraints/limitations
Creating a high-level budget
Determining and solidifying sources of financing
Inviting additional members into the community
Researching local zoning, codes, and permits
Investigating and selecting a physical location for the community
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22341&quot;&gt;Willka Hampi (previously Project Taruka)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; - Recovery of Tradition - Authentic Leaders - Sustainable Communities
Our desire is to participate to the global movement currently appearing in our world. This movement, which has long been prophesized by many ancient and authentic traditions and cultures, foresees a great change in humanity; a shift of consciousness which marks the beginning of a Golden Age.

This new era defines new ways of relating in harmony with life, nature and each other in the consciousness of our real identity and human purpose. The time of this prophecy is now emerging with more and more people drawn to living an ecological and self-sufficient life-style within a community or clan, like our ancestors did.
We understand that by serving this global project of humanity each one may find their personal healing within a particular collective weaving. Therefore, our aim is to serve the magic of the healthy dynamic of life, woven between families, communities and projects for a flourishing new society of healthy and awake individuals.
In order to complete with this, our primary focus is dedicated to help people encounter their true motivations and hidden potentialities to serve life and its sacred global movement as an authentic leader, educator, or medicine person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/project-taruka/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/project-taruka/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a culturally diverse community living in the majestic Sacred Valley of Peru (near Pisac, Cusco). 
Our community started to appear about 20 years ago and is now well established.

Our main service is running our formation center (of the mystic arts and sciences of life) which works with ancestral traditions and sacred plant wisdom to make appear leaders, medicine people and a web of communities inter-related around the world. 

Our projects include Shamanism, Leadership, Self-Sufficiency (e.g. organic agriculture, eco-construction such as adobe and tipi, permaculture, ethical trade), Natural Therapy &amp;amp; Medicine, Education, Ecological Science, Inter-Community Weaving, among many more.

We welcome people to encounter our community and projects through our programs. These programs particularly suit those who want to establish their own eco-community, be a leader or shaman, develop themselves in particular science such as medicinal plants, or encounter the skills &amp;amp; knowledge to be a valued member of an established community. 

We offer a long-term formation process (with or without medicine ceremony) where one can eventually integrate into the community as a family member. We have various sites and lands for the expansion of our projects and community and take on a few people each year to integrate into our community on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. 

Our community functions on the base of a traditional clan structure (based on the Sacred or Medicine Wheel) which puts emphasis on the dynamic of the circle. We work with several authentic traditions under a universal and inclusive vision.

Shamanic/ spiritual activities include sweat lodge, communal chanting and meditation, and sacred plant ceremonies.
 
All those staying at our community must abstain from consuming meat, poultry, fish, drugs and alcohol on the premises and follow community rules.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22342&quot;&gt;Heartbeet Lifesharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Heartbeet is a vibrant lifesharing Camphill community and licensed therapeutic residence that includes adults with developmental disabilities and interweaves the social and agricultural realms for the healing and renewing of our society and the earth. Community members live and work together, in beautiful extended family households, forming a mutually supportive environment that enables each individual to discover and develop his or her unique abilities and potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/heartbeet-lifesharing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/heartbeet-lifesharing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Located in Hardwick, Vermont, on a 150 acre farm, Heartbeet is a licensed Therapeutic Community Residence recognized by the State of Vermont and has recently been incorporated into the Camphill Association of communities,where everyone, regardless of ability, can find meaning, dignity, and delight in life. Long-term volunteers, adults with special needs, and volunteers who come for a year of service work, learn and play together, celebrating the myriad joys and challenges of life. In Vermont the land is full of rolling mountains and hidden valleys; towns are small and people have to make an effort to reach out to each other. People care about their neighbors and are willing to stand up for what they think is right (we still haveTown Meetings). From its inception Heartbeet has fit right in and is committed to building relationships and cultivating all that is best in the small-town community way of life. Driving up our steep hill, the road opens onto a beautiful view of fields and forest, swim pond and red barn, and three lovely homes. You get the feeling that you have arrived in a place alive with the wonder and joy of the earth and human relationships.

The work we do at Heartbeet is based on a spiritual understanding of the human being, the earth, and the universe. Anthroposophy (literally &quot;the wisdom of the human being&quot;) was conceived by Dr. Rudolf Steiner of Austria in the early decades of the 20th century. Anthroposophy has inspired  innovations in many areas of life, and has given rise not only to Camphill communities, but to Waldorf education, biodynamic agriculture, and new forms of medicine, therapies and the arts. All share a common dream of social, cultural and economic renewal. Our foundation in anthroposophy manifests itself in the recognition that each human being comprises a body, soul, and spirit, and we believe each of these aspects has the capacity to grow, develop and learn. We recognize that each person is on an inner journey, and we can actively support each other by the ways we live, learn, and work together.</description>

Dear Community Seekers,

UPDATE:
This specific house was sold unfortunately to a single family because almost nobody replied to this post and thus I could not find people to buy it with.  It was a one of a kind place, but there will be other special places, perhaps even closer to the city.  I am still interested very much in finding people to start a community with in a similar setting. Thus, let us form a community of like-minded people, agree on a plan and start shopping for a place ! The rest of my description still holds except for anything specific to this - now gone- location.
(end of UPDATE).

I am trying to start a new community from scratch and find 8-10 people who like to live together in an egalitarian community and to buy this truly one-of-a-kind place in Seattle's North Matthews Beach Area (as mentioned above, it is now sold and therefore we have to find something else) together so that we can live free from rampant Seattle rent increases and have a piece of paradise.


My vision is for a multi-generational group of idealistic, curious, open-minded and emotionally invested down to earth people with devotion to good and honest communication (for instance using NVC - nonviolent communication as a guiding principle), who value environmental stewardship, support, serenity, nature, gardening, good food and healthy living and inclusiveness that supports individual identity choice, yet stresses community-mindedness and cooperation and mutual support and a synthesis of spiritual and rational/scientific world view.


If 8-10 people bought the house together, the mortgage may be as low as $320-$400/person (at 5% interest rate for 30 year mortgage). The key is a willingness for community and unfortunately also a good amount of savings, but yet a fraction of what it would take to buy a house by yourself in the Seattle area, much less a house like this.


There is very little time left before this house may end up sold to yet another one-percenter or a sliced up by a greedy developer.


The owners would instead truly love to sell it to a community and keep it available for the common good.

The Template Homestead, an intentional community, was established in 2003. It is a residential community, set on 129 acres, in rural Decatur, Tennessee. 

Its members are also members of the Emin Way, a not-for-profit, and non-denominational, spiritual educational organization (501 c 3).  It is a community, an international gathering of individuals from all walks of life, who are in concert with the belief that human life is a purposeful, spiritual arising, out from an ordered and growing universe.

The understanding of the human’s high purpose is a lifelong discovery process, both as individuals and as a species. We gather around the belief that the universe, God, and the human are an intertwining, evolutary process, each dependent on the other for its progression and refinement.

As artists of life we wish to facilitate awareness through hosting interactive events here at Astral Valley.  We currently are preparing the grounds for these types of events &amp; long-term sustainability &amp; education.  You can visit our website to learn more: www.astralvalley.com

Our Current Projects (always changing as we finish some &amp; start new ones):
- Building Giant Puppets
- Organic Food Production &amp; Storage
- Graphic Designing
- Seeking out &amp; booking Performers, Artists, &amp; Musicians
- Chopping Firewood &amp; Clearing Brush along the Trails for Property Upkeep
- Remodeling Home
- Working on setting up a University Internship program with the local colleges
- Building a Cedar Fence
- Building more Raised Garden Beds, Mulching existing Beds &amp; Orchard
- Landscaping to Beautify Property
- Designing &amp; Gathering Materials for our Green House &amp; Irrigation System
- Designing &amp; Creating Permanent Art Installations here on the property
- Building a Rock Spring House &amp; Gazebo to protect our Magical Spring
- Laying Gravel in the Roadways to keep them Maintained using backhoe, dump truck, &amp; a good ol' shovel 
- Saving Seeds &amp; Drying Herbs for future use
- Making Homemade Wine for our Fun &amp; Consumption - we nearly always have a new batch fermenting :) 
- Event Planning &amp; Coordinating

Ok, we aren't tackling all of these things at once, but through team work, awareness &amp; educated planning we are getting there at lightning speed ;)   We are NOT interested in people that can't help out on a daily basis (weekends &amp; evenings are always off).  Living the Dream is a lot of work and we don't want people to get a misconception.  In order to keep the property comfortable &amp; progress towards an excellent future, daily participation is a must and it takes a team to achieve success as we are all in this together!  If you just want to get drunk, watch TV or play on the computer all day then Astral Valley is NOT for you.  We work hard and play hard together and often spend our days off hosting workshops, community events &amp; drum circles, hiking, camping, canoeing, caving, performing at music events across the country, building art, taking group road trips to places unknown on our magic bus, or simply enjoying our beautiful natural surroundings.       

The Story of How the Astral Gypsies came to Be Here Now...

Once upon a time in far away galaxy, on a far away planet, in a far away land there lived the creatures of Astral.  For millennial they thrived on their beautiful planet, protecting it from the forces of evil that prevailed.  They worked hard to keep greedy power seekers, corporate politics and polluting industries at bay. However, in these final galactic years the Dark Forces were mighty and evil consumed Astral.  Before total destruction transpired a small group of Astral Beings escaped the wrath of the Dark Forces.  Now in destitute they started a journey in search of a greener tomorrow and a new home planet.  They soon became known as The Astral Gypsies.

Their seeking guided them to a magnificent planet in the Milky Way known by the natives to be Earth.  The Astral Gypsies decided to make this their new home and upon arrival they soon found out how spectacular this new planet really was! It was bursting with the essential elements needed for live: water, air, fire, earth, and energy.  However, something else prevailed on Earth that the Astral Gypsies knew all to well, The Dark Forces.  At this time in Earth’s existence the Dark Forces appeared to be just getting warmed up.  The Astral Gypsies knew that if something didn’t change fast Earth would be doomed and soon over ran by evil.

Deciding that it would be a shame to let another magical place be consumed by the Dark Forces, The Astral Gypsies decided to stick around and help out!  At first their concepts seemed as foreign to Earthlings as dry land was to a fish.  They knew they had to get creative if they were going to make a difference. So they started building interactive art to share concepts and help educate. It worked! Earthlings started to look within to find the inter-connectivity of all things and use that knowledge to overcome obstacles. The Forces of the Light are flooding the lands and The Astral Gypsies continue to spread their message.

We invite others to join us and build amazing art that share the secrets of life.  You can do this on your own, with family &amp; friends or with us at the Organic Art Park!  Astral Valley is a 200+ acre piece of bliss that we have been endowed as the stewards of.  The property includes an organic garden, 2 big old houses, caves, crystal clear spring, 1800s barn, creek, pristine pastures, magical forests, swimming hole, lots of wild edibles, &amp; love!</description>

Greetings,

We have recently been given the opportunity to live on approximately 87 acres in southern Ecuador. We are just starting out and in need of just a little bit of help.  There is currently myself, my husband, and our 8 month old son.  We are open to another family joining us and helping us get some basic needs established such as a garden, sharing cooking responsibilities, family responsibilities, animal fencing/housing, etc.

We will be able to provide living space in a bodega or an army tent but you are also welcome to bring your own tent and camp.  We are looking for about 5 hours of help a day and will provide staple foods.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22348&quot;&gt;Fairy Forest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We CHANGED our NAME!  We are no longer &quot;Creative Sanctuary and Freedom Farm&quot; This idea of building a sustainable village in the forest began when I was a 10 years old. Since then I have been many places and done many things, and now I am finally ready to fullfill my childhood and lifelong dream. I never even knew why I had this dream, really, just did. Then six months ago I met someone I could clearly tell was a clairvoyant, and she told me that I am a fairy. She told me as if I should know this already. She was actually shocked when I told her I didn't know! So, I went home and learned as much as I could about REAL fairies. I read online articles, then I read Doreen Virtue's book about incarnated fairies and now everything about me makes sense! NOW I am SO READY to connect with my encarnated elemental brothers and sisters to demonstrate what living in harmony with nature looks like, and help to inspire the world with our other creative passions! This is why we are here. Come, and stay as long as you like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/creative-sanctuary-and-freedom-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/creative-sanctuary-and-freedom-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Step by step, this is to become a retreat from monetary economies and a sacred space to awaken and experience spiritual discovery in environment full of life, love, and inspiration built to inspire a new way of thinking, living, and creating. Its humanity's time to thrive on Earth.  We are currently looking for creative individuals that are truly optimistic and ambitious about making a positive change in humanity as well as spiritual healers and aspiring healers to come and build a strong community of unconditional love for all. We want to share plant knowledge and earthen-house building as a form of meditation. We are attempting to free ourselves from a monetary economy, so others who are on the same path are welcome to come and share ideas on instigating a resource-based economy. We are very peaceful and open-minded people, and we believe that we must be the change that we see in the world. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions! Peace, love and naked squirrels!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22352&quot;&gt;Ed's house&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; __________________ ____________________ ______________________ ______________________ ______________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/eds-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/eds-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
There are 8 of us in a 2 family house on the Cambridge line in
 Somerville. Except for Ed everyone here is a student, a researcher or
 a working professional in their 20's or early 30's. We all get along &amp;
 do things together at times.  The Tuesday night potluck is a nice
 social event of the house. There you can often meet cool scientists
 and artists from Cambridge area.  Other times we may plan a movie
 night, a hiking trip or something else and our friends or extended
 community joins as well. Most often, of course, things just happen
 spontaneously. (There is no mandatory attendance to any function.)
 
We would be an ideal community for those who wish to enjoy living
 together but would not like an overabundance of rules, chores or time
 processing them. At Ed's house, everyone takes responsibilities within
 themselves. We do not have specific chores per se, however, when we
 notice that something needs to be done we assess within ourselves if
 it might be our turn to do it. Same is true with commonly shared
 items. For instance, if you notice that the olive oil is low &amp; you
 haven't bought any in a while you might pick some up the next time you
 go shopping. We each buy our own food but may opt to share any of that
 to the house. Our lives are too busy to fuss about these details any
 more than that. Needless to say, our house is drama free. We realize
 that the harmony amongst us is worth so much more than what any stress
 or tension could ever bring.
 
So write us back if you would like to live with us in our nice old
 house with great people all around you. Hardwood floors to walk on,
 mechanical laundry machines to work for you and a nice old gas stove
 to cook whatever your little heart desires. We are a short 10 to 15
 minute walk to Harvard square and the T, near Inman, 5 min to union,
 15 to porter, 25 to central, on the 86, 83 and a couple others but in
 such a nice quiet neighborhood (just over the Cambridge line in
 Somerville) that you wouldn't know how close you are to everything.
 
We will have rooms that open up now &amp; then &amp; cost between $700 and $1350 per month.
They come with free utils, wifi, internet, laundry etc...

      <name>MendoDragon</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22353&quot;&gt;MendoDragon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; coop permaculture activism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/mendodragon/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/mendodragon/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are a collective of compassionate people who value living in community.  We aspire to appreciate and enhance our home by working and playing together in harmony.  We strive to understand and support each other through heartfelt communication and sharing wonderful, love-laced meals.  Our vision is to serve as a model of cooperative living that actively resists the dominant paradigm of consumerist culture.

Our name, MendoDragon, comes from the Mondragon Collectives of the Basque Region of Spain where successful enterprises that benefit the whole community are cooperatively developed and collectively owned.  MendoDragon is a cooperative housing model with a communal main house, garage/workshop, old barn, orchards and garden beds on two acres located in Boonville.  Sharing purchase, development and maintenance costs offers an affordable alternative to single person households, as well as providing camaraderie and more hands to do the work.  We envision a total of six personal “bed sheds” clustered around the main house and a future new common space and bath house.

Food is security and at MendoDragon we are serious about food, not only growing it but also preserving it, bartering with it and sharing it.  To this end we are actively working on improving the food production systems we already have in place.  Currently, we have a small flock of hens, an established orchard of apple and pear trees, a new orchard of 25 fruit and nut trees, vegetable and herb gardens and beehives.  We host a monthly community potluck that is sometimes large, sometimes small, but always a lovely dinner party.

MendoDragon is affiliated with Cloud Forest Institute, a 501 (c3) educational non-profit.  CFI was established in 1996 to encourage communities in the temperate forests of Northern California and the cloud forests of Ecuador to re-establish balance within our ecological systems.  CFI serves as fiscal sponsor for other non-profits and produces educational programs ranging from yoga retreats in Ecuador to mycology workshops in Boonville.

Additional infrastructure we plan to develop includes: a cob oven, more veggie and medicinal herb gardens, a ceremonial fire circle, grey water and solar energy systems.  We also envision renovating the old redwood barn into workshop spaces.  While there is a vision, MendoDragon is a canvas waiting for co-creation, a community calling out to conscientious collaborators.

      <name>Konohana Family</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22354&quot;&gt;Konohana Family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Spirituality, Oneness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/konohana-family/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/konohana-family/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Konohana Family is an agriculture-based community at the foot of Mt. Fuji where 80 non blood-related members live as one big family (as of 2013 Dec).
In 1994, 20 members found Konohana Farm, which then was renamed to Konohana Family. They aimed to establish a community where people can live together by supporting each other in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka, Japan.
The name “Konohana” comes from the goddess of Mt. Fuji, “Konohana Sakuyahime no Mikoto”. Since its establishment, the family has built a certain life style based on harmony.  All members make full use of their talents in daily life, playing specific roles, and helping each other.


Konohana Family practices organic agriculture, and does not use any chemical fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, or genetically modified technology. We choose a sustainable method that provides a good balance between self-sufficiency and productivity, and paying attention to the natural resource circuits. Our total farm land covers 18 hectares; 9 hectares are for vegetables and grains, and the other 9 for rice. Most of the land is borrowed for free from our local neighbors.
We produce most of our food – 260 types of vegetables, grains, 11 types of rice, free-range eggs, pure honey, and miso (fermented soy paste), soy-sauce, and other processed food, produced with traditional methods. We only purchase sugar, salt, and some spices.
We also use “Konohana-kin” (Konohana-microorganisms), an original cultured microorganism solution based on the Effective Microorganisms (EM), for livestock’s feed and water, which significantly reduces odor and creates a healthy environment overall. “Konohana-kin” is used for fermentation process of natural fertilizers, spraying for crops, and for humans to drink as a lactobacillus beverage for our health.


Konohana Family has taken unique steps for the last 19 years without any specific ideology or model. Recently, it received high recognition as an ecovillage in various aspects for its initiatives such as: the environmentally friendly life-style that achieved high self-sufficiency of food based on organic agriculture; harmonious community building based on high-level of spirituality; a mutually-supported system based on common economy, and spirituality that is deeply rooted in the daily life without belonging to a specific religion or denomination. These aspects have attracted attention domestically and internationally.

SoNNoS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Healing via Huna, Higher self connection . meditation, prayer Organic Community, Spirit of Nature&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/global-natives-at-mt-sonnos-spirit-of-nature/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/global-natives-at-mt-sonnos-spirit-of-nature/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Global-Natives at Mt. SoNNoS is part of an interconnected network of communities, most in the early formative stages. The core of these communities' philosophy is the BIOversity - a place of alternative teaching and learning that promotes alternative, we consider more fruitful and fulfilling, ways of living with a deeper, more respectful and spiritual connection with Mother Earth. 

We are very few permanent residents, but many more transient visiting Global-Native tribal members from across the globe. People often stay from just days to weeks to months, but hopefully we can establish a larger core of more permanent years-long members.

We aspire to become more self-reliant but not isolating or insulating ourselves from broader, more conventional society. We maintain completely open doors and, at this point especially, strive to plant seeds of inspiration in the hearts and minds of all visitors, whether from the local, national, or global community. 

By Western standards, our lifestyle appears very simple, with minimal electricity, appliances, hi-tech gadgetry, or amenities. But our lifestyle is rich and, in many ways, deeply complex as we rediscover our cultural heritage of intimate, community-based living, more connected to our so-called natural environment, striving to daily better understand the daily rhythms of the human and non-human worlds and the beautifully complex plant and animal worlds.

We are off the grid and rural, but easy access and close to big cities.  All of our development will be made to integrate and blend into the environment.  We are building Earth-Integrated housing, community center, food forest, permaculture gardening, natural swim pool, and too many things to list here.  Members pay for a membership, pay low monthly dues to cover taxes and insurance, and contribute a minimum of 4 hours per week toward community determined projects.

We are a small group of women (and our men or families) who live on a 1/4 acre homestead.  We have 2 residential buildings with the 3rd on the way (build to suit). As our name suggests we tend to be mature females who are living and drawn together to support and be there in our golden years.  We tend to be active, artistic and spiritual while enjoying living, planning, playing and planting or tending to our lives and families.  We are active in the town's greater community which lends itself to our way of living.  We are socially involved and are seen by the locals as great examples of an alternative lifestyle.  We are located in a quaint and established neighborhood in a small rural town about 45 miles east of Austin, TX.  We are called the Queen of the Hill, as the neighborhood is called &quot;The Hill&quot; (Mt. Pleasant) by the locals.  When the 84 households enter The Hill they must pass this house which happens to be located on a corner of the only 2 streets that come and go from this neighborhood.  Also the house is located above the street level and while we are sitting on our porches we view all who come and go from our 'queendom'.  Too funny!

Bay State Commons is a new cohousing community currently forming with plans to build a 30-unit building in the Boston Metro North suburb of Malden, Massachusetts. We hold an Option to Purchase agreement for the American Legion site at 368 Pleasant Street in Malden, MA. We are actively seeking new members as we apply for our permits, with the goal to being construction later this year, and move into our building by mid-2019. The location is 750 feet from the Malden T stop, 20 minutes to downtown Boston and a short walk to groceries, restaurants, public parks, and public and charter schools. It is one mile from the Middlesex Fells, a 2,200 acre state park. 

        We intend to create a cohousing community which fosters group cohesiveness and serendipitous social interaction between neighbors. 

        We envision a community in Boston's Metro North area with a small-town character and an emphasis on beauty in both architecture and landscape. 

        We value a balance between the private and the shared, with individually-owned homes supplemented by extensive common facilities and shared green space. 

        We seek a diverse, multigenerational community with residents who are eager to participate in both design and governance.

Please see our website at www.baystatecommons.org or contact us at baystatecommons@gmail.com to learn more and get involved in this exciting project - now is a great time to get involved!

We are located on 10 acres just outside of beautiful Mazunte in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico.  We have purchased the land and as of January 2014 are just starting to build.

In Lak'ech Village uses a co-housing ownership model whereby community residents have ownership of the ground on which their home sits and fractual ownership of all communal land.


The idea is to build a concious community that values our relationships, our land, and our world.  We will also be building a retreat centre on the land and offering yoga, meditation, and other retreats.

We have good water, numerous fruit trees, ocean views -- it's paradise.  Come visit, volunteer, or live!

The Emerald Village is a chosen family of healers, educators, and creators building space for heart centered community. Our vision is the creation of a home for our members in which everyone contributes, utilizing natural abilities while developing new skills, and sharing the responsibility to maintain the sacred nature of the space. As a group we strive to support each other’s personal, spiritual, and economic growth, to be in service to our greater community, and to be good stewards of our land. We do this because we are passionate about creating a sustainable, conscious environment in which to raise families and deepen our connections with each other, because we believe in the importance of innovation, and because we wish to live a life in which celebration and love are important components of our work.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22364&quot;&gt;Khakalaki Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our focus is self-sustainability centered around the farm. We wish to grow healthy living things as naturally and chemical free as possible, to share and enjoy life and nature. 

We 'work' hard to live well, and to minimize the consumer items we need. We wish to share our vision, our 'work', and inspiration with free thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/khakalaki-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/khakalaki-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
This community was developed as a small organic and permaculture farm focused on self-sustenance, perhaps an aspiring ecovillage. The farming focus has been on humanely growing animals, mushrooms, and Certified Naturally Grown (CNG) produce for community and local farmers markets.

as a former girl scout Campground, the property has numerous improvements that would lend support to an aspiring community group. The campground and local market sales offer income sources. The climate suits for year round growing. Active NRCS grants $20k for roads, high tunnel, fencing.

There is approximately 10 acres cleared and in pasture, working pens orchards, and market garden space. There is another 10 acres of campground with enclosed pavilion/kitchen, 4 treehouses, and RV spots. The remainder of the 70acres are mostly forested with old growth trees along the creek, a spring and a year round creek.  At this time you are invited to purchase this property for your community.

We envision sharing generational benefits, animal and gardening therapy, growing young farmers, and creating areas within the farm that allow transition to off grid, minimalist needs living. Owner available to mentor if desired. 

Our wish is that all who live here can make a living from the farm via cottage industry, internet work, farming, etcetera without commutes or undesired jobs to achieve dispensable consumerism. however located within an hour of Augusta, GA or Columbia SC, 20 minutes to Aiken, SC

We have hosted people who wish to learn including interns, however our time is consumed managing the farm.  We appreciate members who love to learn and share! We have had up to 10 people living here and sharing ideals, homestead lifestyles, meals, and serenity. 

We host events to grow and share. NVC Workshop, Backyard Hog Processing, and Sheep shearing are a few we have done publicly. We sell our products at online farmers market. 

We practice Compassionate Communication and do not judge nor endorse a particular spiritual or cultural inclination. Be as you are if it harms none. If you are drama free, kind, self-sufficient, and willing and able to work towards a common goal of a homestead sharing lifestyle, this farm may be a fit.  Thank you for your time in reading!

The Gathering Inn is located in a small town in Vermont on 2.5 acres at the edge of the Green Mountain National Forest and the White River.  There are 3 buildings on the land including an 8 bed Inn and 4 apartments in two separate buildings. 

We have been on this beautiful property since 2008 and are forming a community to provide a haven from the problems of the planet including the economy, the environment and energy.  We understand the  implications of catastrophic climate change and want to live simply and lovingly.  Our special connection to the land is made stronger by this knowledge.  The property has a permaculture plan in place drawn up by Chuck Marsh of Earthaven.  We have gardens, apple trees, raspberries, a Hugel bed and chickens and ducks.  
The land  is being farmed this season by University of Vermont agriculture graduates
  We are looking for a few more people to join in the work of our times.  It is no longer possible to live ordinary lives in extraordinary times.
&quot;It is time to speak your truth, create your community and be good to each other.  All that you do now must be done in a sacred manner and celebration.&quot;  The Elders, Hopi Nation

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22366&quot;&gt;Harrisonburg Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our vision is to form a community of neighbors interested in knowing each other on a deeper level than typical American neighborhoods. We value our privacy, but recognize that our western culture and lifestyle isolate us from each other and make it challenging to build meaningful long-term relationships with those around us. In building this neighborhood, we want to recapture aspects of a traditional village: knowing each other's names, eating some meals together, sharing and celebrating life together with planned and spontaneous gatherings. In addition, our group strives to live more simply and more lightly on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/harrisonburg-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/harrisonburg-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Thanks for looking into Harrisonburg Cohousing! We can't build a neighborhood without neighbors. We need you! If you'd enjoy living in a small neighborhood with connected neighbors who enjoy some meals and planned and spontaneous activities together, in a place where children can easily run to a friend's house or the neighborhood playground, please visit our website for more information. www.HarrisonburgCohousing.org. 

October 2017 we secured our site close to schools and shopping, and we are excited to continue growing our membership and moving forward with the site process. 

We have our site planning workshop coming up January 27-28, 2018, so this would be a great time to join and help design our neighborhood!</description>

 We are for any who wish to support or be a part of an autonomous association of like-minded, free-thinking individuals and families bonded by oath to each other and united voluntarily in body &amp; spirit as the Tribe of Kelta. For the purpose of not only mutual support and protection but to belong to something greater than one's self and become family as sons and daughters of the Keltan tribe for the generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-tribe-of-kelta/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-tribe-of-kelta/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The founding of a modern tribe.

 If you are a prepper, survivalist, disgruntled vet/patriot or one of the disillusioned, disenfranchised, angry and oppressed masses who no longer claim loyalty to self serving governments and their corporate slave system. You are not alone. 

 I've been working on an idea for a group for a few years. The group would consist of individuals, couples and families who take a personal oath of mutual protection, mutual support, loyalty to each other and to the tribe. Socially it would have a tribal structure and it's members would function as an extended family.

 A group (tribe) of this nature would easily absorb the best ideas and methods of other successful groups into it's own culture making it stronger and more efficient. In any situation whether it be a economic collapse, earth changes, political unrest, societal breakdown or just the daily problems and stress of life, the tribe will be there to give help and support. Through our work and play, good times and bad, our oaths to each other and the tribe as a whole will be an unbreakable bond. This will establish an environment to provide the group support necessary for every member to attain his or her highest potential for happiness, security and personal growth.

  In addition to forming the tribe and building our unique culture, our goal is to acquire land by purchase or donation to establish a tribal community for our members who wish. Over time we hope to build a regional, national and eventually a global network of connected, self-sufficient communities. 
 In these communities we will practice permaculture to live in harmony our environment and have as little unnecessary permanent impact on the land as possible. Our communities will take advantage of all useful technologies and products available such as solar, wind and water power systems, Aquaponics, Internet, communications, etc. to optimize our efficiency, comfort, and effectiveness.

 Through our daily interactions, social interdependence and devotion to tribe and self, we will foster a viable lasting culture for our children and generations to come. 

I'm currently in the beginning phases of this endeavor, and seeking interested open minded individuals, couples, and families to join and participate in its forming or just help by brainstorming this vision with us. Tell us about yourself, skills, past experience, and any other things you can offer to the tribe during its forming and infancy.

When replying please note any helpful knowledge or experience in the following areas.
1. Social Media ( Facebook, YouTube etc. ). 
2. Non-Profit Organizations ( Establishing, Operation, Fund Raising, etc. ).
3. Finance/Marketing.
4. Business Management.
5. Real Estate/Property Law.
6. Any work with Intentional Communities.
7. Civil/Criminal Law.
8. Security/Military. 
9. Bushcraft/Survival.

 I have set up a forum ( http://tribalistic.proboards.com/ ) for those who are interested in neo-tribalism and to aid in the communication and networking between people interested in being a part of this or who are just curious and want to add to one of the topics.

We looking for, SEARCHING around 10 persons to develop a intentional community.

Why 10 persons?

We think that 10 persons is a fair number to know each other properly.
More persons will be very difficult to manage. And less would be not good enough to build a community with a Eco-village project . 

This intentional community have a guidelines or points of view.
We looking for a persons that have these requirements to make the first approach.

Then is quiet necessary to establish a process of adapting to each other.

And finally the last and most grateful thing, of course, if we are very happy together and we have connected each other. Then we could buy/rent/cease/... together a space, whenever possible, a village, a spot, where we could do that, i.e., put in practice the intentional community to a practical, living community.

You will know that's very important to have a “requirements” or things in common. Otherwise we think that the intentional community will have not success. We all know that almost all the communities that break and finish together with the project is because of that, i.e., lack of requirements, lack of affinities, lack of know each other, lack of common ways of life.

We like us to propose two basic requirements:

Pure- Vegetarian ( No eggs)
No Intoxicants of any kind or mind altering drugs

Harbourside Cohousing’s mission is to be a sustainable senior cohousing homeowner community that promotes healthy aging in place. The physical structures as well as the social fabric of our community nurture an innovative culture with lively connections to the larger society. While respecting personal privacy, we foster cooperation, social connection and affordability through design and through mutual support.

Our 2.7 acre waterfront site in downtown Sooke, BC includes 31 strata-titled homes  in 3 duplexes, 3 fourplexes, a three-storey apartment building. A beautiful resort building was adapted to reuse as a 4,000 sq ft Common House. We have land for gardens, additional indoor and outdoor common spaces, and a commercial-style wharf offering moorage to residents’ boats. 

We developed our community to be affordable, aesthetically pleasing, environmentally friendly, and socially/culturally supportive, allowing members to flourish through mutual support (co-care) as we actively age in place and in community.

We choose to manifest a life in which we embody the truth of our interconnectedness with all that is, and we commit all that we are to creating health at all levels of being.  We believe that the Earth is sacred and we have chosen a lifeway in which we are healers of her.  For us, nothing that does harm to her is worth the price that must be paid by the future of all life.  We believe we must expand our concept of &quot;self&quot; to include our family, community, and land.  We choose to become indigenous: saturating the land with meaning and story, animating her, blessing her, realizing we are a part of her.  
From our indigenous, animistic, permaculture story we attempt to bring forth a diverse and fecund ecosystem that will nourish our 'whole body'.  We create food forests, marshes, savannah, and perennially-mulched no-till annual polycultures to re-envision food production.  Using highly efficient heaters, super-insulated naturally built buildings, and appropriate site design we decrease our negative impact.  Our life is our love made evident.

A group of enthusiastic community members are working to advance a walkable urban multi-story project across the Sacramento River from Downtown Sacramento.  Our goal is to create a strong community open to all ages with a blend of privacy and community for those working, recreating, and wishing to live in the Downtown core.  Early participation in our community will give members an opportunity to help shape the character of the community and the design of our project.

Our project site is in the historic Washington neighborhood two blocks from the river, its trails and parkways, just north of the Tower Bridge.  The neighborhood is part of the exciting, emerging riverfront district on both sides of the river.  Downtown Sacramento, Old Sacramento, the State Capitol, and numerous museums including the Crocker Art Museum, restaurants and event venues such as the new Golden 1 NBA arena are a short walk across the bridge from the site.  On the West Sacramento side of the river, in addition to parks and trails, Triple A baseball Raley Field, event venue The Barn, West Sacramento Community Center, Yolo County Library branch as well as shops and restaurants, are within walking distance.

We are growing and expect to begin the architectural design process soon. We are working with national cohousing expert, Kathryn McCamant, CoHousing Solutions.

Come meet with us and explore becoming a member of our community.   As a member you will help us shape our community and project.   Check our website for upcoming events.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22373&quot;&gt;Brotherhood of Christ Church - Essene Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Daily living your Love for God&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/brotherhood-of-christ-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/brotherhood-of-christ-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
We are a present day Essene Community.  We live a primitive, simple life based on our deeply held convictions of keeping the First Commandment and rejecting worldliness.  Each person strives to give 100% of their life to God, not counting the cost, but attempting to make each thought, feeling, and all one's energy given to loving the Lord. We call ourselves &quot;Brotherhood of Christ&quot; because we view Him as our Brother, not because we are patriarchal - we're not.

We are a deeply religious community.  We allow no violence, swearing, drugs, smoking or alcohol use, nor any sexual activity outside the context of marriage. Our religion is soundly Christian, although no one would recognize it as modern, western Christianity because it comes from an ancient background.  We believe in the spiritual empowerment  that Jesus taught in John 14:12 where He said, &quot;Verily, verily I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do.&quot;

No one person leads, but we have a community Council that makes decisions dealing with long term community issues.  There are several other leadership bodies, all of which make decisions by &quot;common consent&quot; which is conditional unanimity.  The mothers of children under 14 make decisions about family needs, medical, special diets, clothing, and other special needs.  The fathers of children under 14 manage all the farming and land usage.  The grandparents or &quot;older elders&quot; decide on matters dealing with equality, parenting needs, education, wisdom and advice.  All men of religious service decide about worship matters.  There is a Storehouse Board made up of members of each of the other groups who decide financial expenditures each month.  Only two people drive or spend money for all the full members in Community.  We keep a version of the Community Rule found in the Dead Sea Scrolls.  We encourage interested persons to listen to our class series Christ View: A Perspective for Christian Community available at the &quot;business, project&quot; link in the upper right corner of this page.  This series gives a good taste of our religious viewpoint.  Hope you enjoy it!

We are a horse and buggy community.  We use draft horses to farm nearly 1200 acres.  We raise almost all our own food, although we still buy salt, sugar (in small quantities), cooking oil, and yeast.  We sew much of our own clothing.  We use horses to power our machine shops and all our equipment, including the laundry houses.

Over the years we have grown into four houses within a few blocks of each other, two of which provide family-style hospitality to people experiencing homelessness, one which offers foster care to children, and a fourth which serves the needs of community and some long-term hospitality. We are also partnering with a medical service provider and a church to soon open a medical respite shelter. We are rooted in the Catholic Worker, with strong influence from community organizing and labor struggles.We engage in anti-racism and housing organizing; grow two city lots of gardens; help facilitate countywide anti-homelessness efforts; and run a no-cost bike shop which sends our 150-200 bicycles every year on a work trade system.</description>

The Foundational Living Colony stands for the &quot;Foundational Truths&quot; found in the Word of God, specifically the book of Genesis Chapter One, where it speaks about CREATION, the SIX DAYS OF CREATION and the DAY OF REST to recover. The Theme of CREATION will flow through the Community as each Day of Creation is emphasised; the &quot;Living&quot; we are promised as Children of God, as Yeshuah the Lord said, &quot;I have come to give them life, and life in abundance!&quot; with the attitude that we are &quot;colonists&quot; on this Earth, who have no permanent &quot;Home&quot;, but seek a greater Homeland; the freedom of creativity, enjoyment, education, teaching, encouraging, entertainment, discipline, and especially SERVICE to God and one another through SHARING with one another what we have, and especially our excess with any in need; we stand for all the ancient practical vocations in life that make it self-sufficient and self-generating which will ALWAYS be in demand for the human body;  Because we grow our own food, medicine, collect our own water, and produce our own children, teach our own children, we are thus able to be completely self-sufficient without the need to buy or sell anymore anything from the store with money, or associate with any dangerous influences or trouble or terror anymore. It is self generating and foundational from the ground up, and includes every establishment necessary for fullness of life, and the self-sustaining life for all of us in the pastoral environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/foundational-living-colony-of-new-eden/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/foundational-living-colony-of-new-eden/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Foundational Living Colony stands for Creation, fullness of life, enjoying life to it's fullest extent, the way it was in the beginning, is now, and will be forever. Foundation stands for the foundational things that make life life, where we are &quot;living&quot; creatures, having many gifts, talents and abilities, working together as a &quot;team&quot; for the building of a habitation of Rest for all people, a self-sustaining, self-generating community, and &quot;colony&quot; is a gathering of people who are &quot;pilgrims&quot; on earth, and like an ant colony works together to build their ant hill, the Colony works together as a team, nobody greater or lesser than the other, but for the sake of equality we work, and are servants to each other. The greatest here will be the servant of all. Service and a life of service is what the Colony is all about. 
 The Living Colony is to have eleven establishments encompassing the full nature of life in enjoyment that will be built. It is a University Campus in form with educational opportunities for all, with a classroom environment and &quot;hands-on activities for each hour of the day, an hour each day set aside for each subject: music, gardening, livestock, carpentry, art, Physician Healing Arts, Bird and Fish environments, military training and discipline, teamwork practice, and Theater and Entertainment:
1. The Resting Deer Lodge- The Lodge is the central hub in the community, where all gather for rest, for a cup of tea, mate, or coffee, to relax and listen to calming music, where people can speak, read poetry, lecture, and be heard. It is a place of meditation, rest and healing for all.
2. The Morning Star Music Hall- The music hall is where all gather for hearing the choir, the musical instruments, and where all dance.
3. The Garden and Greenhouse- The Garden will consist of all 12 vegetable families, the Orchard with Apples and the Vineyard of Grapes; while the Greenhouse will grow the Meditteranean Trees like the Olive tree, Pomegranite, Date Palm, Coconut Palm, Fig tree and more; a medicinal garden of herbs also with Rosemary, Sage, Thyme, Lavender, Valerian, and more
4. The Physician's Healing Center and Apothecary- This center is to have access to all the trees, herbs, and medicines, Gemstones, with Frankinsence and Myrrh, to have all necessary medicines to heal all diseases, give massages, footbaths to release toxins, and more. Vegetarian nutrition is encouraged, the most universal health care for all people.
5. The Architectural Construction Center_ The Construction Center is to have the necessary saw-mills, tools, and instruments for the construction of the Livestock Stables, chicken coops, dog houses, posts, beams, rafters, chairs, furniture, and other items. Universal construction method is the Joint and Tennon method, the most secure and stable method.
6. The Military Training Facility- The Training Facility will train people for military discipline, respect, fitness, teamwork, and good morale among all. There will be excercises, salutes, marching, and battle strategy and battle re-enactments, team sports like basketball, capture-the-flag, and flag football. 
7. The Astrological Space Center- The Space Center will teach people the stars, constellations, signs, seasons, calendars, and the beauty of the Heavens. The twelve constellations of the zodiac will be taught and studied, and the other 88 constellations of the universe.
8. Livestock area and sheepfold- The livestock area will include all necessary livestock: sheep, goats, cattle, and all pets, horse stable with horses. There will be no slaughter of animals, but only the milk, wool, and horse-power will be used. No death of animals will take place but they will be used for what they are. 
9. Fish Marina and Bird Sanctuary- The fish will be stocked in a central pond and a swale or trough dug around the campus, where fish will be. There is to be a continual flow of water sourced by fountain pumps and water wheels to collect water. The central water source is to have a fountain and enclosed by the Resting Deer Lodge in the center. Birds shall have relative confinement but the freedom to fly as the please. Tame birds like parakeets and parrots are encouraged, yardbirds like cardinals and finches also encouraged and fed daily. 
10. Entertainment, play and skit Amphitheater- The entertainment center will be for the entertainment of the people; where plays are enacted, skits, martial arts demonstrations, stories read and characters given lines and parts then enacted in plays. It will bring refreshment to all and lighten the mood for everyone involved. 
11. Resurrection Burial Chambers- Preparation for our dead is necessary and vital. Proper care of any who die is a standard. Bodies are &quot;embalmed&quot; (preserved) with the preservational medicines of Aloe Vera and Myrrh Gum by dipping strips of cloth into an Aloe/Myrrh mixture and wrapping the bodies with that. This is done once every week. We are to care for the body even after death. Burial Chambers are to be built similar to a root cellar, yet with more eloquence. Chambers can be built with concrete slab foundation, cinder block walls, cedar or pine or acacia wood for the roof, and six feet of earth piled on top by a buldozer or a team of shovelers. The Chambers are to have a double-door entrance where those who embalm the dead can go freely in and out at will. This is the standard for all who die and proper care of the body after death. 
These are the eleven establishments for the Foundational Living Colony. All are welcome, young, middle aged, and elderly, all gifts, talents and abilities also encouraged. No one should be left out, but all welcome to engage in this great learning, building, and fellowship practice here. This is for the good of all people, all races, all ages, all men and women both; there is no partiality here. Come one and all and enjoy this process with me. Let us enjoy life again to it's fullest extent and be not hindered by anything. You are free to serve, you are not slaves. Welcome, and come soon!</description>

      <name>The Feedbag Ann Arbor</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22377&quot;&gt;The Feedbag Ann Arbor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; eating together, sharing life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-feedbag-ann-arbor/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-feedbag-ann-arbor/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Established in 2010 on Ann Arbor's Old West Side, our home has been dubbed the Feedbag since we're constantly feeding people. 

We're a household of grad students and working professionals, brought to Michigan for work or school, who wanted to live in a place that was more than just roommates passing in the night.  We share meals, all food and household expenses, and we have herb and vegetable gardens.  We've been known to brew our own beer and cure our own bacon and bake bread and sweet things from scratch.

Our house welcomes a steady stream of local friends and out of town guests, though on an average night, we're more apt to be sitting around chatting quietly over drinks or reading side by side on the couch than out making ruckuses.  We're fond of fruit-picking and vegetable growing and bonfires and leisurely dinners and even the occasional house-cleaning extravaganza.  Some of us play instruments. Some of us knit, crochet or sew. 

We laugh a lot. Sometimes we cry.  Mostly, we just enjoy doing life together.

The community is situated on the edge of Degersheim, a rural village in east Switzerland. It is made up of a lively group of approximately 40 adults and 30 children and teenagers. We have followed a holistic life concept since 2006. Key features include: ecological living, sustainable economy, social structures, spiritual practice in everyday life, art and culture, and integration into wider society. We honor the diversity of each individual, encouraging personal development and inner growing. We aspire to each individual finding and growing into their full potential.

We have a sociocratic organization structure and apply a customized decision making tool called “attunement”. This begins by sharing on a mental and emotional level, followed by a decision making group meditation. Here we access our intuitions and reach out to a higher wisdom, by opening ourselves to receiving information, visions, feelings and body sensations. By sharing these we find the conclusion in a natural way, resulting in collective clarity.

In order to create and maintain healthy relationships in increased consciousness we meet regularly.  Some of the tools we use include: sharing circles, shadow work in triads, the Transformation Game, integral community training (Forum) and ho’oponopono. By following our intuition and experience we have also developed some own tools.

The integration of our children and youth is a crucial ongoing process. Our teenagers are now growing into the next generation of our community.  We are trying to follow the concept of “all mothers and all fathers”: by growing up together there is a shared paternal feeling, resulting in collective nurturing of the younger generation. Children can easily relate to other adults in the community and some choose their ‘own grandparents’. We run integration days with lots of fun and games.

In 2009 we bought an empty sanatorium. We transformed the guest rooms to living spaces for singles, couples, families and groups. We used sustainable materials such as wood, straw, cork, wool, clay, sand and cellulose fibers. We also installed thermal and photovoltaic panels, which means we have more than enough to power the entire building with solar energy. Furthermore, rainwater is collected from the roofs and used for flushing toilets, washing machines and in the garden, thus reducing our water usage by 60%. Organic waste is collected and composted or used for making charcoal for the permaculture garden. We grow fruits and vegetables and are lucky to have organic farms nearby that can fulfill our additional needs all year round.

We try to do all practical work that is needed with care and love. We often celebrate life, all good things and ourselves.

Most members speak schweizerdeutsch (swiss german), but other languages are also spoken: dutch, english, french, german, italian, spanish and even esperanto

Our members have the goal of lessening our ecological footprint through sharing resources and creating community, and we embrace different types of ecovillage projects with that goal in mind. We meet for monthly for site visits, discussions, workshops, or potlucks. We seek to create diverse communities that are broadly inclusive across race, age, income, class, religion and sexual orientation.</description>

A natural alternative to the hectic way of living today, shedding the complications and worry of normal society. By no means a workless environment, but one where what you work for means something to all involved! A true community in every sense! More to come in the coming days as we are forming.


Ok, update time! For those of you following our journey, you'll be aware that we've hit a wall or two. The biggest of which is financial of course. We really would appreciate members WILLING to put as much into our new home as we are. Its never a requirement, but without help, we fear we may never realize this vision. The more that are willing, the easier it will be on all, like every other activity that takes place here. Please consider what you would be willing to put in, and contact us when you feel ready! Namaste!

Major change is upon us brought about by the consequences of over consumption and the commodification of life to feed an economic system that requires endless growth. Climate change, unpredictable weather patterns, peak oil, toxic food production systems, economic disparity, social inequality and mass species extinction are just a few of the consequences that we are facing.  We know the status quo is unsustainable and the future we are currently creating is precarious at best.

At the same time, our hearts know that a more beautiful world is possible.  Only through recognizing our spiritual connection to the web of life around us can we be the change we wish to see in the world.

Vision
A spiritually fulfilling, ecologically and environmentally restorative, socially just human presence on this planet.

Mission
To co-create an equitable, resilient intentional community prepared to face the current and future challenges of our time by living in sacred relationship with ourselves, each other and the web of life around us and in collaboration with other intentional communities. 

About Us  
We are a couple looking for other potential founders. 

Community land has not yet been acquired. Ideally we plan to locate in the Northeastern US on diverse property that offers both woodland and cropland suitable for supplying energy, growing most of our own produce for food, fiber and medicine and allowing space for community growth in the coming years.  The community members will cooperatively own the land, vehicles and other property, with both shared and private living space.

We seek to cultivate much of what we need from the land and each other as well as exchange with the surrounding community through food production, cottage industries/crafts, educational offerings, retail sales, and hosting visitors in a possible hostel and wellness/retreat center.  

We welcome the participation of people of all ages, ethnicities, sexual orientation, gender identification and family structures.  We welcome people of all faiths and honor religious beliefs and practices within the community to the extent that they are harmonious with our principles.


Community Principles
We support each other’s spiritual development.
  
We consciously nurture our individual and collective growing edge and are grounded in the belief that all things must change in order to evolve.  

We take a stand for life with our voices and actions.
  
We live our lives in a way that unravels learned behaviors that contribute to a sense of separation from the web of life around us as well as contributing to oppressive behaviors, systems and structures.

We maintain regular self-care practices like meditation, yoga and exercise in order to practice mindfulness that enhances the collective well-being.

We work with the land and intimately know the land as our home.

We celebrate our sacred relationship with the land through a natural systems-based spirituality - making offerings, asking permission, and engaging in deep listening to our environment in guiding our decisions regarding land and resource use.

We grow a large portion of the organic food we eat using regenerative farming practices.
We are bringing forth an environmentally rejuvenating way of life so that what we do improves the capability of the environment to support life indefinitely.  

Permaculture design and development is a major source of inspiration in meeting our goal of having a net positive impact through radically applying the principles of reduction, reuse, and recycling to all our decisions regarding consumption.

We commit to learning and practicing non-violent, compassionate communication and to engaging in sharing circles.

We participate in circles of engagement for the purpose of creating meaningful discussion, companionship and learning around many different topics and aspects of life and with this awareness we create an environment that allows the possible emergence of a larger “we”. 

We nurture love, respect, joy, laughter, art, music, movement and expression as part of our daily life practice. 
   
Our days are filled with community meals, work projects, rituals and celebrations.

We are committed to inclusive governance and decision-making through processes that are based in distributed authority and shared leadership such as holacracy or sociocracy. 

We continually explore the nature, structure and outcomes of our processes understanding the need for their evolution.

We are committed to offering educational opportunities for our children within the community that respect individual learning paths while nurturing interdependence.</description>

Cherith Brook is a residential Christian community committed to sharing table fellowship with strangers and all our resources with one another. We have found our inspiration from the early church and the Catholic Worker. 

We are a community that practices hospitality, peacemaking, and sustainability. We offer temporary housing, showers, clothes, and a warm meal to our friends from the streets.  We all grow lots of food, care for chickens and bees, and are always looking for more ways to get closer to the land.

Read below for more info:

Our daily lives are structured around practicing the works of mercy as found in Jesus' teachings. We are committed to regularly feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, giving drink to the thirsty, welcoming the stranger, visiting the prisoner and the sick in the name of Jesus.

As followers of Jesus we understand our lives to be centered in God's Shalom. Cherith Brook strives to be a &quot;school&quot; for peacemaking in all its dimensions: political, communal, and personal, working constantly to undo poverty, racism and militarism.

All of these can be summed up as the struggle to connect with the God of life. We pray that Cherith Brook be a space where all of us - the broken - can come to learn and relearn the ways of Jesus; a place to struggle together for God's call of love, mercy, peace and justice.

 By supplying most of our daily physical needs from the land
 While fulfilling most of our social and spiritual needs nearby and with each other&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/farming-in-willamette-valley-region/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/farming-in-willamette-valley-region/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Welcome and good Day. I'm Kevin Jones age 50 and I live near Eugene, Oregon; I've been farming organically and biodynamically and homesteaded for the last 20 years; much along the way has been a journey toward community.
While farming and homesteading, I've noticed again and again that this all would be so much better if it were a group endeavor--More social and rewarding, more efficient, and more sustainable. Farming as I've chosen to, is not a good way to make much money, but it is a great way to feed oneself. I don't import lots of resources or use much machinery so I don't compete in the market place that doesn't value my more sustainable ways. The community farm envisioned would employ draft animals, methane digesters, farm animals, solar and wind power etc, and would have/build the components necessary for a simple yet well functioning farm and community.
  I've searched for compatible communities in my region and around the country. There are some, but not nearby. So I feel called to start one.
They come in all shapes and size, and the one I'd like to be part of growing hopefully will value these ideas or at least allow me to 

~ An awareness of and responsibility to self, relationship with others and spirit.
  (this is hard to distill, yet the key, it involves honor and a commitment to a willingness to accept and resolve differences and challenges in our lives with others and our self; to remain in healthy relation) Striving to live at peace.
~ A consensus approach with consideration for sociocracy and other forms of successful governance. Creation of community rules and agreements including a pet policy
~ A positive long range view, considering future generations
~ Shared land ownership with personal ownership of a home
~ Living a very 'self sufficient' life on a community scale
~ A strong commitment to deriving our needs from our place and
  organic and non GMO foods
~ Choosing a location within easy use of public transportation 
~ Living within our means financially and encouraging those with more, giving more 
~ Creating times of play, fun and joy, and spiritually enriching ceremony

I read a quote by Vandana Shiva &quot;In natures economy the currency is not money it is life.&quot;  And being part of nature and humanity I value money some but life more, especially in respect to time and my ability to participate in much of what I think brings me life and perhaps offers life benefits to others.

 So I'd like to attract and form a core group of compatible people who would like to lay the foundation for an agricultural village (ecovillage.) To start, I'd prefer to make contact with people who have 10+ years of experience homesteading, or living and working on organic, biodynamic or permaculture farms and/or in useful skill trades; and community living experience would be a great asset. I'd prefer to hear from people who reside now in Oregon or the Northwest and who share most if not all of the values I've mentioned

I've lived in community for a short while and have studied many others extensively and would like to encourage the use of the many tools and examples available that appear to be successful. Diana L. Christian's books for example.

So some of my personal interests include finding clever solutions, food and cooking, singing, games, my family, and woodworking with hand tools, basketball, frisbee and tennis, water and canoeing.

Understand, I don't own the land I currently steward, and hope to put my assets with others' to buy land, once trust and agreements have been established.
If you think we maybe compatible, I'd like to talk; please take the first step and call or E-mail me. Maybe a visit to see what we've developed on the land we currently care for will be appropriate.
Thanks, Kevin

This community is forming for those who are ready to heal themselves, others and the Earth. Each member has already apprenticed with a shamanic tradition or is in the process. We offer an apprenticeship for those who would like to live here and have not yet experienced the shamanic tradition. We grow organic food together, cook meals for each other on occasion and enjoy ceremony to heal the Earth. The property has some of the best water in the country. Members can rent or buy adjacent property. 

The rural lifestyle in a quiet, fairly isolated area surrounded by National Forest, requires participants to have some source of income. We are working on a couple of businesses that eventually will employ more people. Smoking cigarettes is not allowed on the property.</description>

VEGAN / VEGETARIAN COHOUSING COMMUNITY

GROUP STATUS : Forming

OPEN TO NEW PEOPLE : Sussex residents only please 


We are in the process of forming a small vegan/vegetarian cohousing community in Brighton in Sussex in the UK and are now inviting more people to join us to make it happen. 



We're looking for people who live in Brighton and are already fully committed vegans or vegetarians, passionate about animal rights and who share our core eco values and left wing world view. 


We need people with different kinds of skills such as gardening, permaculture, building, legal, people skills, herbal medicine, computer etc and who can give time and energy to all aspects of this project and form a close and sharing community.  


Ecological concerns are very important to this community and these would be the driving force behind the installation of high quality solar thermal or photovoltaic panels and or a domestic wind turbine with a feed in tariff, incorporating rainwater harvesting, underfloor heating, a wood burning stove and a communal fruit and veg growing area using permaculture. 


Where renovation and development are necessary, recycled and or locally sourced building materials will be used together with maximum energy efficiency measures. 


There will be composting and there could be a compost toilet. 
 

Rescued chickens and domestic animals as pets will be welcome. 

If you are interested in joining veganiccohousing you must be vegan or completely vegetarian which means no meat or fish at all and you must live in Brighton . . . 

For more info, including a schedule, property and buying options please visit our new website : veganiccohousing.com

We are an Organic Farm that has a few animals(goats, chickens and bees) But we are more than that we are a spiritual Community that gathers twice a day at our Cabin to sing, share our hearts, and pray.
  We share a common life together based on the teachings of Yahshua, the son of God, actually doing the things that He commanded His disciples to do when He walked on the earth 2000 years ago. And, in a nutshell, what He commanded us to do is to love one another as He loved us. Not only is that a command, but it is deep in our hearts to do this.
  Our life is a life of self-sacrifice, where we are continually meeting the needs of those around us. Each of us that live here are fully devoting ALL of our time, energy, and possessions - everything - to seeing the reality of what is in our Creator's heart come about on the earth.

      <name>Bitternut Homestead Urban Collective</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22390&quot;&gt;Bitternut Homestead Urban Collective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Ecological Social Justice, Permaculture Kitchen Gardening, Community Development Projects, Progressive Political Organizing and Activism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bitternut-collective-on-otisco-st/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bitternut-collective-on-otisco-st/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
The Bitternut Homestead (named after the Native American Iroquois word Otisco, or Us-te-ke, meaning &quot;bitter-nut-hickory&quot;) is a 4 bedroom home in Syracuse's Near West Side (NWS) just off of downtown.  Syracuse is a city of 145,000 people, and the NWS is an urban community with high racial, but low economic, diversity - a median income of $25,653 exists in the bottom 3.5% of national zip codes.

The house at 717 Otisco St is a 100-year old renovated Victorian purchased in 2010 for $1 from Home Headquarters (HHQ), a local quasi-governmental/non-profit housing agency.  The house had been vacant for 3-4 years at the time of purchase, and required new plumbing, electric, heating, hot water, structural repairs from water and animal damage, and major interior and exterior finish work.  For instance, all window glass was broken and would be replaced while preserving the original wooden frames and sills.

Residents of the Homestead live and &quot;act&quot; together, a primary strategy for creating community.  Desired shared chores include cooking, shopping, cleaning, trash/recycling, gardening, and other tasks including a spring and fall cleaning day, and a spring and fall gardening day.  The grounds are landscaped according to Permaculture principles &amp;amp; design, the original owner Frank Cetera being a local Permaculture educator and designer.  The Collective also houses the operations desk/office of The Alchemical Nursery, a non-profit organization working to create &quot;Regenerative Landscapes and Lifestyles&quot; utilizing strategies from the realms of Permaculture, mutual aid, eco-socialism, social justice, &amp;amp; ecovillage philosophies &amp;amp; methodologies; and this year hosted a campaign HQ office for a resident's Green Party run for city council.

Natural building &amp;amp; simple living are also strategies being utilized.  Heating is currently through electric baseboard heating for instance.  Although electric heating is initially more expensive from the supply side, it was chosen because it is less expensive to install, allows zoned control in each room, can be supplied by solar panels in the future, can be secondary/supplementary only when wood burning appliance is installed, and to keep natural gas out of this &quot;Anti-Fracking House&quot;.  Other techniques include interior natural clay plastering and homemade paints, hugelkultur garden beds made from downed woody debris, hand finished floors (scraping, sanding, treating with linseed oil), food fermentation and preservation.

See our Values and Our Commitments to Each Other under &quot;About Us&quot; on our web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ravens-roost-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ravens-roost-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ravens' Roost Cohousing is Anchorage's first and only cohousing neighborhood.  Phase 1 was completed November 2016 and Phase II was completed in March 2018, bringing the total number of units to 35. 

Ravens' Roost housing community includes a large common house with kitchen, dining room, library, kids' play room, laundry room and two guest rooms. On the property are also a well-equipped workshop, Ski and bicycle maintenance stations, sewing/craft room, exercise equipment and gardens on 6.2 acres of land. Large portions of the property include native spruce and birch tree forest area and some open lawn areas. 

The site is conveniently located in southeast Anchorage with easy access to arterial roads and shopping, yet still nestled in the quiet foothills of the Chugach Mountain Range. The property is 1/2 mile from a variety of shopping, services and restaurant options; and within one mile of public elementary, middle and high schools. There are also a number of private and charter schools nearby. Also nearby are world-class Nordic ski, mountain biking and multi-use trail networks, and a paved bike path that connects to other paths throughout Anchorage, an equestrian center and a small Alpine skiing area.

Much of our membership enjoys the many outdoor activities that Alaska has to offer. The community founders are long-time Anchorage residents and more-recent members hail from across the U.S. and the East Coast.

We currently have 32 member households representing all ages and a very diverse collection of professions and backgrounds. Detailed bios are available on our website.  We are actively seeking new members to join us and we welcome inquiries at ravensroostcoho.org.

We currently have two, brand-new, townhouse-style units available for sale and immediate occupancy, plus one additional unit available for re-sale. These are the final opportunities to join the only co-housing development of its kind in Alaska!</description>

      <name>Los Portales</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22392&quot;&gt;Los Portales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; human &amp;amp; spiritual development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/los-portales/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/los-portales/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Los Portales, a place to create consciousness; to learn, grow and care for the human spirit and the planet.

Los Portales is an intentional community that practices innovative ways of life in different areas including organic agriculture, holistic education, deep psychology, empowering and power sharing systems of governance, conflict resolution, natural medicines, art, clean energies, an economy based on sharing, and above all, the empowerment of each individual, continually advancing towards greater sustainability and self-sufficiency.
Founded in Andalucía in 1984 (although born in 1978 in Brussels), the inspiration of the founders was nurtured by Jungian psychology and dreamwork as a way to know and transform our fears and pains into power, and to access our hidden talents.
We have a firm commitment to personal and global development and harmony through respect for oneself, each other and our environment. We conceive the community not as an end in itself, but as a means of creation and a path of transformation. Our mission is constantly evolving to respond to the global need for change at this very special time in the history of humanity.
After 33 years of existence, Los Portales is a well-established, stable and broad project that has developed in many directions and integrated the main dimensions of sustainability.

Ecological
Our ecological consciousness developed gradually, from the inside out, through dreamwork, by listening to our deepest needs and longings and through our connection to our natural environment.
Today we are 75% self-sufficient in food. We organically produce vegetables, seasonal fruit, grains, goat cheese, olive oil, medicinal herbs, spices, herbal teas and remedies, preserves and natural cosmetics. We also use local edible plants in our kitchen. We have taken measures not only to prevent erosion and desertification but also to regenerate the land and landscape (ongoing reforestation, water retention landscape and holistic management projects). We are totally off-grid, and water and power sovereign (we use solar panels, home-made wind turbines and a hydraulic turbine).

Social
The community is a dynamic, diverse and multi-generational group and is organised in a sociocratic structure, which is used for decision-making.
We use dreamwork as well as Process Work, Forum tools, family and systemic constellations, among others, to practice deep democracy, transform relational difficulties and global conflicts.
Each member is responsible for their own inner work and makes a commitment to the community to work on their own conflicts.

Cultural
We have developed our own culture and rituals as ways to celebrate our achievements and nourish our connection with the essence and meaning of our project. We value beauty, art, music, singing, dance, gastronomy, group meditation, as ways to give cohesion to the group.
We believe that the spiritual dimension of the human being does not develop on the basis of adherence to a school, church or belief system, but spirituality comes when our hearts are open, light and available, and when our interpersonal relationships become creative, based in trust, respect and collaboration.

Economic
Our community was founded on a gift economy system; the principle that each contributes according to their possibilities and obtains from the group according to their needs, within a collectively agreed framework. This has developed over time into mixed economy incorporating community enterprises and individual income sources.
We have achieved economic sustainability through producing a large portion of our own food, and creating income streams through our artisanal bread business, hosting workshops, visitors and giving courses.

Holistic
We find inspiration from the foundations of ecology and permaculture and apply them in the social and psychological dimensions of our lives. For example, we value diversity as a way of enriching our human and natural “ecosystem”, and we observe and honour the group as a living system, where each person’s role is valued. We explore the correspondence between the inside and the outside; we try to minimize the waste produced by our activities, starting with our “emotional waste”, which is often the most difficult to recycle, and we learn to support the self-regulating aspects of the group and its collective intelligence.

Building Community In the Wider Environment
We are active in our local environment through our links to the local authorities, schools and universities and a variety of local and regional networks. We also make our knowledge, experiences and practices accessible to the wider community through free regular guided visits, workshops, trainings, visits and retreats, participation in WWOOFING, conferences, and our temporary membership scheme.
There is an urban extension of Los Portales in Madrid, Crealliance whose aim is to promote the creation of alliances between different areas of expertise and to build bridges between people from different backgrounds through sharing information, training and networking.</description>

 We live together, not as individuals merely cohabitating, but as an extended family, supporting and loving one other.
 The community extends beyond our house into the neighborhood at-large. There are many people who spend many hours here, but live at other addresses close by.
 Our community includes artists, environmentalists, musicians, educators, social workers, advocates, and students.
 We often take group trips to concerts, art shows, hiking, and other such outings. We cook and brew beer, garden and dance, play music and make art, travel and read together.
 We have potlucks every Sunday evening, and we welcome visitors to this weekly feast!</description>

We desire to live in a net zero energy community where geothermal and solar energy replace all fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ralston-creek-cohousers/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ralston-creek-cohousers/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Ralston Creek CoHousers have chosen Geos as the ideal partner for an exciting cohousing project that fuses the best of intentional neighborhoods, healthy living, and green technology.  Cohousing choices range from studios to 2 bedroom condominiums in a 3 story, mixed use building with a common house.

We are meeting now to develop our vision, grow our community, and plan our space. Groundbreaking has begun on townhomes and single family homes in the Geos development.  (http://www.discovergeos.com).

The developer and the location within Geos for cohousing has been determined.  Geos is slated to be a net zero energy community containing around 250 residences in Arvada, Colorado.  The Geos neighborhood already has 8 completed units, where the modern, clean architecture pairs with state of the art solar, geothermal and air exchange.  Superior craftsmanship and tight standards regarding heating/cooling loss make these homes comfortable and cozy.       

With easy access to the Ralston Creek bike path, and overlooking open space suitable for a community garden, the planned “Gatehouse” cohousing building will be 3 stories (elevators) above a parking garage with 20 or fewer individual units and a common area suitable for shared meals and activities.  A shared outdoor courtyard will encourage gatherings.

Old Town Arvada (also along the bike path) has a light rail station with free parking, a summer Farmer’s Market and local independent shops and restaurants.  Within a few miles, art, music, dance, theater and classes for all ages are all housed in the Arvada Center and multiple recreation centers cover all aspects of sport, fitness and aquatic classes and drop-in opportunities.  Multiple grocery stores, restaurants, banks and big box stores are also close by.   

Six families have committed to building this unique intentional community and we are seeking others to move the project forward to an architectural design stage.  The current core group has attended national and regional cohousing seminars, networks with other communities and have hired a cohousing consultant and web designer to make our dream a reality.
 
With a core group of 12 or more families, decision making can begin on all aspects of community building and the projected timeline of 2 years to move-in will begin.

Cost is projected to be $300 per square foot and commitment includes financial obligations as well as participation in all aspects of planning and implementation.</description>

Our group of 7 adults (6 members and one non-member resident) strive to be the best stewards of the 140 acres of forest we call home. We operate a collective homestead and market garden, employing the principles of permaculture. We place a heavy emphasis of self-sufficiency, producing the bulk of our own food supply (vegetables, meat, dairy). During the growing season, when time allows, we retail our products at market to offset our operating costs. We also carry on a regenerative forestry program, supplying us with fuel wood and timber for milling. Our community is off the grid, with some solar for our minimal electricity needs. We are currently offering 10 shares (4 remain) in our enterprise. Shares entitle each member to a home site and collective ownership of farm and forest. Our intention is to gather a group of like-minded folks, with complimentary skills together in an &quot;extended family&quot; situation of interdependence, to work within the larger community around us, creating and fostering a more ecologically responsible way of living on our land.</description>

Rancho &amp;#8734; Amigos is strategically located approximately 100kms from Puerto Vallarta and Careyes, on one of the largest fresh water lakes in Mexico! We are a self-sustainable eco-ranch located on 300 hectares (approx. 750 acres) on Cajon de Peñas in the Tomatlan region in Jalisco Mexico. Each home is built using the best available materials to ensure maximum lifetime.

The ranch features hundreds of fruit trees and homes are located in very close proximity to the river. We are building a strong community of individuals and families who can be completely self-sustainable and live in harmony with nature. We have livestock on the ranch, water from nearby mountain springs (all plumbing is in place), hundreds of fruit trees, and not to mention each home will have it's own 100 square meter vegetable garden / greenhouse on very fertile soil.

Come see what we're all about and for more information about how to become a part of our project.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22402&quot;&gt;Community Refuge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To live sustainably&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/community-refuge/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/community-refuge/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The land and house are ready to be occupied. The vision is to provide a place to live in a simple and eco-friendly way and also use the land for the purpose of spiritual growth, healing and education.

 One of the more important aspects in order to live together as a community is to be able to communicate, have a healthy sense of self and understand and agree to pitch in when needed to make it work. Many hands make light work. Character traits that need to be cultivated to make this work are integrity and honesty, understanding unconditional love, humbleness, kindness, willingness to work with others, ability to see the vision and problem solve, work towards a common goal, encourager.

The physical property does not have zoning restrictions, so alternative housing, camping, rv's and trailers are not a problem.

There is a small, spring fed stocked pond, woods, streams, ravines, open pastures, friendly neighbors. So far, it just the house (5 bedroom) and some fencing in place. 

The house does have a mortgage and utilities have to be paid until alternatives are found/built, so there needs to be some sort of income so that the bills are paid. I need a minimum of five people who are willing to put in a monthly amount of $250.00 ea to get it going. As businesses are established that will diminish.

The property is located within a 30 minute drive to Chillicothe, Lancaster, Circleville, Logan, Ohio and about 50 - 60 minutes from Columbus, Ohio and surrounding suburbs.

One of the things we want to accomplish is to have some kind of outreach or service to the extended community in the area. Most of our outreach has to do with encouraging others to live in a sustainable manner.

There are a lot of things that can be shared living the community lifestyle.
Our &quot;stuff&quot;, encouragement, support, work, food, accomplishments and the list goes on. 

Those interested in becoming a part of this community need to be ready to spend time communicating through email and phone calls. If you send an email that just says &quot;Hi, can I come and visit&quot; or &quot;What can I get from this community&quot; without any other input, you may want to try someplace else. 

Tell us a little about yourself, what are your goals, dreams and visions, what can you bring to help build this community, why does this community appeal to you, what you are willing to commit to.

Have you ever felt drawn to something different than the status quo? Does the American dream not quite ring true for you? Do you dream of a community of peaceful Christ followers that live simply, do good, and love others without all the dogma and legalism? Are you passionate about Jesus and want desperately to find a group of believers who want to return to the love and passion of the early church but don't feel comfortable with the denominations you've been a part of? Maybe it's time for something new. I personally have an undying passion for Christ and his church, but I find that every time I'm &quot;church&quot; I feel like I’m watching a production, and once I'm away from the noise and the lights and music, I feel emptier than ever... my vision is an intentional community of believers that strives to reflect the early church. I’m not quite sure what it will look like, but here are a few ideas.
•	Co-housing and daily communal prayer and worship. Shared chores and at least one meal daily. 
•	Ministering to the community in areas of homelessness, social work, maybe eventually a food pantry. 
•	various outreaches
•	sustainability and ecological stewardship
•	A diverse, multicultural, group of Jesus lovers from all walks of life! 

There have been a few to attempt what I’m dreaming up, but before you write it off as another cult, look up Jesus people and the simple way, some others have the same idea and are doing it right! Together we can make this happen!
If you like what you’ve read and want to start a dialogue email me at machaseh@yahoo.com (it’s Hebrew for refuge ^_^)

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22405&quot;&gt;A Growing Playce To Practice Collaborative Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to encourage, guide, and give field experience to efforts in collaboration that helps to create social, environmental, and financial sustainability (often via alternative economies), with continual efforts to be inclusive and diversified. We live intentionally to care for each other and the environment and over the years to acquire housing in close proximity to one another with common spaces for community activities. We are committed to learn how to be a community that identifies itself as a &quot;natural support&quot; for a sustainable number of marginalized individuals who live in the community (and more outside the physical community) by engaging them in programs of social agriculture (or care farming), creative self-expression through the arts, micro-enterprises in the arts, urban farming and marketing, and the hospitality aspects of operating a retreat center that provides residencies to artists and activists who come to develop their work in collaboration with a person who has a psychiatric label or is disenfranchised from society though such label. The artists' only obligation for this no cost residency is to include a mentally disturbed resident in need of community recognition and engagement in some phases of the development of their art or performance. We hope to support one another as residents seeking permanent community in comfortable safe housing areas that include some of society's most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/a-growing-playce-for-practice-in-human-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/a-growing-playce-for-practice-in-human-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Presently we have many features of an established intentional community and are working toward sustainability around growing food, raising chickens and bees, and supporting both residents and non-residents with emotional challenges to express themselves and heal through the arts. We also have a therapeutic miniature horse, and engage people in social agriculture or &quot;care farming,&quot; in which a mini-farm is used to create and maintain community with disenfranchised individuals. We hold meetings and a &quot;creative movement group&quot; in New Orleans with occasional extended retreat weekends in Bay Saint Louis designed to help us develop consensus skills, practice collaboration, identify our common values, objectives and covenants, and to establish our bylaws. We are presently four Bay Saint Louis residents and four non-residential members in New Orleans. Some of us wish to own our own homes, while others wish to remain renters; there is a plethora of housing stock either contiguous to the Bay Saint Louis properties, located in &quot;Old Town,&quot; or within short walking distance of it. We would like to acquire adjacent properties in the neighborhood. Two residents live in a self-contained house with a studio apartment in the rear for another resident, who is also the farm manager. The house next door is reserved for &quot;retreats&quot; in which artists come either in groups or individually to do their own creative work and to share it with a person with mental challenges to engage that person's in self expression.  In the future, we hope for shared office space, personnel and a performance venue where micro businesses, social entrepreneurships, or cooperative businesses will emerge.

People who live in the community must be open to inclusion of people from all races and backgrounds, and over time, they must be willing to include and offer natural support to a few individuals who have special life challenges or have been marginalized. Presently a cooperative is forming within this community among people who are using the arts and a Buddhist model for &quot;being present&quot; with people who are experiencing what is called &quot;psychosis&quot; in the medical system. The aim of the cooperative is to offer an a more compassionate form of healing or a place of sanctuary from the brutality associated with undergoing conventional &quot;treatment.&quot;  At this time, this group is called &quot;The BeWith Community,&quot; and it is also the model used by artists in residence working with those who have psychological maladies. 

Objectives: We need people who can buy or rent residences so we can create a nearly contiguous pattern of properties that will make community life viable in a small urban setting. But anyone is welcome to apply who wishes to participate in building a community where a variety of micro-businesses or social entrepreneurships will emerge in urban farming, renovation and building with salvaged materials, social agriculture, holistic mental health, and the operation of a well-needed retreat center for urban artists (New Orleans artists will have first consideration), designed to host workshops in performing arts, healing retreats, InterPlay events (www.interPlay.org), and other convergences in the arts for social change. 

Social agriculture” (care famring) is one such entrepreneurship that will quickly grow to a business in the larger community, but a pre-vocational training program in the gardens is already in use on the community grounds to engage adults and children from the outside community in caring for plants and animals while they acquire a sense of belonging, purpose, and interdependence of all life on earth. Right now there are only four of us in the social garden space, which is used also for gatherings--for “play” or social purposes that build community. Social agriculture is inclusive, creative, and playful. It offers alternative activities for healing mind and body. We grow food. We grow community. We grow well. 

Come home to A Playce that creates its sustainability through interdependence, artistic expression, and commitment to belonging and purpose for everybody.</description>

Plenitude Ecovillage goal is to establish a community with a foundation or mantra found in the book 'Plenitude' by Juliet Schor.  A community that will build social capital, become and teach self-reliance and balance work and life. Sustainability is the core value as with most ecovillages but also a desire to build alliances with the community outside Plenitude.  The area currently to establish the Ecovillage as a sub community within the Ecovillage Dancing Rabbit.

Establishing an internal and external economy focusing on 'green' economy skills and tradesman skills.
The population goal is 50 permanent villagers with additional interns and visitors calling Plenitude and Dancing Rabbit home.
If interested in building a home, life and community contact us or Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage to begin the adventure. 
We wish to start having meetings once a month to share information and share with other like-minded individuals.

Greetings Future Communards!

We are a group of Libertarian Socialists, on a mission to create an Educational, Intentional Community Enterprise that's grounded in Naturalism, Egalitarianism and Environmentalism.  

By embracing Anarchist Communism, Sociocracy, Secular Humanist ethics, interpersonal and ecological intimacy, education, art, science and technology, we will create an high-tech environment that delivers optimal individual freedom and happiness, a strong and cohesive community, comprehensive sustainable self-sufficiency and regional ecological sustainability. And, we will do all of this, while living out our lives in an evolving therapeutic environment of our own creation.

Our Therapeutic Ecovillage will consist of at least 4 parts. Each component will serve three basic functions: 1) provide for the direct needs of the community  2) deliver revenue from outside sources 3) serve marginalized populations.

1)Walden Ecoversity: an education, research and training center that develops academic, technological and vocational programming , products and services that relate to rational, sustainable living.

2) Walden Farm: All community lands and natural resources constitute the farm. 
a) It will provide year-round organic sustenance for residents &amp;amp; guests.
b) Functions as the hands-on training facility for the Wellness Resort's Right Living curriculum.
c) It is the laboratory for the agricultural college.

3) Walden Wellness Resort featuring: ABA, REBT, Secular Humanism, Permaculture &amp;amp; various non-mystical Eastern practices.
a)Hotel
b)Restaurant
c)Spa (yoga, meditation, massage, exercise, Dietitian, personal services)
d)Recreational facilities.

4)Ancillary businesses will be developed from mission-related factors, community need and the skills that members bring to the enterprise.

Our Therapeutic Ecovillage Community Enterprise will:
1) provide 'Quality of All Life' research, training, support and social entrepreneurial functions.
2) demonstrate the exceptional lifestyle &amp;amp; individual happiness that's derived from living rationality, communally &amp;amp; ethically.
3) grow, disseminate and replicate.
 
This overview is VERY superficial; please check out our website: http://www.waldenecovillage.info/ for a comprehensive description of our project.

Zephyr Creek Crossing is a three/four family community located in central Kentucky in a beautiful, semi-rural area on a year-round state highway halfway between Richmond (home of EKU) and Berea (home of Berea College) Kentucky approx ten miles off I-75, 40 miles south of Lexington - close enough to commute to work and shopping but still out in the country. (Our nearest neighbors are about a city block away). 

Andy and Sue B purchased a cute country cabin on five acres in 2008 with an interest in creating an intentional community in their retirement.  Two additional living spaces were added and are now occupied and one more is in process. Communal areas include a shared laundry room, workroom/storage area and organic gardens. 

The community arrangement is loose and we function under a rental agreement.  Rules are minimal - common sense and consensual.  We meet together occasionally for meals but chat daily over coffee or tasking. Opportunity exists to co-own with $$ and/or sweat equity, however, ZCC is presently more of a chance to experiment in intentional living before having to make a huge commitment - but the possibility exists. 

Fees equal approx $575-600 a month, plus residents are asked to put in a min. 4 hours per month into the development of the community. WIFI is included but cell phones don't come in well so a land line is shared. 

Our long-term community goals include self-sufficiency, working together for the common good plus becoming more socially and environmentally conscious. Residents should have a regular income source and your own transportation (we occasionally share trips - but there is no public transportation).     

Our organic gardens now contain strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and goji berries, a small fruit orchard and large vegetable gardens. Chickens provide eggs and occasional meat to residents plus we also sell eggs and use their manure in the gardens. 

Occasionally we do have vacancies - if you are interested - contact Sue Peterson Blyth at sweetsue49 @gmail.com or call 859 328 3805.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22412&quot;&gt;Long Haul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We aspire to live simple and healthy lives in a family oriented community setting. Our goal is to reconnect to our means of existence by meeting our needs with land based local economy. We also focus on getting along and character development. We hope to re-cultivate a more meaningful existence for our children than is offered by modern society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/long-haul/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/long-haul/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are currently in search of a live in nanny/au pair (female preferred) especially for the winter months (November-April). Duties would include about 3 hours of babysitting per day, maybe some help with homeschooling and possibly some other help around the house (cooking, cleaning etc). We’re looking for someone who will be actively engaged with our children while watching them and someone who enjoys both indoor and outdoor activities (including lots of playing in the snow even when its cold out). Depending on qualifications and length of stay, in addition to room and board, we may be able to offer a modest stipend which could be negotiable.
We can host visitors from May-October for general homestead infrastructure work including, gardening, building, firewood etc.

We’re a young family of 5 + 1 friend + 1 family of 3 with 60 acres of forest land surrounded by thousands of acres of wilderness. We've cleared an acre or two and we're in the process of designing our future permaculture food forest/orchard. So far we've planted over 20 young fruit trees as well as raspberries, blueberries and strawberries among other things. We'll be planting a lot of perennials this year.  We just completed a 7ftx12ft seed starting greenhouse addition off our house and we have a 13ftx20ft hoophouse. We grow most of our annuals in cedar raised beds we milled and built. We're surrounded by mature maple and mixed boreal forest which is primarily public land.  WE DO NOT HAVE A WELL YET (no running water).  There's a spring near the center of the property and we catch rainwater off our roof.  We're 5 miles as the crow flies from the North Shore of Lake Superior and less than a mile from three small lakes. There are many hiking trails close by including the Superior Hiking Trail. We're 20 miles south of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Some of what we currently do includes building using mostly natural and salvaged materials, log building, permaculture based gardening and planting, clearing land, cutting and chipping wood, making trails, maple syruping and wild ricing, and some hunting and fishing. We're 7 miles from town on a good dirt road and then 2 miles up an old rutted logging road only passable with 4×4 vehicles, hence the “Long Haul”. We mostly use a snowmobile for winter access up the 2 mile road which is not plowed or maintained. We eventually plan on doing some road improvement once we have the resources. We have a work party every fall. We're off the grid with wi-fi internet through cell phone towers and solar electricity. We cook and heat with wood. We're happy to host visitors who are self reliant and able to get their basic needs met in a primitive camp setting. We also have opportunities for work trade internships with meals and lodging provided. We have a tiny insulated guest cabin with a woodstove. We are interested in the possibility of doing a land share and setting up a non-profit co-ownership structure if the right folks came along. The land is paid for and we never ask for money from any visitors. We are open to visitors for any length of stay or level of commitment. Our long term vision is to share the land with 2-8 other households with similar interests. Please check our other websites for more info. Feel free to contact us with any questions and thanks for your interest.

We are 13 persons--couples and singles-- who share a common life and ministry in a large house in the Irvington neighborhood of Portland, Oregon.  Sharing includes income, possessions, time, affection and a Christian faith that is ecumenical, open and inclusive.  Ministries include (a) community building, (b)peacemaking through personal witness and non-violent action, (c)hospitality, including a free weekly meal for low income, homeless people and (at times) free on site hospice care for persons who are dying, and (d)support for persons who are grieving because of personal loss and/or the disintegration of the social order.

Every morning we gather for community prayer and Bible study, and every evening we share a common meal.  Visitors are encouraged to join us for these activities, although in the case of supper we ask people to call us ahead of time.

In 2011 we celebrated our 25th anniversary.  Four of the original founding members of the household are still here after these many years.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22414&quot;&gt;Pilot House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Sustainable Living Practices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/pilot-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/pilot-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Pilot House presents opportunities to explore and develop an intentional, residential co-op styled, eco-community model. This project involves completing a remodeling design for an 1890s era three story house with four rooms suitable as individual personal spaces, one and three quarter baths, along with common areas including a kitchen, a family room, a living room, a small utility room, and full basement.

Project funding is provided by participants in the community, whether subscribing contributors to the model, shorter term guests, monthly renters, or simply floor campers just passing through. Applying stewardship to this old house rewards participants with direct returns on investments. 

Anyone interested in visiting is welcome anytime. Shorter term living arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Settling in for a month or so to check out this prospect will involve helping out with the cash flow plus doing some basic work assignments of about 40 hours per month.

A basic premise for Pilot House is that Intentional Community is a personal adventure that explores real frontiers of human social experience and that Community must therefore be intentionally accomplished. An open conversation policy provides our basis for organizing community processes, addressing individual interests, evaluating progress, and meeting any challenges in our cooperative living arrangements.

There are no philosophical or devotional practices required of residents of the community, only honest respect for any adopted by others, and agreement that personal practices will not impose on other member's lifestyles or liberties.

As the community aspect of this project develops, mutual benefits of shared equity practices and property held in common in the co-op model will be gained. Continuing household members will determine their equitable co-ownership positions in it through their contributions to the project.

Please accept this invitation, if you like, to help explore a work in progress, and further chart its course.

Below was the old intro related to the project. Currently  (Oct2018) we're on hold trying to reshape the idea and launch another initiative in the near future.

Hello world

We are launching a dream starting-up a group to develop a Costa Rican Eco-Community of devoted nature lovers. We do not have a membership guideline yet since the idea emerge just a few weeks ago but there is already some people showing interest to join. The crucial goal is to use all the knowledge, experience, skills and resources of the community members to create a sustainable living environment with comfortable but environmental friendly home standards.

Aldea 506 Ecovillage will be a project focused on preserve for ever a beautiful rainforest property but also will include some areas for the development of a self sustainable community with a certain number of members sharing a permanent or temporary residence space and a new model of life with full respect for the rich biodiversity of this Costa Rican paradise. The property is located in San Carlos, north of the country and already includes a 49 hectares (120 acres) of primary forest, river and facilities such as an acceptable road access electricity and potable water, but we could also consider some plans to adjoin more land in the future for additional purposes or new projects.  Additionally to the main idea could be also very interesting for the mid term phases encourage the project as a permaculture model and/or experiencing with organic production. While the supply of electric energy and water is already available we also like to explore alternatives such as rainwater harvesting and wind/solar as clean energy. The property is also positive located in an area rated with the lowest level of disasters impact recently updated by the CNE (Government Emergency Authority) where there is not mayor danger of earthquakes, flooding, tornados or hurricanes. 

Other important added value for the members of Aldea 506 will be the opportunity to share a living place among others with similar vision and philosophy building deep and strong friendship relationships were respect and principles will be the foundation of this inner culture. At this moment we are pointing out our expectations to find a member profile passionate by culture, arts, eager to learn and share knowledge, willing to help each other but also as mentioned above a nature lover person who clearly understand that we must do all possible to preserve the earth for the future.

As of now and while we continue working to shape in detail how the profile of the project will be, please feel free to contact us with any question you may have.

An ecovillage community is forming in an area east of Dallas. We will locate in a rural area within reasonable commuting distance to Dallas-Fort Worth--probably in Hunt County. Our main purposes are community and sustainable living.

We grow all or most of our own food--always all organic--no chemicals are used on this property. 

We will share some buildings, optional meals, some tools, and live as a helpful community. 

Homes: Our homes are affordable, super energy efficient, zero-energy with solar electricity, solar hot water, and rainwater harvesting. Members own their own home and we do not share income. 

We will build from compresses earth blocks (adobe). We have had the earth in this area tested for strength. This means that much building can be DIY if that is your choice.


The ecovillage is laid out following Permaculture principles and practices.

Water: Our water is secure. We have diverse water in an area with 40&quot; average annual rainfall: Rainwater harvesting, well(s) from a clean aquifer, pond(s), swales, and other Permacultue Earthworks

There are several nearby large reserviors for recreation. 

Community: This is a community with diversity of ages, races, and religions.

Farming: We farm organically via Permaculture zones, community gardens, private gardens, and food forests.

Land: We have the finances to buy land now and will buy land in 2013 in order to start working the land. Building in 2013 is not required, though.

Learning and Training: We have had, and will continue to have, classes and hands-on experience in topics such as organic farming, growing fruits and vegetables, food forests, earthworks, green building, Permaculture, solar hot water, solar electricity, building with compressed earth blocks, rain water harvesting, off-the-grid living, and many homesteading skills.

Motropolis is a means to craft and foster an inclusive culture of Humanistic endeavor by forging bonds with individuals though multiple experiences, events and gatherings. To open and direct discussion towards what steps are best to take now, in order to pursue and facilitate each individuals' personal quests, passions, dreams, goals and endeavors though the sustaining and development of the whole of our community.

Every one, has a unique and indefinable Reality that comes from the entirety of every one's multitude of experiences and perspective that constitute a entirely unique way of life. By recognizing that fundamental aspect in every individual, we can see that every one has many things offer outside of the traditional resume or job experience and therefore can collaborate as bonded individuals interdependently rather than just work for some one, in order to create new endeavors or address current issues. So that we may develop and propagate a connected and inclusive culture of self-fulfillment and self-investment through community action, sustainable living, propagation of knowledge and insight to develop the Humanistic imperative

Is part of our vision working with all principles of permaculture, agroforestry, bioconstruction, conscious consumption, social tools as forum and non-violent communication, local economy with our own currency, empowerment and consense, libertary education, deep ecology, alltogether in a relaxed and harmonious social environment. 

We have no leaders or spiritual guides. In these way we care about a more horizontal and human scale commmunity, open to diversity and conflict, as part of life. Not contradicting that, there is leadership in some way, as everyone is good in something. And we do make rituals and spiritual celebrations, aiming to connect with nature/cosmos, with others and with oneself, but without dogmas.

At the moment we work all in the community, sharing food, infrastructure and a good time togheter. The economy is partially shared, that mean that part of the income goes to the community, for food and materials, and part goes for the individuals, as they work there. Still our main income is through workshops, visitors and sells, but we aim to diversify more the economic projects, both for community and individuals.

The community area is divided in comunal area and &quot;private&quot; area, that mean, each member of the association can buy and have a piece of land to build house, grow food and have private life, according to our vision and principles. But the owner is the association. 

We offer courses and accept visitors and volunteers. See in our website www.arcaverde.org

People are like fingers of a hand, who work together to accomplish great things. Earth Tribe’s purpose is to remind people how to thrive with each other.

Healthy Individual, Healthy Community, Healthy Planet!
 

We can live cooperatively with Earth and each other.

We can live peacefully, happily, full of vitality, wonder, freedom, and fun.

Let us create and share a way of life which is enriching, exciting, and sustainable!

We’re Building a Community of Our Dreams…

A group of good friends are looking for farming and community land in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, etc. Generally somewhere remote in the mid-atlantic area, with mountains, great water sources, plenty of forest, and luscious soil that receives solid sunshine!

Organic food cultivation will be integral. Energy will also be harvested from nature in non invasive ways. Sustainability and self-sufficiency will be cornerstone values to the pursuit.

There will be a school integrated into the community so that there is continuing education available for all ages in an unlimited variety of fields based on the input and interests of the members of the community, who teach most of the classes, along with visiting teachers.

The school also helps by hosting retreats, as well as classes offered for work/trade or paying visitors, and guests from other communities. A form of barter through knowledge and teaching, which continues to enrich, nourish, strengthen and renew the tribe.

It starts with a core group and the right opportunity. There are at least a hand or two of us who all know each other very well and who want to do this together, plus many others who could be called upon in order to embolden and expand on projects when they are ready. We are willing to live on your farm or land through an agreement to help you turn it into a community, if we share a similar vision.

Connect to Earth Tribe!

If you would like to connect to our project, to offer any ideas, assistance, or advice, please message below or email Connect@Earth-Tribe.org. You can also hear from us and reach us on Facebook! Thank you!

NOTE: We do not yet have land, please do not email about a place to stay or to rent, because there is not one yet. This is a dream that we are working towards putting in place by around 2020.

      <name>Heart-Culture Farm Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22425&quot;&gt;Heart-Culture Farm Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Cooperative Childraising, Sustainable Food Production&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/heart-culture-farm-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/heart-culture-farm-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
Located on an historical 1890's homestead on the West edge of the city of Eugene, Oregon, Heart-Culture Farm Community is committed to experiments in sustainability. Our setting, on the edge of the Fern Ridge Wetlands Wildlife Preserve, lends unique opportunities and challenges, as we work to listen to the land, encourage rare wetlands species to thrive, and learn to steward our livestock in a way that increases the health of our local ecosystems.  

Much of our food is grown on-site, including fruits, vegetables, milk, eggs, and meats.  Some long-term residents are experienced in traditional farm skills, including butchering and wildcrafting.  We pasture our livestock and feed them organic and non-GMO as much as possible.  Weston Price and traditional diet life-ways are an inspiration.  

Heart-Culture is a family-oriented community, with primarily home-schooled children.  The Continuum Concept, Attachment Parenting, Hand in Hand Parenting, and Waldorf have all influenced our community parenting style.  Most babies and toddlers are raised diaper free (Elimination Communication), with extended breastfeeding and cooperative parenting as the norm.

We recognize the importance of both ecological and interpersonal sustainability.  We are committed to personal and interpersonal growth.  Each individual is responsible for their own growth path, with some group activities.  Participation in mediation processes is mandatory.  Our members' growth paths range from Re-Evaluation Co-Counseling, to Shamanism, to Polyamory.  Everyone has personal challenges, and that's fine as long as we keep it moving.  Emotional growth is key to sustainable communities, and living in community is, in itself, a part of our growth path.

All forms of loving relationships are welcome at Heart-Culture.  Monogamy, Polyamory, hetero- and homo-sexuality, and celibacy are all potentially loving lifestyle/relationship options.  We recognize the value of fluid relationship forms, and strive to make choices from our true selves instead of being confined to society's boxes.  Some of our members are married and monogamous (both hetero- and homosexual); some are single parents, others have polyamorous relationships.  Whatever we choose, we remain aware of the family-oriented nature of our community.</description>

The Metahive Project(MP) will be a partnership with people and organizations whose common wish is to build &quot;Kins Domain&quot;/ecovillage/holistic Healing centre, and alternative living space in harmony with each other and nature. We have registered with &quot;Start Some Good&quot; (startsomegood.com) a &quot;Peer Funding&quot; site and in February will start a campaign to raise Start up costs and then continue to raise operations and to buy our land.
If you have land in BC or any where else in Canada we wish you could donate it to the project. Please contact me via email.

Our wish to be located in the Okanagan region in BC, Canada. We wish to find any area of land suitable and good people to help make the project a reality. 

If you have land or know someone who is wishing to donate a few acres or would like to be a part of the project or can help in anyway please email me. 

Through the FB page we wish to nurture an online community and create connectivity to share ideas, experiences, knowledge and wisdom with all those who share our common, goals, values and beliefs.

In our world there is an awakening to a new paradigm shift that we need to work with understanding, love, and harmony &amp;amp; with one another to solve all our challenges. There is a shift in conciseness happening all over the world and People are awakening
to realize that old “society” and ideals of
“Fear and Consumption” have to change now. Please come be a part of the Metahive Project.

      <name>CampOma Rural &amp; Pumpkin Spice Urban EcoVillage</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22427&quot;&gt;CampOma Rural &amp; Pumpkin Spice Urban EcoVillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; enviro-spiritual, healing camp.
My vision for the land:

A place where families and individuals contribute to a community of acceptance, love, joy, and a place for meaningful work. A place where individual's visions can become reality – so long as it melds with the the existing group and their parameters of being environmentally sound.  A healing, smoke and drug free environment.  Self sustaining, off the grid, able to grow most of our own food using a permaculture model. A strong commitment from members to deal with one's emotional stuff and a willingness to learn how to communicate compassionately and be respectful to everyone.  
This is a healing center for the community, our guests, and the land. We aim to have a retreat in the woods with tree houses, cob, cord wood, strawbale and all sorts of fun eco-structures (ie. boat beds in the air, hammock camping, hobbit holes etc! - your imagination is the limit). A campground for individuals of all ages and families to learn about the natural environment and gain skills they can use elsewhere. An outdoor school program. Eco-businesses such as furniture making from the 100 acres of maple trees, natural building workshops, Llama packing, wilderness survival, mushroom growing for entrepreneurial souls are but a few ideas to generate our own economic security. Everyone will contribute what they can in time, talent, and treasure (perhaps 50% income sharing?). Work as little as possible for the money economy on the outside world and incorporate a fair trade system, including exchange for our services like food, helping build each other's housing, retreats, and workshops. Generate enough capital from business off the land to sustain ourselves and be debt and mortgage free. Yeah! We will serve as good stewards of the land to rejuvenate the previously clear cut forest and rehabilitate the creek. We intend to have a permaculture garden and food forest, and recruit interns to teach gardening and natural building to. 
 We want to extend ourselves beyond our boundaries to share our skills and tools with neighbors and visitors.  We aim to establish eco-village zoning to be able to grow beyond 20 members to approximately 120 -130 members eventually. We will serve as a world-wide model of a new operating system which meets our social, economic and basic human needs without oppressing others, with cooperation rather than competition, which is life affirming as the fullest expression of what it is to be a self actualized human able to joyously care for each other, our neighbors and our environment!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/campoma/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/campoma/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We have a city &amp;amp; rural community within the Portland area. Eagle Creek, just 25 miles outside of beautiful Portland, Oregon, is situated in the foothills of Mt. Hood on 120 acres, and is the home of a rustic, newly forming enviro-spiritual, healing, permaculture community and are hoping to start an Outdoor School program. In Portland we have a 4 bedroom house on 1/4 of an acre with 2 chickens currently and we are installing a geothermal greenhouse. Ideally, we are looking for 10 -15 pioneering individuals or couples to put energy into creating this community.  We hope to be able to serve those who need a city connection at times and those who want to be more off-grid. The land is paid for already, so that is not a hurdle; however, everything else: road in, the buildings, water, energy sources, monetary resources etc. still needs to be created. I plan to build a home and put in some infrastructure in 2019. If you like to start with a completely open slate and create from scratch, then this community is for you! Open to all sorts of ideas provided they fit within the realm of being environmentally sound and are suitable to forestland. Consider furniture making, building treehouses and natural buildings, setting up a camp for kids and adults to learn about nature and survival skills, hosting healing retreats, doing llama packing, spinning your own wool etc.  Really the possibilities are as large as your imagination. You must be emotionally mature and ready to learn, expand and stretch beyond your comfort zone to make a healthy community and create a true space of love.
We plan to start small with 10 - 15 members and who knows if eco-village zoning becomes a legal zone to grow from there. THIS IS A DRUG AND SMOKE FREE COMMUNITY (including marijuana and limited to preferably no alcohol). That's the main liberation! Please submit your ideas and the gifts you bring for consideration as a founding member of this community to FionaRhea.  If you're local to Portland, come join us up on the land most of the summer as we work on various projects. I recommend reading Creating a Life Together and the Ringing Cedar series for insights into building community. Come see what we're up to and see if you'd like to put some roots down and start a project of your own!

Candelaria Madidi Ecológico is a community created
with the purpose of implementing ecological projects that will aid in the conservation of a 35,000 hectare territory adjacent to the most critical part of Madidi National Park. The organization is composed mainly of native people from all over Bolivia that share the interest of protecting this region through innovative eco-projects. This area  is one of the most critical in the Amazon region since it's one of the last  biological corridors between the Andean foothills and the Amazon plains has not been interrupted by human presence. Ironical to the enormous size of Madidi National Park, this most critical region is the least protected, being so by a thin bottleneck only fourteen kilometres wide. Candelaria Madidi is the terrain adjacent to this bottleneck and the protection of this area is of great importance. For this reason Candelaria Madidi Ecologico has been fighting to establish this area as a community owned protected area and we are now begin projects that will create funds that will allow real conservation and protection efforts to be continuously carried out.

Community status: 

Ecotoursim project: A 1,000,000 dollar ecotourism project has been designed and is currently being presented to grant institutions. 

Healing center and center for universal knowledge project: A project that involves creating a unified global and ancient knowledge center, a universal wisdom school, a universal healing center. This project is in the design phase.

Ecovillage status: We are looking for people interested in being part of our community. We are currently designing a community layout and are offering different ways to include new members. check the page http://altomadidiproject.blogspot.com/p/community.html -english under construction, check the spanish page http://altomadidi.blogspot.com/p/comunidad.html-to see in which ways you can join this community. 

VOLUNTEERS: We certainly need help from people interested in HELPING this project and the community happen. We welcome people with proposals on how they could help.

We have broken ground, and we have architectural plans for all of our homes. The first homes are scheduled for occupancy in the fall of 2017. Our development, called Prairie Hill, is located on bus lines about a mile from the University of Iowa and downtown Iowa City. There are numerous restaurants and businesses within easy walking distance of the community. Our common house will include four apartments for sale, and the community will be a mix of single-story townhouses, two-story duplexes and fourplexes, or stacked flats, with two units up and two down. Nearly four acres of our site has been reserved for gardens and orchards where some of our food will be grown, prairie, and open space.

Committed to being a diverse, inclusive, multigenerational community, we are especially interested in attracting families with school-age children. Iowa City Cohousing has been awarded grants and state tax credits to build some affordable workforce homes. We also have grants to provide down-payment assistance for a few homes for income-qualified households. Current members have skills in design, housing finance, green building, landscape architecture, mediation, marketing, electrical engineering, healing arts and more. Many of our members are or have been teachers.

Living sustainably for Prairie Hill Cohousing means building LEED-certifiable homes situated to utilize solar energy, practicing permaculture land-use principles, maintaining storm water on our site, sharing resources from table saws to pet-sitting, and relying on alternative transportation. We have received grants and low-cost loans to support our on-site sustainable stormwater management practices.  

Iowa City ranks high in many national ratings of desirable communities, including 2nd best place to live in America, according to the 2017 Livability.com index. It has top-ranked public schools, a world-class university hospital and a VA hospital, a thriving arts and entertainment culture, and Big Ten sports. It is the only UNESCO City of Literature in the United States. The Iowa City unemployment rate is just 2.3 percent, and it remained low during the recent recession. Iowa City and the University of Iowa have silver ratings as a bicycle-friendly community and university, respectively, by the League of American Bicyclists.</description>

Earthworks Eco Village Design Services

Earthworks Eco Villages is a professional incubation and design service providing project planning, design and development for intentional communities through a development system that integrates the social, ecological and economic needs of the community. We have designed wide variety of intentional communities over the last 30 years.

We dream of living in a world created by conscious decisions that will lead us to a point where the human footprint has a positive impact and actually restores natural systems. If you have ever wanted to be part of a community that is doing it the right way and dealing with our social, economic and environmental issues in an enlightened manner then you might want to explore the Earthworks Eco Village project.

A vision behind Earthworks integrates the best practices for sustainable and healthy living. By making eco enterprise development, eco education and natural health a central focus, Earthworks also hopes to sow the healthy seeds for many more sustainable communities.

The Earthworks communities are also being designed to also provide for the long term energy and food security for our families and our community in changing times.

Earthwalk Eco Education Center is sponsoring and facilitating the creation of t Earthworks designed eco communities in Canada. 

We are always looking for a canvas upon which we can mindfully create a truly sustainable communities. Communities where you can enjoy not only the real possibility of food and energy security but a very healthy and inspiring environment as well. 

Earthworks Eco Villages not only provide us with  a wonderful place to live but a place to learn, a place to create, a place to work and a place to play all in the context of the ecological principals of our natural world.

EARTHWORKS ECO VILLAGES are being designed using sustainable development principles to be examples of optimized ecologically based community living. The site plans apply permaculture principles to provide community resources that work with and are inspired by our natural support systems.

This is a grand opportunity to learn from the past, integrate with the present and create the kind of future that we all want.

There are many ways to participate in Earthworks projects as students, volunteers, consultants, eco businesses, suppliers, sponsors, and as community members. So if creating a sustainable future is of interest to you then please explore how you can participate in the Earthworks projects.

      <name>Walden Prepper Homestead Survival Farm</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22431&quot;&gt;Walden Prepper Homestead Survival Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Create and sustain a highly self-reliant off-grid community, composed of good, positive, friendly, compatible-enough people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/walden-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/walden-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I'm interested in forming a rural community in Saskatchewan.  Land not yet acquired.  It must be bought or leased.  I want to create a quiet, natural, peaceful, safe, fairly remote, private place which emphasizes prepping and self-reliance.  Chickens, farm animals, honeybees, organic gardens, greenhouses, off-grid energy, wilderness skills, hunting and gathering, pioneer practices, old time knowledge, skills and tools, modern methods and gear, etc, etc.  The best of what is old and new to help us make living on the land very possible and comfortable as we like it to be.  There can be no doubt that we are heading into rough times and hard times.   I think the best and most sustainable living to be had will be in isolated, cooperative, rural communities with high levels of independence from the outside world and DIY ideas, skills and attitudes, as well as goods and services to sell and barter with others.  But working for money is also necessary for many of us until the collapses come.  Ideally, the land we acquire has woods and also clearings.  Near a lake would be nice, too.  I prefer mostly separate homes, cuz I like my private space as wwell as being with others, but members can do as they choose.  Alternative construction methods welcome.  

Community named after Thoreau's book &quot;Walden&quot;, due to themes of 1) Retreat  2) Respecting, Admiring and Learning From Nature  3) Increased Self-Reliance (Increased Self-Sufficiency)  4) Objective Analysis Of Everything  5) Introspection, Self-Discovery and Questing for Wisdom.

Not a shared-income community, but the costs, work, planning and vision must of course be shared.  This started out as an idea about the way I want to live and it's still that, but now it's also my idea of how we will HAVE to live, in my opinion, dues to deteriorating global economic, environmental and social conditions.

Cooperative, wholesome, intelligent, joyful, creative, practical, sustainable, secure living is the goal.  Sense of humour required and high tolerance of varied politics, culture, ethnicity, spiritual beliefs and practices, and of people with no politics or spiritual beliefs.  I don't like being with people who all have the same few narrow ideas and can't stand diversity, but obviously we have to have enough common ground to make it work.  Good if you have some rural skills already, but willingness to learn is the main thing.  I grew up on a farm and still live on one.  I have a fair bit of rural know-how and I study homesteading topics, collect books, etc.  Potentially anyone can survive what is coming to the world if they have the right attitude and gain some good strategies.

Lots of space in this region, lots and lots of land and a low population, and lots of natural beauty and natural resources.  Currently, we have four distinct seasons here.  (Meaning that Weather Weirding is increasingly a factor everywhere and is changing normals.)  Winters are long, but can be enjoyable.  There are many interesting, enjoyable, useful things to do in wintertime in this part of the world, indoors and out, but you need a good dwelling and some other things.  Summers are normally nice, with up to 20 hrs of daylight.  Many types of vegetables, fruit, berries and many other things grow well here.

Nothing for Walden Farm has been started, so far, so discussing things is the first step towards any possibilities, plans, acquisition of land, etc.   I will update this when things get rolling.</description>

Our community is five years old with 3 adults. It was founded  March 2012. There are openings for 10 to 15 members. 

We have purchased a huge building in Besseges, France (Gard), have begun the first phase of renovation and have started our veggie garden. We have bees and 10 chickens. We have also started an artist residency and our cantine is open for organic, vegetarian noon meals for the public.

We have weekly work days and organizational meetings every weeks based on consensus.

Our community offers living and work space for permanent members or only work space for members living in the area.  

We  have a sewing workshop, metal/wood workshop and a forge is being developed. We are searching for ideas to have  cottage industries.

Private quarters will remain small and the community spaces will include a kitchen, a laundry room, bathrooms, library, two multi purpose spaces for exhibits,workshops meetings, theatre, concerts, office space for the association...

The founding members have created an association which owns the building. 

Permanent members loan money to the association while living and working within the community. If they decide to leave they will be reimbursed without interest after leaving.  

Supporting members also loan money which enables us to auto finance the renovation. But we will also be looking for various subsidies. We have been able to purchase the building with membership loans so far. We do not intend to use bank loans.

Permanent and active members pay a monthly contribution to the association to cover expenses : food, water, electricity, insurance, taxes ...
And of course we renovate ecologically : wood burning furnace, solar, natural insulation...

Hello my name is Dan and this page is about my endeavor to create community and how to be more caring in our dealings with others and the lives we touch. Currently have a 13 acre wooded property that a gentleman has moved onto and has started clearing out the land and preparing the spot for more people and creating a large garden for everyone. He has been involved with communities for nearly 40 years so he is helping to form this community there. He has a candle making business and a nonprofit called the plowshare project where they teach kids how to garden at school.

Connect with me on here or by phone 302-601-1395 and we can talk about how we might be able to live/work together in the future. 

Our long term goal is to be sustainable and live in a more natural setting, perhaps setup a few ecovillages where we can do so.

Btw, if you are just curious about community, join the facebook forum so that others in or around Delaware can connect about community: http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_203536936324052&amp;amp;ap=1

We strive to grow a lot of our own food, live in harmony with nature, and model what a permaculture community can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/headwaters-garden-learning-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/headwaters-garden-learning-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Headwaters Garden and Learning Center is built around a shared ethic of land stewardship, reverence for nature, mutual support and respect, and a sustainable life. We strive to build a resilient web of relationships between our community, ourselves, nature, and spirit. We want to cultivate food, energy, and our human spirit to honor all our relations, and thereby eliminate impoverishment and exploitative relationships with Earth and humanity. 

Our shared work on the land, in our neighborhoods, and in our local and global community will build a healthy environment to support our children and grandchildren for many generations to come, and we aspire to make all our decisions with future generations, all beings and relations, peace, and justice in mind.

We have received a permit for eight homes and one tiny house, and four of the homes are now completed and another one will begin in Summer of 2016.  It is a condominium form of ownership - people buy a home site, not a lot, and build their own house.  We hope to have a tiny house to rent for people who want to try life with a smaller footprint or visit the village for a short time by Summer of 2016. Camping visits are possible as well, and we have a small guest house.</description>

      <name>Akakor Pagan Permaculture Farming Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22435&quot;&gt;Akakor Pagan Permaculture Farming Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Self-sovereign permaculture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/akakor-pagan-permaculture-farming-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/akakor-pagan-permaculture-farming-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Liberty, Love and Honour eternal.

We are natural lifestyle Pagan spirits with strong sustainable permaculture ethics.

We are nature loving progressive naturalists/nudists in tune with Gaia and cosmic consciousness.  We consider ourselves &quot;space-tribe&quot; - of the greater family of souls throughout the cosmos.  As important as our physical &quot;3D&quot; reality is, for us, spirit comes first - lifestyle second.

Akakor is our home as much as it is our business, and our plans are as realistic today as they are forward-thinking towards the future.

Ethanol fuel production from Hemp greens and cleans the planet instantly, both locally and globally.  We have spent years planning this business and community and have all the facts available regarding zero carbon emissions and transition fuels for the population during this age as we travel through 2012 and beyond into smaller sustainable self-reliant communities of the future (rather than large over-consuming cities choking on industrial pollution).

We can produce our own power from our own green fuel as well!  This is a huge bonus for us as a sustainable independent permaculture community.

Organic farming is viable for both local food production and self-sustainability and is equally important for our community farm although not the focus of our initial business plans.  We wish to help the world heal around us as much as gain land for our future survival together in peace while utilizing a realistic common-sense business model to build from.

The founder of this community started many years ago as a freelance investigative journalist which partly led to some of the knowledge added to this project.

Our primary household is Pagan, vegetarian, polyamorous, omnisexual, progressive nudist, exopolitically involved, etc... an independent, self-sovereign &quot;nation&quot; of growing people... a home where animals &quot;are people too&quot; who deserve as much love as we share among ourselves.

We are open to applications from new members at this time.  Screening will be thorough, and security and future-minded.  This is a massively important vision which will not stray from its course.

The future farm is located in the British Columbia interior.</description>

And Lightworkers -- i.e., those who are daily practicing lightwork for personal and planetary upliftment -- might be drawn to locations and certain souls to increase our intuitive-spiritual insights together 
 Presently, the &quot;Desert Light Circle&quot; is a small developing retreat. Short-term visits -- perhaps even a day or weekend away from the &quot;big city&quot;, but also possibly longer-term visitors esp. Lightworkers who resonate and work well together... Welcome students/seekers (and enlightened friends) seeking spiritual enlightenment! And increasing knowingness of our individual and collective purpose with Mother Earth and all fellow cosmic Beings  welcome communication with fellow brothers and sisters of Light anytime -- email me -- even if you might not visit here...have awareness to share................

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22438&quot;&gt;Heart Land&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; nature, shared land and water, fire safety&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/heart-land/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/heart-land/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We have 13 owners and 120 acres which is paid in full. It's a canyon with an old live oak forest and artesian spring. However, in 38 years we have never had anything like a community. It's more like a neighborhood of camps where 1 of 13 owners lives full time year round, 1 full time but leaves for 4 months in the summer and 1 part time weekly. That group has created an off grid solar water pumping system. Some visit occasionally and the rest think of it as a real estate investment and live elsewhere. Some are supportive of what we do on the land and others are not.

At my camp, I've had many years to build my own tiny house. My latest additions are what I call the art layer. (mosaic tile in the kitchen, carved wood decorating the sleeping loft and rock work in a few places around the exterior) I'm growing food in a few small irrigated cages to keep the animals out. I have created two hugelkultur beds which harvest rainwater draining off the fire road. I've had some success at growing a variety of vegetables, berries, stone fruits and almonds. Beyond my camp, I've made a network of trails. In the live oak woods are some granite rock outcroppings where a seasonal creek flows down through small pools. Morteros for grinding acorns are found here in the granite rock. Native plants are: miner's lettuce, watercress, prickly pear cactus, acorns and more. Red rocks in the shape of a heart are embedded in a bluff that juts out from the upper area of the land. I was married at that spot. I think the land is still very beautiful. I like the camp I have made and wish others shared my vision.</description>

We are currently 6 families  living on 132 acres of forested land, on the Olympic Peninsula.  We founded the Tenancy in 1974, and have since granted an easement that made our property a part of our local land trust. We each live in our own homes, have both individual and shared gardens, woodlands, orchard and tiny vineyard, and we share some equipment.  We see ourselves as stewards of our land, taking care of it while it takes care of us. We live next door to Olympic National Park, and the Little River runs through our property.</description>

We're looking to unite with others who may be looking to form a striving to live in Torah based community.  The vision that we have is one in which we unite (become echad) to buy a piece of land somewhere. (we have bought land and houses in N MS ?)  or (where ever the RUACH (Set apart holy spirit leads us - right now in N MS) Where we may  develop our hearts, minds and bodies to serve the MOST HIGH YHVH and His son YAHHUASHUA led by the RUACH HA CHODESH  and to be able to produce as much of our basic needs (food, water, shelter, energy, heat, etc.). This community would be for folks who are seeking the truth of the creator YHVH and his son our redeemer Yahshua Ha Maschiach through the revelation given to us in his word the Torah, (laws or commandments) the prophets and the writings {Holy Bible).  We're looking for folks that are able to get along with people who are searching for the truth of the sacred Scriptures and if they have differing views on issues concerning the chodesh set apart holy names, the moedim holy chodesh set apart dates and how they are observed, the wearing of beards, tzitzits, kippahs,(whether you wear them or not)  women's roles and clothing, whether you feel that you must use their Sacred names and how or not to use them at all, if you still use the name of Jesus ? Yahshua or not (by what name did you first come to His knowledge?).  I'm looking for people that are understanding enough to know that you must learn to love your neighbor as yourself and let people worship the Son and the Father as they feel led to.  This is not to say that that we should wink at sin and allow open sin in the camp.  This is meant to give people the freedom and room to allow for variations in the way people honor Our Creator in the manner in which we feel led to.  I'm looking to join up with people can agree to love their neighbors even if they do something that they may not completely agree with.  Bottom line is if you see what's coming down the road and you still want to argue and disagree about all things mentioned above and any other points that I'm sure I missed, please don't reply to this posting, but if you can see the writing on the wall for this nation and would like to become as echad (united) as you can with others (on the points you can be united on and leaving the ones you're not aside for study), then please by all means contact me as soon as possible!</description>

Phase 1 consists of 12 acres of flat land, with over 2 acres of preserved green space in the center for gardens, gathering and recreation. Homes are placed around the perimeter of the green space creating a pocket neighborhood through garden development design.

2014 promises to be a breakout year for the community.  We have two new houses going up.  One is a large pole barn/residence and the other is a tradition log home. As the national housing market improves,  interest in the the community increases. A recent segment on NPR about development supported agriculture helped me define exactly what we are doing here. Instead of golf courses , people are choosing developments that have food production built in.  At our farm/community, Green Bridge Farm, the produce is also organic!

Age is not an issue however we expect adult behavior without supervision.
There are miles of hiking here, volcanoes within walking distance.  
Rooms and RV spaces are rented.  Just off the highway it is still quiet here a good place to
reflect and heal. 
Micah Village is located off Interstate 25 miles east 7 miles on US hwy 60 MM172.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22446&quot;&gt;Etherion Ringing Cedars Intentional Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Positive Vision Passion Action&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/etherion-ringing-cedars-intentional-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/etherion-ringing-cedars-intentional-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
ETHERION means DIVINE, Anastasia/Ringing Cedar books are a guiding principle, as are Conversations with God, Castaneda, Permaculture, Yoga etc, but we recognize all denominations &amp; are open-minded.
701 hectares (1734 acres) of Northern Tablelands paradise, purchased May 2008 with an established homestead &amp; independent solar power system. Superb climate at 1200m, 32C max ever (no bushfires), 900mm rainfall, geologically stable, very high light levels year round. Unlike traditional communities, the Ringing Cedar model allows a union of opposites, one hectare (2.5 acre) domains bordered by living, not dead, fences, preserving individuality &amp; personal creativity, surrounded by a collective village of inter-dependent domains.

VISION STATEMENT
Etherion has characteristics of the heavenly, where our soul life, social experiences and ecology reflect the goodness of love, creation, simplicity and balance. We’ll live on top of a mountain.....(more, see website).
SPIRITUALITY
Realising our selves and our relationships with each other and our earth lies at the heart of our intention. Balance and harmony will be created by the soulful living of each person. The love and energy created by our spiritual lives will bring about joy and harmony, humbleness, purity and giving.....Meditations, yogic living, holistic living and ceremonies.....
COMMUNITY
Our community has been created for all ages, children to elders. Love for each other through family and friendship is our achievement. We are self-governing therefore the communal life we aim to create is one of peace, appreciation, fun, action and accepting. We are a gift community, whereby if someone is in need, their needs are met.....
ECOLOGY
Living in harmony with our earth brings a way of being which is sacred and healthy. Nourishing and supporting her requires gift energy too. To nourish the soils, keep water ways clean, encourage the presence of wildlife, waste minimally, enhancing the forest, requires us to live in certain ways. Our homes will be built from the earth or recycled items, our energy will be created by us.....
AESTHETICS
Being a community of young to elder, of diverse talents and interests, of various spiritual paths, our village will be reflective of all we give and want. We will build a village of cluster homes.....these include a community centre with a kitchen and stage for our entertainment and visitors, a school for our children.....This picture is not complete… as it is missing your d

This community project is currently on hold as we reorganize our efforts to be able to better meet the needs of the human collective currently incarnate. The original community description is below. Please read on and feel free to email us if you'd like to be contacted when we restart. 
We have met many beautiful soulmates on the journey towards creating a sustainable spiritually-focused community. However, it has become clear that very few are ready at this time to be part of a full-blown community building effort long term. This has resulted in a lot of turn-over and a lot of visitors, which has impeded progress. Instead of struggling with this situation and only being able to serve the very few who are ready for true heart-centered, spiritually-aware community, we have decided to reorganize and form a retreat center of sorts, likely a meditation sanctuary where classes will be offered, so that we can meet the needs of the many. This restructuring will require a lot of changes and more money. We are in the process of making those changes and raising the money needed to continue. We anticipate 2014 as being the year in which we will be able to restart in earnest. Please send us an email and we will keep you in the loop. Blessings and thanks for your interest.

      <name>Kalikalos</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22449&quot;&gt;Kalikalos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Summer community in Greece&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kalikalos/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kalikalos/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Kalikalos is a seasonal summer community located in the Pelion region of Greece, established by the Holly Foundation (a 501(C)3 not-for-profit educational trust) to demonstrate the value of authentic community as a vehicle for a new culture of peace, partnership and sustainability. Our mission is to show that by sharing, working, learning, and playing together, each of us—by living our own unique truths—can heal ourselves and our planet. 

*

We are an educational project, in effect a living-learning community-based summer school, running each year for five months from mid-May through mid-October in Greece. The core community consists of two or three full-time members and up to half a dozen transient volunteers who stay for periods of one to five months, receiving food and accommodation in exchange for their work in the community.  Our income is derived from workshops, retreats, work-camps, and conferences in the areas of healing (self and planet), personal creativity, interpersonal communication, and Self-enquiry. 

*

Our aim is to provide a temporary but authentic community environment for our guests and participants to practice living the values and insights gained through the holistic courses offered here.

*

The international community group that holds the Centre is inspired by the Findhorn ecovillage in northern Scotland, employing many of the processes developed there, including particularly attunement with nature, focalisation of work, and Way of Council. Our decisions are mostly made through consensus. We have a large organic vegetable garden that incorporates permaculture principles. We are located in the Pelion forest, a lush green ecosystem about seven kilometers from spectacular Aegean beaches. 

*

We are always open to new temporary community members, who usually come to us first on a two-week trial basis during which we ask for a small financial contribution (currently $200). 

*

During the winter months community members disperse, but many of them continue to work for the community doing fund raising, PR, web design, brochure layout, and other administrative jobs in preparation for the following summer in Greece.

It is a permaculture farm and a growing intentional community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bosque-village-san-galileo/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bosque-village-san-galileo/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Bosque Village is located in a safe area in the highlands of Michoacan, Mexico near Patzcuaro. We are collecting independent and responsible people who lead a healthy active lifestyle to add to our little group.

We have solar panels, rain capture, composting toilets, solar ovens, solar food dehydration, food forest gardens, chickens, rabbits, an art studio, wood fired sauna etc. 
We build with cob, and would like to make examples of most types of eco-construction. 

The current options for living with us include:

* Coming as a participant. Optimal candidates have skills we need, have a self-motivated working attitude, and are driven to help the Bosque system succeed. We are focused on producing videos to share our cultural experiments. All participants must apply. 

* Developing your compatible business here. 
 You could use the Bosque space to do your yoga or meditation workshops. English teachers and Spanish teachers could offer their services. Leading retreats and providing guest services. Your could teach permaculture or ecobuilding courses. What vision do you have to create?

* An Alternative: Become a neighbor. There are properties and houses near the Bosque which are available for rent or purchase. This area is full of interesting people and is becoming a large community of environmentally-minded folks! Foreigners can legally own land in Mexico. (Except on the coast, but we are in the highlands.)

The best way to get involved is to visit the Bosque as a participant to see how you like the area, the forest, and the people.

The Shire is located on 90 acres in Hawaii. The community infrastructure includes dry spaces, hot showers, and kitchen facilities. 

15 hours a week of WWOOFing as well as support for propane and other costs is appreciated. The Shire is a bio-intensive farm with permaculture and agroforestry. 

Honest communication is the foundation for our community life. We also explore construction of farm infrastructure using local and recycled materials. 

We encourage craftspeople, artisans, and other cultural creatives to come and participate as artists in residence.  We encourage ownership participation in our community to support infrastructure development.  We are seeking grant funding for development of an agriculturally based Hawaiian Healing Retreat.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22457&quot;&gt;Clearwater Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We share an intention of living a lifestyle that sustains a balance between individual and community needs and the natural ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/clearwater-commons/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/clearwater-commons/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Clearwater Commons is an intergenerational residential community, with participants ranging from small children to elders. We began forming in June 2006 when a group of families purchased a 7.4-acre site on North Creek, 11 miles north of the Seattle, Washington, city limits. The site includes wetlands, wooded spaces, and a salmon stream. As of March 2016 there are six completed and occupied homes, one home under construction, a common shop, shed, garden and a 300sf passive guest house.

When complete the community will have 16 residences (a mix of two and three-bedroom town homes and single family residences) plus a common house. Six families currently reside here; one home under construction and eight home sites are available for sale.

The physical design of the community represents our underlying values of community and low-impact development. Pedestrian walkways, community gardens, benches, shared shop, tool and storage sheds, and play spaces reflect our desire to interact with neighbors through the natural course of our days.

The inspiration for this community grew from founding members’ involvement in The Clearwater School, located across the street. Our shared experience with the school encourages us to allow the structures for community meetings, gatherings, and events to evolve through our daily interactions, rather than follow a preset or mandated framework.

We take on a responsibility to act as stewards of our land—-restoring and enhancing the natural environment, including the stream, wetlands, habitat, and wildlife. We value relationships between individuals, families, and our environment, and promote a lifestyle that will sustain these relationships. We trust each family to make decisions that are aligned with our intent of sustainability and that balance individual autonomy and community needs. We expect that the specific commitments of our community will change over time, and we wish to avoid hard and fast rules. We value communication and discussion and take the time needed to voice, discuss, and understand diverse perspectives in order to reach informed and conscious decisions.</description>

Eco Truly Park is a beautiful, ecological, self-sufficient, artistic community on the Pacific Coast of Peru. Residents and volunteers live together according to the principles of non-violence, which is a core principle here, and visitors can learn and experience how it is possible to live happily in harmony with nature, others, and themselves.

The architecture and values of the community are inspired, in part, by traditional Indian teachings and lifestyle. We are the first lively ecological educational center of Peru. We have inspired similar successful projects in neighboring countries such as Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, and Bolivia.

In the last 22 years we have developed a unique organic awareness, cultivation, and ecological program run by an increasing number of members and volunteers. The community is 2.5 meters above sea level and previously consisted of completely sandy, unworkable land. Today our community is visited by both Lima residents and international visitors, who are able to experience an alternative way of life. The surrounding area of the Huaral province has thus been influenced positively in terms of the ecological consciousness of its people. 

We are strategically located in Chacra y Mar beach, district of Aucallama, province of Huaral, one hour north of Lima, and very visible from the well known Panamericana Norte road. 

Please drop in anytime to enjoy our ecological lodging (hotel), gardens, and restaurant--our doors are always wide open and everything is very reasonably priced! 

Volunteer Program:
You are welcome to participate in our volunteer program. We hope we can provide you with the experience of living in a community and learning through helping.

Remember that you are coming to join a group of people living together. This is a community group and it's a nonprofit community. There is a Vaisnava Ashram here too.

We are a spiritual, holistic, educational Retreat Center which has been in operation for 15 years. We are looking for environmentally aware individuals to create a long-lasting resource center that continues for generations to come.

We are looking for summer help and long-term people who want to commit to a vision of creating a Findhorn Foundation-style community and education center in Canada. We are really interested in people with Permaculture skills as well as Sociocractic skills and love meditators and yogis.

The Center is a drug, tobacco, and alcohol-free environment and serves vegetarian food.

Our website has a page to give you the basic community information.
 
For the past 22 years, Angele has been publishing a regional holistic magazine for BC and AB called ISSUES for Empowerment. She also hosts the Spring Festival of  Awareness in the Spring and the Wise Womens Festival in the fall at Naramata Center, BC.  Visit www.issuesmagazine.net for details.

      <name>Kingfisher Cohousing on Brookdale</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22460&quot;&gt;Kingfisher Cohousing on Brookdale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to create Cohousing in our Brookdale Ave property, as described in the book &quot;Cohousing&quot; by McCamant and Durrett, with the following characteristics:

Architectural design that facilitates interaction, with a central courtyard
Parking separate from homes
A common house with shared facilities
Member managed
Shared work load
Common meals

This is a market-rate model, with a combination of rental apartments and condominiums for purchase with significant down payment required. We are not organized around any political or religious philosophy, only the desire to eat together, have a sense of community with good communication, and take care of our property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kingfisher-cohousing-on-brookdale/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kingfisher-cohousing-on-brookdale/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
formerly North Oakland Cohousing. 

I hope to create a community with people who are committed to collaboration, good communication, consensus-oriented decision making, and respect for each other.

I have an 8-unit apartment complex with a common house, built around a charming courtyard, in the Fruitvale district of Oakland, a few blocks below Hwy 580. The plan is for members to move in as the existing tenants naturally move out over time.  As of April 2018, 4 units are occupied by the tenants who were here when we purchased (very nice neighbors, and two are interested in being part of cohousing), I am also living on site, and 3 units will soon be available for cohousers, two as condominiums for sale and one rental. Whether this develops into cohousing or just a friendly complex depends on who moves in here.

     Our diet is mostly vegetarian; we're non-smokers, and choose to not have a TV.  We get our news via NPR &amp; the internet.
     Brief meditation is part of our daily routine each morning; &amp; we attune to the nature spirits.  One of our influences is Sirius Community in MA, where one of us (Mike) spent 10 happy years.  
     We live in a 3-bdrm house, w/ 2 baths.  One of our rooms we are converting to a starter greenhouse.   And we have a 2-car garage w/ side sheds.
     There's a state-wide organic farmers group we're part of (OEFFA), w/ regular
local chapter mtgs.  
     Our aim is to establish  a more resilient &amp; sustainable garden-based homestead here.
     Books &amp; authors we're influenced by are: John Jeavons; Eliot Coleman;   &quot;Findhorn Garden&quot;; Tanis Helliwell's &quot;Summer with the Leprechauns;&quot; Richard Heinberg; Paul Von Ward; Robert Shapiro's &quot;Explorer Race;&quot; Zecharia Sitchin; Graham Hancock; &amp; Neale Walsch.

      <name>Gathering Our Tribe - A Prepper Haven</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22463&quot;&gt;Gathering Our Tribe - A Prepper Haven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Survival Community where we've lived food/energy self-reliantly for 24 years, where community is the glue holding us together&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/gathering-our-tribe-a-prepper-haven/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/gathering-our-tribe-a-prepper-haven/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We're Daniel &amp; Patti EarthStewards, a couple who have been long time Homesteaders and Preppers. We've lived a back-to-the-land food and energy self-reliant lifestyle since 1990, with a previous study of these lifestyles and preparations since the late 70's.

We realized years ago the importance of preparing for social, political, economic and environmental changes which are unfolding. Recently we felt it was time to organize a Prepper Haven on our farm located north of Spokane, WA. 

Available for sale is an 8 acre piece of land with it own debt free deed that sit next to the community's land. This land is forested and has a year around stream running thru it. 

We also have available in 99 year leases on sites on the community's land where members may construct Cabins or set up temporary housing and develop their site for their long term retreating. Also offered are Associate, Founding &amp; Volunteer Memberships.

The Hopi advice we tap into as a guide for this Haven can be read at: http://www.communityworks.info/hopi.htm Especially significant to us are the questions the Hopi asked...

&quot;What are you doing? What are your relationships? Are you in right relation? Where are you living? Where is your water?&quot; Also...&quot;Know your garden&quot;.

We at Gathering Our Tribe have been asking ourselves the same type of questions since the late 1970's. We're as prepared as any survival community could be to positively respond to these questions.

Our intention with Gathering Our Tribe is to establish an embankment to grab hold of, where Preppers of good will may gather together when the rivers of change are sweeping us all downstream. And like the Hopi advised, we're reaching out to see who would like to be there with us. 

We're serious about THRIVING in this time of uncertainty and have planned for the dollar collapse, earth changes and civil unrest. If you, like us, are feeling that weird vibe and sense something is coming, but you cannot put your finger on it, then you have met the right people to talk to about this at Gathering Our Tribe. We are doers, not talkers, and we want to be joined by those of like mind.

Interested Preppers in the above may communicate with us via this web listing and/or go to our Facebook page where we've uploaded photos there to show our members what is established at this embankment. 

If this sounds like what you have been looking for, and you've been longing to make a connection to a self-reliant Prepper Haven, then take a step and contact us to see what can be worked out here at Gathering Our Tribe.</description>

(Heal Earth And Life)Think of H.E.A.L. as a very cool, well organized tool shed for humanity.  

It is our hope to give an environmental example in our community of how man can live as one with nature, using all of our renewable energy sources, feed ourselves good healthy organic food, experiment with best eco friendly building practices while teaching others to do the same. Do you have some ideas for making our project better? There´s plenty of room, and we welcome you to be a part of this working/teaching environmental classroom.

H.E.A.L. has a simple belief. This planet is our home! There is a definite connection between its health and ours. We as a generation are moving to new heights with our ability to rejuvenate, renovate, and resupply our bodies and minds with so much that is good for us. Let’s do the same for the place we live, our home, this planet. There is power in the masses and their movement. These days that movement is towards hope. Look around you and you will see it everywhere. We at H.E.A.L. would like to identify the problems, present the solutions and put them in the hands of the people who can make a difference, YOU!
 
We need your help to find the sharpest tools on the planet: those people who know the answers, who know how to fix what's damaged or broken—the experts at global and human restoration. We want to support them and pay them to do what they do best, provide solutions! If you are interested in this adventure please contact us and hey, thanks for being HERE!

Updates:

The duplex at 429 and 431 N. Hamilton Avenue, 46201 is for sale. It is the next building to the north. Here is a link to details: https://www.realestate.com/429-n-hamilton-ave-indianapolis-in-46201--1088844 . Also, there is a newly refurbished house a short walk away on the 400 block of Jefferson Avenue. Here's a link for a three bedroom rental/rent to own:  https://indianapolis.craigslist.org/reo/d/rent-rent-to-own-3-bedrooms-2/6695822333.html . 

A not for profit is in the process of acquiring abandoned housing in our neighborhood to restore and sell to home owners. Several of us are assembling a group to integrate appropriate technologies into these sites. Examples are photovoltaic, passive geothermal and greenhouses. We have yet to make definite designs. 

Available are bedrooms with shared common spaces ($320 - 450 monthly). The landlord is in touch with nearby landlords who might have vacancies in entire apartments and houses that are for rent and or for sale. 

By the way, nearby Phoenix Urban Farm is making tremendous strides with its gardening, hoop house and Fifth Friday Art Shows https://www.facebook.com/events/1602650446529737/ .  

Current projects:
early planning to fix up and occupy nearby abandoned duplexes, 
building repair and maintenance (especially gutter work and minor roofing),
food forest development,
getting rental bedrooms and housing occupied,
gardening,
and 
mutual support (e.g., facilitating one each others goals, barter, finding nearby housing for quality neighbors).

Additional concerns:
starting a local internet service,
finding buyers for nearby housing,
and 
bringing in and starting businesses. 

Permaculturalists, edible landscapers and foraging experts are very welcome. Also, fundraising activity is invited to enhance the economic, agricultural and ecological activity. I would delight in having green and community minded people live in the nearby rentals and housing that is for sale. Bedrooms with shared common spaces are for rent in the duplex. WWOOFers (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) are encouraged to consider collaborating here; shelter and food can be worked out. 
  
---------------------------- 

Greg is willing to help place quality people in bedrooms, apartment and houses. Development of the community's direction is ongoing. 
===

Of ongoing concern to Greg is how to make the neighborhood better without the negatives that can come with neighborhood  improvement. We need to raise up everyone. Any social workers or social work minded people interested? Ecological matters, including education and advocacy, are vital concerns.
===

The physical boundaries of the community are intended to be broader than building's site. Nearby is the Green Shepherd project, Fruit Loop Acres farm and Basic Roots Community Foods distribution, and a community garden.
===


At minimum we would be a group focused on the well being of our members.
===


Greg's foci are to be landlord, farmer, facilitator of community and advocate for ecological matters. Members, and supporters, are invited to collaborate with him. Some complimentary services that he suggests are: 
a bike shop, 
online sale of bike parts, 
grant researcher and writer,
fundraiser,
bookkeeper, 
hauling, 
building improvement, 
landscaping, 
soil improvement, 
internet service, 
foraging,
an arts center, 
permaculture courses and consultation, an agricultural apprenticeship program, and a nature conservation and restoration corps.
===


Minimum requirements for residential membership:
1. Concern for the impact of our ecological footprint.
2. Willingness to engage in enhancing our quality of life. 
3. Payment of monthly bills for housing, utilities, and enhancements. Typical price is $300 - $450 monthly per bedroom. Barter can be included. 

The four bedroom apartment rents for around $700 per month; utilities are not included.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22466&quot;&gt;Brave New Mountain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Great law of the 5 nations = Solution to those major problems faced by your great grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/brave-new-mountain/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/brave-new-mountain/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;It’s natural that creative folks who don’t fit the American lifestyle will desire belonging to a special community, and as expected, most intentional communities listed here identify with special interests. However, there are also intelligent folks who desire to work for true solutions intentionally in a caring community but who do not strongly identify with these established labels of dietary, drug, schooling, social, religious, sexual, leadership and political stereotypes. Whether one eats sprouts, tofu or road kill is not important. It seems that many of these behaviors, rules, rights, superstitions are counter-productive to the freethinking required to create solutions for a bright future. 
A great problem faces the “civilized” world. Whether it’s about energy, food, water, housing, transportation, brainpower, or businesses, most (over 80 percent) of America’s resources are obscenely wasted. 
Though difficult for a lone person, it is possible with resource-based economy that a community’s consumption can be reduced to a small fraction of the average, while productive adventures (gardening, hiking, creation, research, learning, invention, travel, laughter, reading, writing, free time) can be dramatically increased. Freedom for all can very simply replace the current sad situation of slavery for most.
This forming Mountain-based community already has 20+ acres of pristine forest mountain, equipment, a sawmill, free hydropower, treehouse resources, etc, and is ready for activity. We seek very rare independent (non-labeled) folks and families who desire a wholesome, intelligent problem-solving community.  
Many folks are confused and fearful of the future, some want to go back to the past. “Little house on the prairie” is quaint, but can world solutions for a great future come from an uninformed viewpoint? Similarly, it seems unlikely that a heavily labeled special-interest community will actually have the time to invent a great future. 
Finding the economic and technical answers to a practical “new world” future requires intelligent people with skills to build true solutions. If you understand that true progress takes change and that the future is not the past, please write SPECIFICALLY (no time for those average bulk spammers).</description>

We are looking for young families to fill the last two spots for our intergenerational cohousing community within the city limits of Gainesville, FL. We own a 4.75 acre property where we intend to build 24 homes with an extensive common house, gardens, fruit trees, a playground, a pool, and a large dining hall that doubles for a dance floor.  Groundbreaking was on February 3rd, 2017.

The Goddess's Temple Wiccan Village is a center for training in Wicca. It is a school where many seasoned priestesses and priests are available to impart their knowledge and life experiences with people interested in threading a Wiccan sacerdotal pathway or in knowing that pathway better.

We are a center for communal living, studying and celebrating the Goddess. We have places dedicated to worshiping, to learning, and to living a pagan lifestyle.

Though this is a Wiccan community, we may accept members of all creeds, as long as they abide to Brazilian legislation against religious prejudice, and agree to participate in all community's activities that are not religion oriented.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

Left original information on here for historical/herstorical purposes since we were ‘intentional community’ for quite awhile...&amp;amp; we still do welcome prearranged visitors &amp;amp; sometimes long-termers from time to time...but rather than prioritizing people these days, our focus is on being a ‘wild nature sanctuary’ that respects/nurtures the ability of the land to heal with the Divinely Feminine Compassion so needed everywhere on Planet Earth at this time.

The original Founder occasionally welcomes new or old friends, but in general time here is now more about sweet interactions with the land, spiced with occasional one-on-one human interactions of depth...(rather than all the busy personalities &amp;amp; activities we used to juggle years ago!)

So...if you're looking for a sweet, rustic, peaceful place to do creative work...deepen a spiritual practice...learn new spirit skills...or just have time to BE, occasionally around like-hearted others, this could be it. :) Check out our current web presence to see what we are now &amp;amp; what kinds of interactions we're open to...&amp;amp; contact us if what you find there feels like a good fit! http://kulanagoddesssanctuary.blogspot.com.

General along with more focussed sharing of sacred time/space here (such as island-wide mystery-school interactions with the Founder) can be scheduled in support of an overall priority to: rebalance/repattern the Matrix while stewarding this unconventional, contemplative, substance-use (smoke/alcohol/drug)-FREE, laid-back, creative environment that embodies eco-friendly, low-impact sustainability in a tropical rainforest that’s kept intentionally unconquered these days.

Longer-term studies + partial-work-exchange experiences also sometimes possible. Inquire. :)

If you'd like to hear more about our adventures in the creation &amp;amp; living of Intentional Community through the years, Kulana's Founder &amp;amp; friends have these books in the world -- fiction &amp;amp; non-fiction -- which are available in both print &amp;amp; e-editions:

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22470&quot;&gt;ElderSpirit Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to be a participatory community of mutual support in which all spiritual paths are respected and encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/elderspirit-community-at-trailview/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/elderspirit-community-at-trailview/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;ElderSpirit Community is a cohousing community for mixed income elders (55 and over) located on 3.7 acres alongside the Virginia Creeper Trail in Abingdon, Virginia. Its distinctive intentions are mutual support through the aging process and late-life spirituality. Members believe that spiritual growth is the primary work of those in the later stages of life. Agreeing that freedom of religion is fundamental, we encourage one another in the search for meaning and commitment to the spiritual path of our choice. Through face-to-face relationships, we offer and receive support, express our needs and convictions, listen carefully to each other, and strive to act responsibly, considering our good, the good of the other, and the good of the community.  

Thirteen of the cluster homes belong to owners; sixteen apartment homes are for renters, who must qualify as low-to-moderate income. The Common House is used for meals, meetings, entertainment and gatherings of all kinds. There are laundry facilities in the Common House. The Spirit Center is a special place for prayer, meditation, and celebrations.  Each member serves on at least one committee. Monthly meetings of the Members Association are run by consensus. Visitors who are interested in our community are welcomed. To learn more, visit our website www.elderspirit.org.  

Retreats and workshops are available for groups who have similar goals. For more information on retreats, contact Monica Appleby at 276-698-3289 or write mappleby@elderspirit.net. Dene Peterson addresses groups and meets with individuals who want to build cohousing communities in other locations. She can be reached at denepete@bvu.net.

We started construction in December 2017.   The homes will be completed in Spring 2019.

Our vision is for an inclusive, earth-friendly community that fosters supportive relationships based on respect, cooperation, and fun. We have purchased 3.7 acres of land in Fair Oaks. The site is close to the American River Parkway, Fair Oaks Village, Sacramento Waldorf School, Rudolf Steiner College, and Bannister Park. We are working with award-winning architect Chuck Durrett of McCamant &amp;amp; Durrett Architects and  development consultant Katie McCamant of CoHousing Solutions.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22473&quot;&gt;Oran Mor Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We live harmoniously with the land, loving and respecting all its inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/oran-mor/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/oran-mor/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Currently Seeking: Interns and Apprentices with knowledge of Natural Building and Permaculture or a willingness to learn!

We are a small egalitarian community and organic farm established in June of 2003 and situated on 113 acres in the hills of Ozark County, MO. The terrain is rocky with several creeks and we enjoy four distinctly, beautiful seasons.

We raise dairy goats, rabbits, egg chickens &amp;amp; ducks, geese, guineas, dogs n cats, and lots of vegetables using local organic inputs and no-till design. We grow extensive herb gardens and fruit trees. We work to put the principles of Permaculture into daily practice, using clean energy resources and recycling our waste as best we can. We are striving to minimize our reliance on fossil fuels and electricity as much as possible.

Our commitment to living simply translates to many lifestyle choices here. Our main communal building runs on solar power and has few ammenities. We have a trailer connected to the grid that powers the rest of the farm. We do all of our cooking on woodfires year round, which means cooking in our outdoor kitchen in the warmer months. Our laundry is done by hand and dried on clothes lines. Our dishes are done by hand using rain water heated on our woodfire. Our shower water is also heated on the woodstove. These are some central differences to what most folks are used to. It is a commitment of time and effort, and we feel it is rewarding and pays off. We love life and we have fun with our commitments.

We offer a wide range of skilled and unskilled work experiences in gardening, cooking, canning, fermentation, sustainable construction, milking, cheesemaking, forestry, salvage, maintenance, and more. We have an ongoing need for alternative, ecologically aware construction, organic permaculture style gardening, home and land improvement, and hard workers with thoughtful conversations.

Length of stay is entirely negotiable. We are accepting new members. Meals are communal. WWOOFers will be expected to attend daily priority meetings and to take an active part in chores and projects. Opportunities are available year 'round. Very limited transportation is available. Children and pets are welcome with prior approval.

Alcohol is enjoyed occasionally. Some of us smoke.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22474&quot;&gt;Freedom-Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Egalitarian Cooperation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/freedom-universe/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/freedom-universe/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Freedom-Universe is an Egalitarian Intentional Community on 40 rural acres in north central Arizona with a small residential house in the town of Prescott, AZ.

This community is being built on a foundation of interpersonal relationships based on shared values such as conviviality, social tolerance, equality, honesty, and nonviolence.

Members can only join as sovereign individuals. There is no membership category available for traditional monogamous couples (married or not). Whatever consenting adult members agree to do (share) with each other is considered ethical and fair. Egalitarian Polyfidelity inside of Sacred Sexuality is the family structure for the Freedom-Universe Tribe and intentional family. The religious idea of &quot;original sin&quot; is not embraced here. The nude human body is not viewed as obscene, and in support of that view, this is a clothing optional tribe/family.

Environmental and economic sustainability will be pursued using renewable energy, sustainable building materials and techniques, permaculture, and organic/bio-dynamic gardening.

Greed and deception are reinforced in any system of economic hierarchy--whether it is capitalism, nazism, fascism, communism/totalitarianism, monarchy, or outright dictatorship--due to the erroneous cultural conditioning that competition is the only process that creates technological advances and improves economic prosperity. In an economic hierarchy, deception is observable in almost every marketing pitch made, where the goal is increasing consumerism, thereby redistributing the bulk of the wealth of the planet to an increasingly smaller percentage of its inhabitants. Correspondingly, this is to the economic detriment of the increasingly larger segment of the population now living below Maslow's basic hierarchy of needs, i.e., in poverty. Freedom-Universe will represent a model of egalitarian cooperation and sharing embodying the value of &quot;love thy neighbor as thyself,&quot; instead of competition, greed and deception.

Established in 1972, we are an urban housing cooperative that seeks to foster community and sustainable lifestyles. We are adults and children with ages ranging from seven to sixty-seven. We live in a large fifteen-bedroom house built in the early 1900s.

We share organic, vegetarian food, although few of our current members are vegetarian. We have at least one scheduled communal meal a month. Currently we practice a moderate form of income sharing in which members pay a portion of their income to the community in addition to payments for base dues and food.

We seek to live a more environmentally sustainable and communitarian lifestyle. Title to our property is held by the Evergreen Land Trust.

A community of 13 townhomes existing since 2007.  The property includes a &quot;common house&quot; and garden. The homes are passive solar and have other green building features. The members acted as their own developer, entailing considerable commitment of time and money.  Homes are affordable for our area.

Located one mile from downtown Ashland near parks, schools, and a bike path, this is in-town housing in a small town.  We have several families with young children, as well as single and older members.  Biographies are available on our website, along with a values statement and other tidbits.

Homes range from one to four bedrooms and all have small private yards.  All homes have many south-facing windows, passive ventilation, radiant heat, and superior insulation, and they qualify for Earth Advantage, our local sustainable building certification.

We worked on this project for four and a half years. Since we acted as our own developer, all members contributed substantial time to the project.  We practice facilitation and group process skills and are committed to clean communications, caring about each other, and having fun. 

As a small community, we place a premium on getting to know people before they become members.  In the event a home goes up for sale, we maintain a list of interested buyers for sellers to use.

Our is focus is on sustainable living, farming, alternative energies (solar), permaculture, environmental issues, social justice, and pastured based farming. Community products include organic vegetables and eggs, ornamental trees, cane syrup, Water Buffalo dairy and native plants. We also have mechanic and wood-working shops. Community outreach activities include a sustainable living program (www.wmnf.org), farmers’ markets, and support of global community efforts. Carpentry, mechanic, or agricultural experience is a plus. Want-to-do projects: finishing the dairy, woodgas, electric tractor, etc. 

The mission at EcoFarm is to form a sustainable, eco-friendly, people-friendly, farm-based intentional community that provides for all the needs of community members. Members are community-minded. They are focused on maintaining the well-being of the community and striving towards increasing sustainability. Meaningful work, a social environment, and community activities cultivate an atmosphere of common purpose and shared experiences. Prospective members need no money to join, only should be free of debt and to have a willingness to put the community first. Visitations are by appointment.

We believe the world is at a critical-decision crossroads. The survival of our planet, indeed the human race, is at stake. Science has confirmed what we are witnessing first-hand; global warming, resource depletion, escalating population growth, mass extinctions, and other worldwide events demand that we adopt a more sustainable lifes. Our personal decisions in daily living are the key to changing this destructive course. We strive to help others in finding more sustainable solutions for everyday living through education and demonstration of subjects as native and edible landscaping, reuse, recycling, conservation, and more. Living in the Sunshine State, we place a strong emphasis on solar projects, such as solar heating, cooking, and electricity.

We have been creating an intentional community since 1982.
The Apex is a limited-equity housing cooperative located at First Avenue and Bell Street in Seattle's Belltown district. Apex provides its members with affordable housing and community facilities on a nonprofit basis. Apex seeks diversity of all types in its members and caters especially to people eligible for low-income housing.
We own it!
Apex members (there are about twenty-five of us) collectively own and operate 38% of the building (the upper two floors; the owner of ground level retail owns the remaining portion). This ownership translates to a lot of freedom, responsibility, and community involvement on the part of members.

holds it as sanctuary for education and cultural transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/emerald-earth/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/emerald-earth/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Emerald Earth is a 26-year-old intentional community in rural Mendocino County. We have 189 acres of mixed redwood and hardwood forest; open, south-facing meadows with majestic oaks; two springs; a pond; and a seasonal creek. The land is held in trust by a 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation.

Our values include sustainable living, simplicity, social and environmental justice, and reverence for the Earth and all living things. Our mission is to develop and demonstrate a model of living in harmony with the land and with each other. The original founding group was and is committed to developing our spiritual connection to the Earth through ritual, song, and seasonal celebrations.

We teach short workshops and longer professional training in natural building (including cob, strawbale, slipstraw, round pole framing, adobe floors, natural plasters, etc.) and permaculture. We are developing the infrastructure for 20 permanent residents plus guests, interns, and students. We use natural materials and our own labor to keep costs and environmental impact low. We are off grid, with solar and hydro-electricity, a cell phone, and satellite internet. We share meals, meet, and socialize in a common house that is still under construction. Each family or individual will have a small private cabin (six have been completed). We're also working on gardens, permaculture food forest, nursery, more ponds, etc.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22482&quot;&gt;Dancing Bones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Simply Living, Interdependently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/dancing-bones/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/dancing-bones/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Dancing Bones is located in the Baker River Valley and the entrance to the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The Connecticut River is a 20 minute drive and the Appalachian Trail is 1.4 miles from the end of our driveway. There are many other ponds, streams, lakes, hiking trails, rock climbing and camping opportunities close at hand, to say nothing of the wintertime activities. The nearest gas station is ten minutes away and the nearest major shopping destinations are 30+ minutes away.

The community is situated hillside, amongst 40 acres of deciduous forest. A 16x32 cabin functions as our community building with shared kitchen, shower and laundry. For overnight visitors, we have indoor, four season accommodations available. Peppered throughout are a handful of residential cabins. Each cabin is given a name that reflects the character of the person/people who originally built it or the function it serves. All residences and public privies use a humanure composting toilet system.

The land is held in a community trust. The trust is made of nine members, three from Dancing Bones and six from the greater community. The trust leases the land to Dancing Bones residents. All residential decisions are made using consensus.

We are ever striving to increase the interdependence of community relationships. Participants are emotionally, economically, ecologically and/or morally reliant on and responsible to each other.

While the residents of Dancing Bones are diverse, there are common values and interests we share. These values include deliberate decision making and action, personal responsibility and social inclusion and involvement. As a result, our interests tend towards unschooling, attachment parenting, alternative technologies and construction, non-mainstream diet and hygiene, temperament theory, voluntary simplicity and an appreciation for the undomesticated aspects of life.

Once a week, we have a shared meal following our business meeting, both open to all visitors.

We are *always* seeking new community members. We're looking for adaptable, committed, hearty folks who respect the consensus process and seek interdependence.</description>

Pennine is a Camphill centre supporting a college for young people with learning difficulties.
Most co-workers live within the 56-acre site, working on a voluntary basis and receiving no wage or salary but with their daily needs being met by the community. We have recently extended the community and we are joined daily by others living locally. There is always an international flavour to the community, with usually half the co-workers coming from other countries, often as a gap year after or before college or university.
Our small farm and vegetable gardens are worked bio-dynamically and provide much of the community's needs. There are several craft workshops and a riding school run jointly with the Riding for Disabled Association.
We are always open to enquiries; our usual request is that a potential co-worker has a year free of commitments and would be prepared to live, work, and learn alongside others in the community. Many people come to help at the Pennine Community for about a year at a time. There are often places available, so please get in touch.

East Lake Commons is a cohousing community located five miles (eight minutes) from downtown Atlanta, and several miles southeast of the Little Five Points neighborhood. Completed in 2001, it includes 67 townhomes with 10 rental apartments attached, a 4500-sq-ft common house with classroom, office, playroom, media room, woodworking room, workout room, and guest rooms. A playing field and children's playground surround the common house. About half of the 20-acre site is dedicated to housing and parking on the perimeter; the remainder includes natural woodlands, wildlife corridor, and an organic garden with beehives, blueberry groves, shiitake mushroom logs, and a spring-fed pond. Homes are clustered around pedestrian courtyards and walkways.

Children can run and play with their friends in a safe and nurturing environment; teenagers have supportive role models; and seniors are actively integrated into the community. We are an intergenerational community with diverse religious, ethnic, cultural, and racial backgrounds, and differently abled. What binds us together is knowing and caring about our neighbors.

We manage the community ourselves using a consensus decision-making process. A backup voting procedure is also in place, with each owner getting two votes. Core community values include sustainability, visitability, diversity, affordability, and community.

Heartwood Ranch Cohousing, 350 acres in southwest Colorado (Durango / Bayfield area). Completed in 2000, and happily rolling into our 17th year!

Located twenty minutes east of Durango (and 3 miles NW of Bayfield), Heartwood Cohousing has 24 private homes on private lots, a large and beautiful Common House with open air terrace and &quot;Village Green&quot;, a separate workshop and greenhouse, all clustered snugly on 7 acres, surrounded by nearly 350 acres of community-owned woodlands and open space, including 50 acres of irrigated pastures and community gardens. 

We share our land with various numbers of chickens, turkeys, horses, cattle, pigs, and llamas, as well as the occasional black bear, bobcat, mountain lion, rattlesnake, elk, deer, waterfowl, eagles, hawks and many song and hummingbirds.

Residing at 7100 ft elevation, where the high red-rock deserts of the Four Corners region merge into the majestic, 13-14,000 ft San Juan Mountains – we thrive in one of Colorado's most stunning regions. We also typically enjoy 300 or more days of sun annually, so keep your sun-hat on!! 

While many of our residents work professionally, off-site, we also host multiple home-based businesses and associated resources that support a culture of personal and professional creativity and innovation, from back-to-the-land family farmers – to thriving 21st century web-based business successes.

Our resident population numbers have generally hovered around 70 individuals, with ages ranging from newborns and toddlers to well north of 70.  On-site home-schooling numbers have ebbed and flowed over the years; we also benefit from excellent local schools, with a variety of options to choose from.  And nearby Durango is host to Mercy Regional Medical Center, a state-of-the-art, acute care hospital and medical campus.

Presently, we have a limited number of ownership and rental opportunities; please visit our website to see what's available.

Whether your goals are the deep connection of community, dirt-under-the-fingernails home-grown simplicity, an active outdoor lifestyle that includes world-class hiking, road and mountain biking, skiing, kayaking and rafting, weekend trips to the desert or the high mountain wilderness, or an evening of excellent food and entertainment in nearby Durango...

Heartwood is the place to live, love, put down roots, raise your family, grow together, prosper and change the world, one neighborhood at a time. www.heartwoodcohousing.com  and   www.facebook.com/HeartwoodCohousing

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22490&quot;&gt;Cornerstone Village Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Urban Cohousing Community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/cornerstone-village-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/cornerstone-village-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
FROM OUR VISION STATEMENT

PURPOSE ~ We have come together to live in cohousing because we believe that people living in community live richer and happier lives. We value the cooperative process of operating our own community. In today's world, many neighborhoods do not serve the supportive function that they did in previous generations. An intentional, collaborative community can contribute to an individual's sense of belonging and their ability to contribute to the well-being of others and society as a whole.

FINANCIAL/LEGAL DESCRIPTION ~ Structured as a condominium all of our 32 units, ranging from one-bedroom apartments to 3 or 4-bedroom two-story apartments and townhouses, are owner-occupied. There are a few very rare rental opportunities, usually sharing a unit with others. All pricing is comparable to the standard Cambridge market.

PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION ~ We are located in a diverse neighborhood with easy access to public transportation, stores and open spaces such as the adjacent Linear Park, for both pedestrian and biking use. The community design maximizes open shared space, such as gardens and play space. A central common house offers room for shared dinners and other community activities. We also have two dens, an exercise room, arts &amp;amp; crafts room, and a kids' playroom.

ACCESSIBILITY ~ The community is fully visitable/accessible for mobility disabled persons, both residents and visitors.

COMMUNITY ~ Physical design encourages spontaneous interaction. Besides regular resident-prepared community meals, we create community through shared activities, work, play and joy. Learning and teaching of skills between members, especially across generations, is encouraged. Interdependence and mutual assistance are promoted as an integral part of daily life. Many of us are involved in the neighborhood as well as the wider community. We use the consensus as our mode of decision-making.

DIVERSITY ~ The community promotes cultural, racial and economic diversity through a broad outreach, the inclusion of affordable units and a welcoming attitude. We welcome families with children, singles, married couples, empty nesters and same-sex households.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY ~ Cohousing allows for a lighter, less consumer-oriented lifestyle. Economies of scale abound, including sharing of tools, child care, and guest rooms. We recycle, compost, conserve water and try to be as environmentally responsible as we can.

The community Elim provides for their own livelihood through full-time and part-time jobs, and consists right now of ten adults. Most of the income comes from the running of a technical illustration and design bureau, Bible Study Centre, and various jobs.

Community members live with a common purse, from which all costs are paid: rent, cars, holidays, pocket money, etc. From the circle of friends of the community, the evangelical church Elim came into being in 1985. This church has three meetings each week. One tries, both in the community and in the church, to put into practice living with God in everyday life. In addition, there are ongoing contacts with Christians in Third World countries—mainly India—both with western missionaries, and with native believers.

More than sixteen years ago, Elim initiated a community-movement of at present 35 Dutch communities. With our lives we hope people do discover that it is possible to live in peace and happiness through the life-giving and transforming power of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.

Founded in 1982, Agape is a lay Catholic nonviolent community dedicated to prayer, poverty, nonviolent education and ministry, and witnessing in the world. We are ecumenical and interfaith in orientation.
We accept volunteers for any length of time to work in our garden and assist with homesteading, including maintenance of our two buildings, St. Francis House and St. Brigid House (a straw bale house with solar energy and a composting toilet). We drive a car that runs on vegetable oil.
We welcome interns for stays of three months to a year. Currently, we are interested in a full commitment of nine months. We live on 32 acres of land in the Quabbin Reservoir in central Massachusetts.
We support ourselves through a nonviolent education ministry, donations and grants--which includes outreach to inner-city youths and adults--retreats, and other programs at the community. We host a variety of educational groups who are interested in sustainability. 
We pray together, study Scripture, and witness out of this base against all forms of violence.
We welcome people who have a yearning for a community life based on prayer, simplicity, and nonviolence. No TV or commercial radio but lots of music and a definite love of art in all its forms.
Those drawn to Agape will interact with hundreds of people throughout the year, including college students who attend Agape's twice-yearly retreats. Office work, computer assistance, gardening, homesteading of all kinds, and public witness and outreach are a part of our lives, as is contact with children.
Website: www.agapecommunity.org

We publish a community journal, Servant Song, and we are interested in the links between sustainability, the arts and spirituality, as well as in resistance to war through simple lifestyle.

Our work includes attending vigils for peace and joining in protests, as well as organizing around issues of resistance to violence. We do all of our resistance in the spirit of nonviolence. Contemplation and action are underpinnings of our lives.

We are also beginning a search for a long-term intern who would be able to commit to more than a year of time. We are looking for someone who has community experience, as well as an interest and a background in sustainability and nonviolence. Please contact us for more information if interested.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22495&quot;&gt;Berkeley Student Cooperative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The mission of the Berkeley Student Cooperative is to provide a quality, low-cost, cooperative housing community to university students, thereby providing an educational opportunity for students who might not otherwise be able to afford a university education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/berkeley-student-cooperative-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/berkeley-student-cooperative-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Founded in 1933, the Berkeley Student Cooperative (BSC) is the largest student housing cooperative in North America, housing over 1,200 people. Although a private nonprofit corporation, the BSC works in cooperation with the University of California to provide housing for its students.  

The mission of the Berkeley Student Cooperative is to provide a quality, low-cost, cooperative housing community to university students, thereby providing an educational opportunity for students who might not otherwise be able to afford a university education.  Membership is generally limited to full time students.  Most members attend UC Berkeley; however, the co-ops are open to full-time students at any college or university.

About 900 of the BSC's members live in room-and-board houses scattered around the Berkeley campus that each function as a separate cooperative household with elected managers for room assignment, work organization (housekeeping, food service, etc.), and maintenance. The other 300+ live in apartment complexes where members share 1-4 person apartments and take turns with grounds maintenance and recycling.  Food service is not provided by the co-op at the apartments.

Our Board of Directors is made up of students elected by each of our houses.  A central support staff of about 25 nonmembers provides technical information to members as well as oversees day-to-day administration (such as housekeeping applications and organizational financing). We also provide warehousing and support services to individual house food programs.  

Communities within the BSC include Andres Castro Arms, African American Theme House, Casa Zimbabwe, Cloyne Court (substance-free, academic theme), The Convent (Graduate &amp; Re-entry students), Davis, Euclid, Hillegass-Parker House (Graduate &amp; Re-entry students), Hoyt (Women only), Kidd, Kingman, Lothlorien (vegetarian), Ridge, Sherman (women only), Stebbins, Wilde (LGBTQIA &amp; Queer), Wolf, Fenwick, Rochdale, and Northside.  

The BSC also maintains an Alumni Association for former members to stay in touch and support the cooperative's mission.  www.bscaa.org</description>

      <name>Vegetarian Sanctuary - A Prepper Haven</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22496&quot;&gt;Vegetarian Sanctuary - A Prepper Haven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Living Food &amp; Energy Self-Reliant Lifestyles at this Prepper Haven, Vegetarianism, Cooperation, Education to the public&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/vegetarian-sanctuary-a-prepper-haven/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/vegetarian-sanctuary-a-prepper-haven/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We're Daniel and Patti EarthStewards, a vegetarian couple who have been long time Homesteaders, Preppers and Communitarians. We've lived a back-to-the-land food and energy self-reliant lifestyle since 1990, with a previous study of these lifestyles and preparations since the late 70's. 

We seek Co-Founders for a collectively run vegetarian Eco village and a Prepper Haven we'd like to call a Vegetarian Sanctuary. 

At Vegetarian Sanctuary our wish is to co-create with a unified voice and make enduring alliances. Our goals are to restore sustainable lifestyles, to live close to the land, and to teach the right use of our planets limited resources.

We realized years ago the importance of preparing for social, political, economic and environmental changes which are unfolding. Recently we felt it was time to organize a Prepper Haven on our farm located north of Spokane, WA.

The Hopi advice we tap into as a guide for this Haven can be read at: http://www.communityworks.info/hopi.htm

Especially significant to us are the questions the Hopi asked... 

&quot;What are you doing? What are your relationships? Are you in right relation? Where are you living? Where is your water?&quot; Also...&quot;Know your garden&quot;. 

We at Vegetarian Sanctuary have been asking ourselves the same type of questions since the late 1970's. We're as prepared as any intentional community could be to positively respond to these questions. 

Our intention with Vegetarian Sanctuary is to establish an embankment to grab hold of, where vegetarian Preppers of good will may gather together when the rivers of change are sweeping us all downstream. And like the Hopi advised, we're reaching out to see who would like to be there with us. 

We're serious about THRIVING in this time of uncertainty and have planned for the dollar collapse, earth changes and civil unrest. If you, like us, are feeling that weird vibe and sense something is coming, but you cannot put your finger on it, then you have met the right people to talk to about this at Vegetarian Sanctuary. We are doers, not talkers, and we want to be joined by those of like mind.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22497&quot;&gt;Network for a New Culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; communication, community building, personal growth, social change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/network-for-a-new-culture/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/network-for-a-new-culture/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Network for a New Culture (NFNC) is a non-land-based intentional community of several hundred people throughout the US, originally inspired in part by the ideals and goals of the ZEGG community in Germany. Our members are those who have experienced New Culture at an event, gathering, workshop, or at an intentional community based on New Culture, and choose to become part of our intense and intimate network.

NFNC sees community as a means to social change, and one of our goals is to encourage our members to establish communities which serve as models of healthy ways of relating to the Earth and to each other.  We see community as a means to produce a world without fear, violence, coercion, or sexual repression.  We believe that there are several key components to realizing this vision: self-responsible individuals; mutual support, honesty and openness in interpersonal relationships, a realization that means determine ends, and a realization that the personal is political — that is, a commitment to personal growth and change.

At present there are local NFNC groups in Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia,  Virginia, DC and Massachusetts; and there are intentional communities based on NFNC principles in Virginia, West Virginia, California, Hawaii, and Oregon.  To facilitate the community-forming and personal growth process, NFNC members hold conferences, workshops, and camps throughout the year.</description>

      <name>Acorn Community Farm</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22499&quot;&gt;Acorn Community Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Secular, Egalitarian, Anarchist, Autonomous, Sustainable, Cooperative, Non-Violent, Feminist, Intentional Community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/acorn-community-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/acorn-community-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Acorn is an intentional community of around 30 folks which was founded in 1993. We are an egalitarian, income-sharing, secular, anarchist, feminist, consensus-based commune. We are committed to non-coercive, voluntary associations within our community and the larger community in which we find ourselves as well as living sustainably, supporting queer &amp;amp; alternative lifestyles, and creating a vibrant, eclectic culture.

We live on a working farm which means there is always plenty to do. Everyone is expected to contribute 42 hours of labor a week. There are many types of work available, mostly for our farm and business. We grow herbs and food for our kitchen &amp;amp; seeds for our business, care for lots of livestock(chickens, cows, goats, &amp;amp; pigs!), cook two community meals daily, educate our children, maintain our land &amp;amp; buildings, and do office jobs like accounting, seed packing and order picking/shipping. We also do outreach work in our local community and in the communities movement, like growing food for our local food bank, and helping other communities and organizations like the FIC, the Federation of Egalitarian Communities, Organic Seed Alliance, &amp;amp; the Grassroots Seed Network. Members may also work outside jobs to fulfill their labor quota. All of this work is valued equally.

Because creditable labor is so diverse, we have more free time than the average working person. The community supports the education, personal growth, &amp;amp; personal projects of our members. We have no bosses, owners, investors, managers, or supervisors. We set our own schedules and trust members to work quota. We get things done by having a culture which stresses personal responsibility and good communication. We care about Acorn so we work hard to ensure it stays around.

Our thriving seed business, Southern Exposure Seed Exchange, is part of a growing network of farmers, gardeners and seed savers dedicated to organic and heritage agriculture. We sell heirloom, open-pollinated, non-GMO and organic seeds and do seed saving education and outreach. We earn our income by providing a means of production to gardeners and farmers.

We have 2 group meetings per week. One is a consensus-based decision making meeting while the other is a general discussion forum where we explore ideas &amp;amp; work through issues. We intentionally keep policies to a minimum. We encourage personal responsibility rather than supervision, as well as taking issues on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind that needs of individuals vary. Any decision we make can be brought back to a meeting at any point - our lifestyle thrives on open communication &amp;amp; respect for fellow communards.

Once every 2 years, members are required to take part in an interpersonal communication process called a &quot;clearness&quot;, where a single member talks individually to every other member about how they have been feeling, their relationship with the community, and what they envision their future to be. Membership visitors &amp;amp; long-term interns/guests are also required to have a clearness.

Remember, this stuff is hard! We share the daily challenges of living and working together, remembering to have fun while running a growing business, making decisions together, and sharing income. We are interested in meeting people experienced in community-building, communication and facilitation, who are interested in building a healthy, dynamic, supportive social culture.

If you are interested in visiting us, interning in our seed business and garden, or considering applying for membership, please visit our website, www.acorncommunity.org, and click on &quot;How to Visit Acorn Community Farm.&quot;

We look forward to hearing from you!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22500&quot;&gt;Ecoaldea Huehuecoyotl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Ecology and Arts Center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ecoaldea-huehuecoyotl/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ecoaldea-huehuecoyotl/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Huehuecoyotl is an ecovillage in the mountains of Tepoztlan, Mexico, founded by a group of adults and their children--artists, ecologists, artisans, and educators from seven different nationalities. The community was established at the present site in 1982. Over the years it has developed into an extended family; an experimental center; a model of rural, simple community living; and an important site where different traditions, cultures, and visions blend harmoniously with each other. There are low-cost guest facilities and extensive gardening as well as the use of renewable materials and sustainable designs for construction and water management.

Ideal communities exist only in the imagination of visionaries, but real communities are a long daily process of understanding, hard work, patience, and love. Our village reflects both the frustrations of not being able to materialize our ideals and also achievements that are beyond description in terms of solidarity, cooperation, harmony in diversity, and an example of an ecotopian vision since the early 1970s. 

We are now facing a new cycle of our growth, which implies moving into a more balanced relationship with our environment and with our collective cultural center, which is rapidly becoming an alternative educational center for new communities, the arts, networking, and the rights of Mother Earth. We try to bring together the best of all worlds, and we live a fairly happy life. Our members live in a combination of private and common property ownership. We each have our personal economy and contribute to the upkeep, maintenance, and improvement of the community through dues and income generated by our services to guests and groups. We offer training in leadership development, sustainable practices, health and healing, shamanism, and community design. All our members speak Spanish and English and some speak up to five additional languages. We are  caretakers of the Chichinautzin natural preserve, a protected forest that stretches for approximately 30 miles east and west of Huehuecoyotl.

We honor connectedness, sustainability, integrity, participation, creativity, and the sacred. We empower individuals to manifest their dreams to benefit themselves, Nyland and the greater community, with respect for our agreements and differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/nyland/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/nyland/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Nyland is a cohousing community of 42 private homes in a rural setting outside Boulder, Colorado, with an expansive view of the Rocky Mountains. Our community consists of approximately 140 residents with varied backgrounds, careers, ages, and views. Yet, we all share the same desire to live near neighbors we know in a small neighborhood. We offer each other support and friendship, while respecting our needs for privacy. Our common vision is a physically and emotionally safe community where children play on the pedways, neighbors lend each other a hand, and nature coexists peacefully in our open spaces.

Crystal Waters has been designed from inception according to the principles of permaculture by Max Lindegger, Robert Tap, Barry Goodman, and Geoff Young. It is a wildlife sanctuary where dogs and cats are banned and people really do try to live in harmony with nature. Eighty percent of the 640 acres are owned in common, and these are a mix of terrains: the clear waters of the Mary River, serene lakes, open grasslands, timbered hills and gullies, and, increasingly, pockets of rain-forest trees planted as part of the community's passion for reforestation. 
The idea was that people should be able to operate from home, and many businesses operate from here, e.g., foresters, mail-order businesses (books, organic gardening supplies), carpenters, builders, permaculture course providers and consultants, nurseries, caterers, craftspeople, architects, entertainers, a bakery, Village camping area with cabin and bunkhouse accommodations, commercial kitchen, spindle maker, therapists, beekeeper, and ecovillage designer.  Crystal Waters won an award in the 1996 World Habitat Awards and was a finalist in the 1998 Best Practices Awards. Many innovative ideas in building, wastewater, water, agriculture, and nature conservation are evident. The model has proved attractive to the relatively mainstream as well as an alternative market.  About 250 live now in the village.

To see that of God in everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/jesus-christians/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/jesus-christians/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
We have been operating as a community for more than 25 years.  Our community grew out of an experiment with literal obedience to the teachings of Jesus.  Although we don't fit into any neat category, we have often been referred to as Christian anarchists, and we practice what is considered to part of the gift economy.  We keenly support much that Leo Tolstoy wrote about the &quot;kingdom of heaven&quot;, and there is a strong resonance with early Quaker principles. 
Because we believe that attitudes toward money are fundamental in all human relationships, &quot;living in community&quot; for us includes &quot;common ownership&quot;.  No member of our community works for money, and we generally live a very frugal lifestyle.  We believe in the philosophy of doing all that we do for love and without a profit motive.  Many of our members are freegans, living largely off things that the rest of society throws away.
We are a mobile community, regularly on the move to preach the Word and nourish the Kingdom of God wherever, and in whomever, we find it.

Walker Creek, a 20-acre rural community near Mount Vernon, was established in 1979 to practice and promote organic farming, food self-reliance, energy efficiency, and non-polluting technologies. The stated purposes of Walker Creek include “assisting the growth of a new culture and society which incorporates the principles of human cooperation, personal growth, ecological awareness and the preservation of the natural beauty of this earth...”

Walker Creek Community retains about half of its 20 acres in woodland and protects a salmon-spawning creek. The rest of the land includes private gardens and homes, and communal roads, trails, lawns, orchards and play equipment. Each home contains an independent family, extended family, or individual. The adult population, usually about 10 people, meets monthly to share a meal and reach consensus on issues facing the community. At this time, there is no room for new members, but we are in the process of converting a barn into a community center/guest house.

Twin Oaks is an income-sharing community of 100 people living on 485 acres of farm and forestland in Virginia. We were founded in 1967, and our lifestyle reflects our values of egalitarianism, ecology, and nonviolence. We welcome scheduled visitors throughout the year. We are economically self-sufficient.

Members work in our community businesses--making hammocks and chairs, indexing books, and making tofu. These businesses provide about one-third of our work; the rest goes into the tasks needed to support a rural village of 100 people--organic gardening, milking cows, equipment and building maintenance, office work, and more. Our work schedules of 44 hours each week are very flexible. In return for member's labor, the community provides all basic needs, including housing, food, clothing, etc. Twin Oaks has an intricate community culture.

Our everyday lives include many recreational activities--social and support groups, performances, music, games, dance, and art. Our culture values tolerance of diversity and sustainable living. We share our vehicles, we build our own buildings, and we share houses of 10-20 people. Some of us work actively for peace and justice, ecology, and feminism. Each summer we host a Women's Gathering and a Communities Conference; see our website for details.

We offer a three-hour tour on many Saturday afternoons; please call during business hours or email to reserve a place. Our three-week visitor program is a prerequisite for membership and must be arranged by letter or email well in advance of the proposed stay. Information about visiting is available on our website or by mail.

Lots of good food we've grown, enjoyed together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/springtree-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/springtree-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are two married mid-age couples. Our commune (established in 1971) is on 120 rural acres. We share income, eat meals together, and organize work by preference. We are eclectic, independent, and frugal. While we are aging, this is not a retirement community. Our group goals are often expressed through work--gardening, orcharding, and tree planting; keeping chickens; firewood; and maintaining our two houses. We support ourselves with income from outside jobs, and engage in many area activities.

We intend to remain a small, close group and are not actively seeking members. We strive to keep the community flexible in meeting our changing needs for stability and adventure, individual activity, and group cohesiveness. We value commitment and compatibility.

Visitors are welcome by prior arrangement. In season, we can have apprentices for one to six months learning and practicing ecological gardening, community, and country-living skills. For more information, write and tell us about yourself.

Affordable housing
Diversity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/santa-rosa-creek-commons/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/santa-rosa-creek-commons/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;SRCC (Santa Rosa Creek Commons) is an established Limited Equity Housing Cooperative (LEHC) where everyone is a shareholder and  manager. We are located near downtown Santa Rosa, California. Our property includes 27 units in three 2-story apartment buildings and two older houses that have been divided into duplexes. As a cooperative, each household owns one share in the nonprofit corporation that owns the property. Members are considered owners, but rather than owning the unit occupied, members collectively own the whole property. Members purchase a share just prior to moving in and pay a regular monthly Carrying Charge that covers the mortgage, insurance, maintenance, water/sewer, garbage/recycling and overhead. All members form the Board of Directors. Decisions are made using a consensus process in which proposals are generated by committees and decided upon by the Board at a monthly meeting. Each member contributes at least 8 hours a month in labor, in addition to the Board meeting and two committee meetings. SRCC is self-managed, and we do as much of our own maintenance as we can. Social events include monthly potlucks, holiday parties, an annual 4th of July+SRCC Anniversary party, and other celebrations. Most of our community sits well off the street, nestled into a forest glen next to a year-round creek that runs through town. We are honored to have been referred to as a little piece of Walden in downtown Santa Rosa. Shops and restaurants in downtown Santa Rosa are just a short walk away, as are nearby services such as the main post office and library, government offices (including City Hall, state and federal buildings), and Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital.</description>

We are an intentional Christian community, associated with the Mennonite Church. Located in rural Illinois, we are part of Shalom Mission Communities, with involvement especially in Central America. We welcome those who acknowledge Jesus as Lord of their lives and wish to share in our life together as a part of discipleship.

Values of mutual respect, justice, compassion for the poor, fidelity in marriage, and pacifism form the core of our life together. Hospitality and being connected with other cultures through personal relationships are also important in our shared life.

Some of our members work at a variety of jobs in the larger community, while others help in the farming, growing fruits and vegetables using methods that are environmentally friendly.

As a church we have both communal and noncommunal members. The Fellowship is the communal part and has 10 adults and 2 kids. The noncommunal church members include 4 adults and 2 children. Another family living here is active, but has not chosen membership and another family moving here in the spring. (Numbers as of January 2014.)

The international Benedictine monastic order of sisters and brothers looks to Saint Benedict of Nursia, Italy, (480-547), the Patriarch of Western Monasticism, as its founder and inspiration. In the sixth century A.D., he wrote what we know as the Rule of Benedict or Regula Benedicti that continues to inspire and direct authentic Benedictine communities.

As stewards of this land, and members of our Cerro Gordo Cooperative, we share responsibility for fostering a community which is both life-enhancing and creates healthy, nurturing relationships with our natural surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/cerro-gordo-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/cerro-gordo-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
We are a dog-free community founded on ecological values, including organic land care &amp;amp; gardening.  We practice sustainable forestry on 1100+ acres.  Most of our forest land is in a Healthy Forests Reserve Program, and we're in the process of doing a conservation easement on most of the remaining land, which is largely oaks &amp;amp; meadows.  Our houses are clustered into two neighborhoods, surrounded by these forests and meadows, with many seasonal streams.  We operate as a Cooperative, sharing maintenance of the water systems &amp;amp; roads.  Please note: in accordance with our state/county zoning agreements, dogs cannot live here (and we love it that way).
Note: if you contact us by phone, you reach one person here; if you contact us by email, you reach a different person here.

Our intergenerational community will form on the six cohousing principles:  (1) Participatory Process,  (2) Neighborhood Design,  (3) Common Facilities,  (4) Resident Management,  (5) Non-hierarchical structure and decision-making, and  (6) No shared community economy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/marincohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/marincohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Marincoho.com

About Us…

Design workshops kick off Febrary 2018! First...Site Programming.  We're here, at last.

Novato Cohousing Now is a core group, ten households of active adults and families, has been meeting regularly to make sustainable, intergenerational cohousing a reality in Marin.

We've learned a great deal about site availability and cost models, and have teamed with CoHousing Solutions to move forward. We have our target site and kicked off our credibility phase with a Getting It Built Workshop on March 12 &amp;amp; 13, 2016.  

Early Beginnings…

John Caye and Judy Slater are project co-founders. They met on the last day of the National Cohousing Conference in Durham in May 2015. They discovered they lived three blocks from each other and were eyeing the same property. Ever since then, they've met regularly to dream, scheme and plan the perfect cohousing community for Marin, gathering additional committed members along the way.

Cohousing development dovetails nicely into both their ambitions. John is a graduate of the Katie McCamant's 500 Communities Program launched by CoHousing Solutions, and Judy is fulfilling her Leader Quest through her Coaches Training Institute's Leadership Program.

Judy made a list of all the qualities she wanted in a co-leader and John had them all (and still wants to know what they are!). John calls Judy his instigator and together, he plans and manages the site and financial aspects of the project while she works to promote cohousing to local government officials, coordinate the social dynamics of group building and keep the project moving forward.</description>

We apply this commitment to our environment, society, economy, and all other relationships.[1]

~While focusing on education, we endeavor to become a productive, successful example, of living in harmony with ourselves, our fellow humans and our Earth Mother.~&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/forming-need-founders/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/forming-need-founders/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;**We're looking for a few one-of-a-kind, super founders, very specific folks.

Our community is forming, although some of our information is written in present tense. Please keep in mind- there is no land and no infrastructure yet!  

This is the original visioning document. It is simply a summary of what we hope and dream our community to look like in the nearest possible future. It's our goal. The actual details and systems are laid out in other documents.

Return of the Tribes-

Sometimes when I close my eyes, I'm taken to another place, another time. I'm writing this down once more as a map of my journey. This is a place of Peace and Joy, a time of Love and Happiness. Here there is an abundance of Life, fields of green and amber flourishing with grain, fruit and vegetables. Healthy, vibrant forests wrap around a beautiful, clean river valley. The scents of wildflowers and fragrant herbs bathe the senses. The sounds of children’s’ laughter and people singing and drumming as they tend the fields carry on the wind. As you come closer, as if drawn in by magnetic attraction, you see cabins, cottages, greenhouses and earthshelters dotting the countryside, encircling the fields and pastures. People smile warmly, welcoming you home. This is Tribe, this is Community, this is The Garden- our true home, where we belong.

As you wander down a small road, winding its way past family dwellings and farm buildings, there stand wind turbines, a wood gasifier and solar panels harnessing natural energy in a natural way. Everywhere can be seen people happily going about the day. You see the Building Crew, creating a new home for one of the families off to the East. Over there you notice a group of children leading their teacher on a class excursion tracing the edge of the forest, tracking animals and exploring plants. Ahead you see the Permaculture Crew planting seeds for the future and a group tending to the various farm animals. There are children everywhere as the road winds closer to the community's center. The children here attend a school taught by various community people for a few hours a day. Another lesson is spent visiting the different crews in their daily rounds, whether it be the Food prep.Crew, the Farm Animals Crew or another. This way each child gets real-life exposure and interaction with every part of life, as well as plenty of time to play and explore.

Continuing down the road following the smells of fresh-baked bread and cooking food, you approach a large dome shaped building, looking as if it is pulsing with Life; and it is. This is the Community Lodge, housing the Central Fire. Here, meals are served each day, prepared by the Food Prep Crew in the adjacent community kitchen. This is also a gathering place for meetings, ceremonies and entertainment. Elders tell stories, music is performed and children act out plays. By celebrating the many facets of Wholistic Tribal Living, the people hold this place dear to their hearts.

The people are truly happy here because they live the way humans were created and evolved to live. Conflicts are resolved peaceably by a dynamic communication the people here strive for. Everyone chooses their own type of service to the community, according to their skills and talents. Some are teachers, some are healers. Some work the fields or the kitchen. Some are builders, artists or craftsmen. All are needed integrally and equally. Many tools and crafts are produced in the community- boots and footwear, felt hats and gloves, rustic furniture, pottery, clothing, hand tools, the list goes on. These items are then distributed throughout the community to whoever has need of them. Any surplus is traded with the sister communities for things they produce-food items, tools or specialties.

Since each community is &quot;self-sufficient&quot;(but actually co-dependant upon sister tribes) they produce all the whole, natural foods necessary to support the community. Permaculture principles are employed to organically grow vegetables, sprouts, grains, nuts, fruit, meat, fish, eggs, milk, yogurt, cheese, honey, herbs, etc. The storehouses are full and excess is used to barter.

Walking down a small trail weaving through the woods, you come upon a serene lake. Nestled in on its shore is a beautifully landscaped building, blending naturally in harmony with the surroundings. This is the Healing Center. Many forms of healing are practiced here, from various types of massage and acupuncture to herbals and emergency medicine. Community people are treated freely by community people, since each contribute to the Whole Tribe. Each has their own skill or passion to offer the Whole. Everyone is fed good whole healthy food, everyone is educated well, everyone is healed, and everyone is both benefited and benefits others. We are one. Also, each Community Tribe specializes in certain areas of skill or knowledge, and therefore functions as a learning center, a living university of sorts. People are free to travel back and forth between sister Communities, seeking out new learning and teaching experiences.

You may wonder how order is maintained and who makes the decisions. The people themselves make the decisions through the respective councils. For example, the Permaculture/Aquaponic Crew decides when, where, and how to plant, tend and harvest the fields and greenhouses. The Education Council organizes the schooling of the children. The people who make up these councils and crews are composed of anyone who feels drawn to them. These and other crews work together closely with the Council of Elders, the main facilitating body. These elders are exemplary people in the community, noted for their wisdom and ability to put the good of the whole above their own. They guide the tribe to come to decisions on all pertinent issues. In this way order is maintained and each voice is respected and honored.

Because actual goods and services are produced here, money is (eventually becomes) meaningless in this barter system. An extensive trade network exists between the sister communities with outreach busses navigating back and forth, on a constant circuit, picking up and discharging people and trading goods while teaching classes and workshops across the country. There are many community outreach services provided to include the searching public in the nearby big cities- a community run natural cafe, community store offering the many crafts and products made by the tribe and a school offering many classes and workshops. At this community, there are provisions for guests and visitors to stay and a trial period for longer. Reaching out rather than isolation is our goal, living by example and lending a helping hand to the masses.

All the people here know that it is not enough to just have a &quot;spiritual&quot; community; brothers and sisters just a meditation or a phone call away. Rather, True Community, Wholistic Community must exist on all levels equally, INCLUDING THE PHYSICAL!!! The physical aspects of Wholistic Community are all about living cooperatively and in harmony with children, young people, adults and Elders. They also include taking part in and understanding all of the processes that support physical life and health! Some of the more critical examples are:
Planting, tending, harvesting and preparing living, growing plants.

Preparing, storing and cooking naturally organic, whole &amp; healthy foods.

Building naturally energy efficient homes.

Harnessing Naturally pure energy in a natural way.

Birthing, raising, lovingly caring for food animals.

Caretaking the Earth while gathering and harvesting needed materials.

Hunting, fishing and wild crafting/gathering when necessary, in a balanced,sacred manner, as has sustained all natural tribal cultures close to the Earth Mother for eons.

The list goes on. Without these interactive processes, true community cannot exist in its fullest state of teaching life's most important lessons and passing them on to the next generation. True community is WHOLISTIC and has many integral support systems that are inextricably bound together, mimicking the balance of Nature. As in Nature, take one piece away, and the Whole eventually collapses. The people here know this, they live it, the people here remember what life is really about.</description>

Our purpose is to construct real solutions by providing the support, space, and resources to do so via our collective knowledge and common heritage of the Earth's resources.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-transition-headquarters/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-transition-headquarters/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;You never change things by fighting the existing reality.
To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.
― Richard Buckminster Fuller

We believe in living life well and making better choices. That means avoiding choices that lead to negative impacts that are harmful to ourselves and our environment. Instead we seek out sustainable methods for living and integrate them in our model for social change. Society is transforming and maturing, moving towards an era of more collaboration, connection and contribution. Together our aim is to perpetuate and expand a society based on on these values.

The Transition is not a revolution, it is an evolution. It brings some of the techniques and principles of Communalism into action while using the existing monetary system rules and influences it cannot readily escape.  We are not fighting against the current system. We are adapting the current system so that it can transform into something better that would enable all of us to achieve a much higher standard of living within a relatively short period of time; a standard of living that would be continuously improved as we develop our technologies and the ways in which these discoveries are implemented. Rather than isolating ourselves completely from the mainstream, we promote The Transition as a viable alternative. The Transition is a communal organization striving for an egalitarian global society built on ephemeralization principles. Our intention is to bring together those who follow a compass set with the same values so we can reach our mutual goals faster. If you have land or are a community looking for dedicated people with a lot of passion we would love to talk with you!</description>

And share perhaps the wish to live in north europe summers and winters south.

In order to set up -and live,
life, work in- an ecological village together. there are convergences we organise in holland and (austria in the future) 

We are looking to start with 1-2 extra persons, next summer in austria.

for the south europe part (winters)


We are still in the initial phase and think that at this point it is essential that the group expands. 

3-6 are enough first to set up an ecological community (and later perhaps it could be in a network a ecovillage. 
working together with surrounding projects.

For this we are making a tour in february 2016 around 5-10 (nomad) bases in north and central portugal

Join us, the greater the chance will be that our dreams will come true!

We are Spiritual but Not religious. Please indicate how you are willing to contribute to ZION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/thefuturenow/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/thefuturenow/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I have decided to change the dynamic of the community. I have 40 acres in Helena, Montana
I am seeking 5-10 people who can contribute $25K-$50K to the development of the property.
This would be for creating dome housing, planting fruit tree orchards and a greenhouse and more.

The funding received will get you a spot on the land, fresh clean water, fruit in season and 
all the other amenities. The land is mostly raw so this would get you in on ground level and you would
be a part of the initial creative process. 

Please feel free to call me 406-949-0231

Most of our food, shelter, heat, and water come from the surrounding land to a greater extent than is possible anywhere in the Lower 48.

After a mutual trial period of 2-12 months, we are offering 1-2 acre fifty year leases for one dollar per year, plus free lumber and use of tools with which to build a house. Our belief is that small scale cooperative living in the natural world is a happier, healthier, and ecologically saner alternative to the industrial/consumer society.

We are located on 48 private, wooded and very beautiful acres, just two miles from downtown Nevada City, California.  We have several residence cabins, a common house with shared facilities &amp;amp; gathering space, a large garden, hiking trails, swimming pond, and an art &amp;amp; workshop space.  There are also future plans for an indoor spa/hot-tub sanctuary, a carport housing a solar electric system, and additional living structures. 

We are open to creative souls of many types: writers, musicians, photographers, filmmakers, dancers, painters, sculptors, potters, thespians, craftspeople, even organic garden designers, alternative builders . . . people who have one or more creative passions that they generally practice on a regular basis.

We have the common goal of cultivating personal growth and vitality through healthy and clean living which would include cooperative communication and decision making, an absence of substance or media dependence, aesthetic individual and group environments, and holding a compassionate and supportive mindset.

Our intention is to form into a close, yet individually autonomous group - developing common grounds, a common house with shared facilities, shared studio and workshop spaces, special gatherings and collective projects; combined with individual housing, independent personal economics, independent spiritual persuasions and the like. 

We consciously acknowledge the creative process as a vehicle towards enhanced sapience, specifically the development of heightened perception, sensitivity, intuition, insight and innovation. We recognize that inspiration derived from practicing the expressive arts promotes deepened interpersonal commonalities as well as physical, mental and emotional health.  Our primary goal is to both model and practice a lifestyle where fostering our personal creative spirit, especially in the context of an on-site, supportive, like-minded group, encourages growth in our natural aptitude, social connection and holistic well-being.

Along with several residential cabins opening late fall 2018, we currently have an opening for a caretaker.  Caretaker duties would include maintenance of structures (handy-man tasks), landscaping, trail work, house cleaning and ongoing land and building security checks.  Some tasks might also include some pond work, garden work, and care of livestock.  Rent for the private caretaker's cabin can be compensated by 8+ hours work per week for someone with professional skill &amp;amp; seasoned experience; or 12+ hours for a semi-skilled worker.  The Caretaker would contribute $200 per month to the Community Fund (ask about how to receive 50% discount!), and they would contribute to common utilities and cover personal utilities for their dwelling.  

All prospective and current members participate in &quot;Compassionate Communication&quot; training sessions, and are aligned with the  Ingenium vision as outlined in the &quot;Knowing More About Our Vision&quot; page on our website, http://www.expressiveartsvillage.com/more-about-our-vision</description>

Piedras Blancas Preserve
Food and Water Secuirty
500 acres of off-the-grid paradise located at the foot of the Piedras Blancas Rainforest Preserve in the Southern Pacific region of Costa Rica. We are a farming community and all residents are “shareholders” in a working farm managed by a non-profit university teaching Sustainable Science. With a goal of food and water security, minimalist living, and international cross cultural experience Huella Pequena (“Small Footprint” pronounced HooWAYya PayKAYnya in Spanish) offers a low-cost, affordable, Earth-friendly alternative to the typical Gringo Western-copy of the dead-end housing development.  

Primary Rainforest
The Costa Rican government has bought up all the land in and around the Piedras Blancas National Park in order to protect forever the Rainforest from development and we have one of the few private properties left in the entire region. Surrounding approximately 125 of farmland is our 375 acres of Primary forest, meaning it consists of never-have-been cut forest filled with Jaguars, White faced monkeys, Howler monkeys, Toucans, Amazon parrots and a host of other tropical birds and mammals, super rare!

Rio Esquinas River
The property fronts the Rio Esquinas river, a clean fresh water river that flows from the highlands of the Piedras Blancas preserve and we also have  beaches on the Golfo Dulce which National Geographic says is a worldwide phenomena of incredibly deep waters famous for fishing and a only short boat ride from the historic French Banana town of Golfito and the other amazing national parks like Corcovado.  see this link https://www.google.com/maps/@8.7139355,-83.3191136,2459m/data=!3m1!1e3</description>

Residents of the Treasure Valley collaborate to manifest a sustainable community, sustainable business incubator, and education center in an urban setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/boise-ecovillage-project/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/boise-ecovillage-project/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The community is forming online, among friends, through word of mouth outreach events.   We are a Facebook group of 650+ members with a wealth of skills, talents and abilities. Our core group is three LLC members with 6 new applicants this last month.  We are about to finalize our operating agreements, membership agreements, principles and guidelines, as a member managed organization using dynamic self-governance.  We currently have 7 Village Circles.  We are leasing 3.5 acres where we are building relationships, hosting events, planting gardens and creating community space.  We are still keeping our eye out for land, although we are drawn to a geothermal property in Buhl that is on the market.  We are exploring options for financing the project, crowdfunding, community supporters, and loans.  Our community welcomes diversity, including socioeconomic status.  We are currently made up of families and people of all ages.  We have urban farmers, permaculturalists, horticulturists, homesteaders, builders, teachers, healers, a fabulous attorney, musicians and artists.  We have already begun to host workshops, retreats, events, conferences and festivals.  We would like to be a model of sustainable living, and teach these skills at an education center.  For this reason we want to be accessible and integrated into our larger community.  We have chosen Dynamic Self Governance (Sociocracy) as our governance model, after reading &quot;We the People: Consenting to a Deeper Democracy.&quot;</description>

The Catholic Worker Movement lives the vision of Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin, who believed that a peaceable revolution would result if people imitated Jesus Christ’s nonviolence (Matt 5:38-48), voluntary poverty (Matt 6:24, 19:16-26), and radical hospitality (Matt 25:31-46).  The BCR/CW is an ecumenical Christian intentional community that tries to live, pray and work with each other.  We offer housing, food, and love to people facing homelessness.  The BCR/CW is autonomous and has no institutional connection to the Roman Catholic Church.  We are not a 501c3 and donations are not tax-deductible.  We perform the works of mercy and nonviolently oppose the works of war.  We strive to practice the Sermon on the Mount, community living, voluntary poverty, personalism, and care for children and the environment.</description>

There are currently 11 people living here, and we are in the process of acquiring a third house which will increase our population capacity to 17, and then to build 4 additional bedrooms beyond that.

We have a fully collectivized food system with the understanding that anyone can come eat here, we share most household expenses, and a subset of us operate as a fully income sharing group.

We support each other as parents, believe children should be treated like humans, and humans should be treated well. Many of us co-parent each other's kids and we generally believe children to be the responsibility of the group.

We love welcoming guests. Many people think of The Mothership as home base and stop in to refuel, gather supplies, and plan new expeditions.

We are committed to clear, direct, and open communication, which we maintain with regularly scheduled (twice a year with each member of the house) one on one conversations and more one on one, small group, and whole community discussions on an as-needed basis. We encourage communication early and often, and we endeavor to avoid having unresolved interpersonal struggles that lead to a toxic living environment. If you've upset someone at The Mothership, you either already know about it or are about to.

We acknowledge having been raised in a culture that teaches racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, gender essentialism, ableism, body shaming, slut shaming, and the enforcement of gender roles and stereotypes. When these things inevitably fall out of our mouths, we are committed to talking about why they were problematic and how we can do better in the future.

We aspire to be a safe space for the marginalized. We have cultivated a culture that feels safe and comfortable for many queer, non-binary, and transgender people, as evidenced by our current demographics: we are over 70% LGBTQIA. Two of our eleven current members are people of color, one of whom brought forward a vision of using the large number of living spaces opening up to create a culture where people of color feel similarly safe and at ease in their homes. We are collectively working toward that dream.</description>

The Alliance of Intentional Communities Australia (AICA) is an independent, not-for-profit association established to bring together and assist individuals and groups in their pursuit of developing fulfilling, sustainable lives within and supported by the wider community.
We believe this vision can be achieved through intentional communities (IC) which accept that all living things are connected. These IC co-create healthy environments, practicing the values of caring, respecting, cooperation, taking responsibility and encouraging the highest human potential. They are examples of how we can contribute to improving the health of our world.
Description
Our aim is to share information on successful intentional communities and explore alternatives to find more harmonious ways in satisfying human needs through achieving a balance between the physical, spiritual and the environment. To foster existing and create built environments which provides for our basic needs such as food and shared resources in a way that enhances the health and well-being of the natural environment and the community through an optimised work-life balance. We aim to enhance existing and co-create much needed spaces within the metropolitan area that will contribute towards enhancing energy for ourselves, others and the planet.
- AICA will be supporting communities that aims to live in balance with our planet.
Our non for profit group consists of those who are passionate, motivated, ready and have the expertise and connections to participate in the visioning, planning, building and celebration of these communities.
As a group we will consciously support the creation and manifesting of preferred lifestyles based on satisfying our human needs in a manner that reflects our responsibilities as stewardship partners with all of creation on this planet.
We welcome those who share these beliefs and feel that they would like to get actively involved in the projects that are forming in Adelaide and surrounding area.

We wish to establish a self-reliant community of like-minded people, growing together spiritually, while protecting our environment.

We have 50 acres of land in a woody rural area, which we are currently preparing for settlement.

We are establishing ourselves slowly on the land.  Everything takes longer than expected.  We hope to start building the first house in 2019.  We are off-grid, and the house will eventually rely on solar power and rain water.  This house will be the start of a larger effort to establish a permanent community living our values.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22537&quot;&gt;Noldorath Forest Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Live and work in Nature, in harmony with Nature and each other.  Personal responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/noldorath-forest-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/noldorath-forest-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Intro.  I am willing to share my 20 ha of old growth forested land with others like minded.  People who wish to live and work in native forest, to work with Nature (no poisons, no bulldozing), to work to make this forest a delightful and supportive place for people live in,  to build a sense of community, and to cultivate a spiritual practice supportive of these important things.
My community proposal is for people without capital to buy and develop land.

Accommodation.  Live outdoors,  in the forest, using tarp roofs (details under “Housing”)

Principles : No drugs no alcohol. Keep the forest unburnt.  This means  :   RAKE and maintain the perimeter firebreak and no unsafe fires. Develop the organic vegie garden and orchard.   Share costs like – land rates, diesel to shops, tools, phone and internet. 

Aspirations : cultivate good relationships with others, relying partly on sharing spiritual and healing practices. Meet to share music, meditation, healthy shared meals, therapeutic massage, Tai Chi, perhaps even co-counselling.

Spiritual Practice.  Learn forest meditation to reconnect with the Ancient Mother, cultivate contentment, appreciation and joyfulness, and cultivate Presence and Being as Eckhart Tolle uses these words.  Work with Presence and without rush. Practice “mindfulness” in the Buddhist sense.  Integrate spiritual practice with healing.  Study spiritual writings relevant to these objectives.  Campfires at night instead of electronic screen entertainment.

      <name>Morningland Monastery</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22540&quot;&gt;Morningland Monastery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The focus of our community is to maintain a sanctuary for the practice of Maha-Anu-Ati-Yoga. This practice unites body, mind and spirit in seva: devotional service performed by serving our community with repurposed food and goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/morningland-monastery/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/morningland-monastery/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;COMMUNITY DESCRIPTION: Morningland Monastery is a non-residential lay-monastery and spiritual community formed around the teachings of our guru, Sri Donato. Founded in 1973, we are an offline urban community that maintains a sanctuary of Healing, peace and meditation for the purpose of practicing Maha-Anu-Ati-Yoga, which is a Kundalini path. The Kundalini, the light of God in all people, is raised through the Shaktipat of Sri Donato through her spiritual successors, the Gopis. The Gopis are a monastic order of women who run the Monastery. Maha-Anu-Ati-Yoga is a practice deeply rooted in both Eastern and Western dharma teachings on devotional service as a spiritual practice. Seva, selfless service, is the cornerstone of our community and is accessible to all. Our core principles are non-violence, mindfulness and seva. Our seva is to feed our local community and surrounding city with repurposed food, goods and spiritual services. Each month, we feed hundreds of people. Most of our members maintain professional and family lives, and attend in the evening and weekend. Due to our urban location, members maintain private, small group residences. 
We do not maintain an internet presence and rely on word-of-mouth. Nor do we keep digital records about visitors and members; we are digitally unplugged in this regard. At a time when so much work and life require being online or on a computer, we think it’s  refreshing to take a break now and then. Our sanctuary is a place to do this.
Our dharma tradition acknowledges and builds on the essential truths of esoteric Christianity, Yoga, and Buddhism. Our tradition is indigenous to Morningland Monastery. Our teachers, the Gopis, provide instruction in spiritual practice for self-realization that is sustainable in a busy modern life, and workable in a diversity of lifestyles.
Year round, we offer classes in meditation and yogic practices. Visitors are welcome to attend our weekly Dharma Talk where the ceremony of Shaktipat is takes place monthly.</description>

Open for residence since March, 2016, in 41 units built with universal design principles, Phoenix Commons was the vision for aging well in community of Chris Zimmerman and Lauren Zimmerman Cook, co-founders of Elder Village Development.

We the members of this intentional community are learning on the job the principles of participation, collaboration and consensus decision-making while working together and through committees to address community needs and concerns in such areas as wellness promotion, facility and common space management, finance, governance, landscaping, social and community engagement, and twice-weekly common meals.

Our members come from a wide variety of backgrounds and geographies, contributing their skills and talents to create a dynamic and socially engaged community. They have various reasons for choosing to live here, in community with others, as we age in place together. Many of our members still work full-time while others are active in a variety of recreational, cultural social, civic and political advocacy activities. All are committed to building and sustaining our community and the social connectedness that has been associated with health and well-being in older adulthood.</description>

We look forward to many discoveries and course corrections, and plan to do this with healthy consensus, growing grace and good humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/quimper-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/quimper-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;A senior cohousing condominium development - for ages 55+;  We will built as greenly as we could afford.

We began living together in October 2017.</description>

Home also to a large vegetable and fruit garden, chickens, a growing apiary and fruit orchard, inhabitants of the Ranch are encouraged to participate in homesteading activities such as growing and preserving harvest, cooking meals from scratch, crafting everything from condiments to health and beauty products to household cleaning products.  Whatever products of interest which can be bought in a store, we endeavor to create at home from basic household ingredients.  At the level each person is able to contribute around lives otherwise full with work and/or school, we like to dabble in DIY projects to save money, vote with our dollars, and be empowered to meet our basic needs.</description>

It had not been farmed for over a decade, and was partially reclaimed by forest when we arrived, in 1980. Two of us have been here since then, one was born here, and the most recent member began visiting in 2013.
A family friend owns an adjoining 200 forested acres and a conventional house, both of which are available to the community. 
This farm began as a diversified, organic, draft horse- powered farm, growing up to 20 acres of various grains per year and making loose hay out of another (partially pastured) 60 acres. Gradually our focus shifted in the direction of hand tools, and in 1998 we sold the last draft horses. Eventually, promoting the use of the scythe (see scytheconnection.com as a reference) became the primary mission; farming activity was curtailed and livestock were significantly reduced.  The chainsaw and tractor came into use, as well as the telephone and computer. The scythe project is still a major focus, but in the past few years attention to the farm has been increasing. Presently we have a flock of sheep, a few goats, milking cows, mammoth donkeys, chickens and honeybees. 
The principles of permaculture and deep ecology, along with an array of similar philosophies, were and remain the foundation of our quest as how exactly to live so far as physical existence is concerned. 
We believe that close coexistence, interdependence and trust are to be essential ingredients of conduct during the next stage of humanity's journey. We are particularly inspired by the concept and practice of the Longo Mai communities, and have recently begun looking into becoming part of the Longo Mai cooperative.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22549&quot;&gt;Familia Feliz (ESP1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; One main mission is to create a contemporary version of community structure, which implies sustainability, international exchange (we speak Spanish, English, German, French) and socio-cultural projects like our colour garden (featured by UNESCO) and several activities around art. The focus also is on establishing ways of self-supply (bio garden, fruit farming).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/familiafeliz-esp1/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/familiafeliz-esp1/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Familia Feliz is a decentralized living community with shared economy. Decentralized means those people live together who want to do so. The community does not dictate where a member should live or that all members have to live in one place at all times. Instead, it is part of the concept of Familia Feliz to live in different countries and different places. We start in Spain and Germany as these are the countries we already live and call our homes. Our community life is based on a shared economy, decisions by consensus, veto for each and solidarity with each member.  We respect and develop private property and focus on life in peace and freedom.

Familia Feliz is organized in units. A unit can be a working unit like &quot;bio garden&quot;  or a company run by members, as well as a a home unit, a group of members living in one house.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22550&quot;&gt;Broomgrass - an organic farm community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The philosophy and mission of Broomgrass is to preserve the Farm while developing an alternative rural community centered on organic farming, the preservation of wildlife habitats, and recreational opportunities that are not invasive to the environment. By providing a naturalistic setting and low density alternative solution to the development of rural farmland, the Broomgrass community endeavors to live with less impact on the earth and to protect the earth for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/broomgrass-an-organic-farm-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/broomgrass-an-organic-farm-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Broomgrass is a conservation based farm community, located in Berkeley County, West Virginia.  16 one-acre homesites were subdivided in clusters of three or four in a manner that preserves the farm fields and woodlands. Your purchase of a residential lot includes in your deed a membership in the association which owns the common land and amenities (barn, tractor, pool, pool house).

Broomgrass has been designed in a manner that seeks a balance between Man’s consuming lifestyle and the natural world. Design guidelines require homes to be energy efficient. Smarter water treatment systems eliminate subsurface water contamination. Progressive farming strategies enrich, rather than deplete, the soils. All of these combined tactics will perpetuate a healthy life at Broomgrass.</description>

Creature Conduit Sanctuary will be a fairly complex ecovillage for artists of all disclipines.

Some highlights...

Growing food all year with climate controlled aquaponics greenhouses (meaning we'll grow both food and fish without the use of fertiliser or chemicals).

Also growing food by way of food forest and hugelkultur walls.

Disaster-resistant, energy-efficient dome-shaped structures (can't be blown away, washed away, or burned. Can even survive earthquakes to an extent - can't do much about it if the ground opens beneath it).

The use of natural energy (solar, zero-point), rainwater collection, grey-water plumbing &amp; filtration.

Private residences, each with a greenhouse, with private bedrooms for each resident. A bathroom to each bedroom (with incinerating toilets - no composting, just ash). Free of monetary cost for each resident - instead, residents pay by working six hours each week to help keep the village operational. Residents will also be paid in the village currency for those six hours.

Village will support every art, including engineers and software developers.</description>

Farming. Food. Family. Community. Integrity. A simple, cooperative, regenerative life.

vision:

We are a farm-based intentional community where food and friends are central to healthy families and vibrant community life. We work together and with nature to enjoy an abundant yet simple existence. 

We cooperate in raising our young people close to the earth and with keen self, social, ecological, political, and economic awareness.

We create our own &quot;social security&quot; through strong and lasting interpersonal relationships built on healthy communication, trust, and mutual growth and support.

We empower ourselves and others to create positive change in the world.

We serve as a model of a gentle, regenerative, and successful way to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/full-creeks-collective/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/full-creeks-collective/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;At present Full Creeks Collective (FCC) is only our family: a married couple and our two young boys, 7 and two and 4 years old. We hope to grow to have from four the ten households (FCC is welcoming of all people, regardless of race, religion, gender orientation, age, marital/ family status, national origin, physical or mental ability, or political affiliation).

The land consists of 105 acres total, 25 acres of forest (including sugar maples), about 20 acres of wetland, 30 acres of pasture/ hayfield of which three are deer fenced for vegetables, and the remainder in a brushy wild rose vegetation that we are slowly converting to pasture. to us it is a magical place bursting with potential!

We welcome any and all farming or homesteading skills. We hope to attract people that would like to create small land-based businesses, but also embrace folks who would work jobs off-farm, or do both.

We are looking for long-term members who can give true commitment to the land and the people, who can commit to the processes of healthy communication and community meetings required for a healthy and functional community, and who want to become equal owners of the land over time. At present, there is very limited housing; anyone seeking to join long-term would need to vision home building as part of their future, preferably green built and off the grid.

FCC is home to Giving Ground Farm (GGF), our small family farm that we began in 2012. You could start your own land based businesses, or you could become part of GGF. GGF markets vegetables at the Trumansburg Farmers Market, and also has FULL membership in the Ithaca Farmers Market (it takes time to achieve this status at this very popular market). We have a small herd of rare, triple-purpose, heritage breed cattle, American Milking Devons, we are raising heritage breed pigs, and have a small fifty tree orchard. 

Some of our aspirations for the land and community include green built homes, permaculture gardens, solar, wind, and animal power, some form of outdoor education (the many ecosystems present are perfect for it!), more fruit and nut orchards, maple syrup production, raising our own eggs, meat, dairy, fruits and vegetables. Above all, we hope to create a tight knit community of people that truly care for one another and share in life's joys, sorrows, meals, work, play, and more...

FCC is located four miles due west of the pleasant small town of Trumansburg NY (coffee shop, natural food store, library, post office, restaurants, shops) and just 15 miles from progressive Ithaca NY that houses Cornell University and Ithaca College.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22556&quot;&gt;Enriched Earth Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To build an inspirational Educational Eco Village in Northern Ireland on the principals of sustainable living.

To lead, demonstrate and spread environmental innovation.

To promote community development for social change.

To develop a practical renewal of traditional culture and heritage for the times we live in and for the times to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-cauldron-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-cauldron-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Enriched Earth Ecovillage is an exciting project aspiring to create a pioneering and educational Ecovillage in Northern Ireland. For residents, guests, the local community, nationally and internationally we seek to become an inspiring example of best practice in sustainable living. We are registered as a not-for-profit Community Interest Company and intend to run series of cooperatives and other social enterprises within this legal framework.

Our Vision

A co-housing scheme, incorporating a community centre, shared facilities and social areas
Eco-education facilities and activities
Renewable energy technologies
Community allotments
Facilities and support for small business enterprises
Community festivals and events
Facilities for visitors and eco-tourists

Our Values

Exemplify best practice for sustainable living
Promote social inclusion and integration
Promote culture and heritage
Seek ecological, social and economic sustainability
Lead, demonstrate and spread environmental innovation
Promote community development for social change and peace and reconciliation
Provide for life long learning
Devise and adopt appropriate legal structures so as to facilitate and co-ordinate the development of the overall enterprise.

Enriched Earth Ecovillage shall be a place of learning; harmony, transformation, prosperity and a place where each individual shall be sovereign over themselves while working in concert with their community colleagues through shared values and vision.

Low Impact Co-Housing

We are founding members of Co-Housing NI and aim to build a series of low impact, sustainable houses. We wish these to blend into the land, with a grass roof and also to be ornate through the inclusion of indigenous style artwork. We intend to build using Hempcrete as having excellent thermal mass. These houses shall serve as homes for residents and also as guesthouses for responsible and sustainable eco-tourism of the site. We shall also have a camping and glamping area for guests and tourists and hostel accommodation.

Community Hub

We will have a Community Hub for workshops on sustainable living such as agroecology, for community meetings, for celebrating traditional seasonal festivals e.g. Lughnasa, for hosting an annual Early Gaelic Harp festival, a Poetry Festival, Community Theatre and a wide range of cultural enrichment and cross-community activities such as set dancing and yoga classes. The Community Centre will have an adjacent cafe and shop to sell local and organic produce and regional arts and crafts. This will be a place of genuine social and cultural integration, were all are made welcome regardless of age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or physical ability. True traditional hospitality shall be part of our legend! We will have a community library and also a natural outdoor amphitheatre.

Eco Education Interactive Adventure Trail

The area around the centre will be made into an outdoor Eco Education Area in the design of a labyrinth all presented in a very imaginative, fun and interactive way. The core themes of the very successful Green Flag Eco-Schools Program (with which we are in the process of piloting formal afffliation) will be referenced for example the topic of Litter will be explored via ‘The Island of the Legendary Litter Monster.’ It will be designed as an enjoyable place of education for all ages from nursery school to OAP and a great, healthy, enriching and rewarding family experience. We intend for this Eco Education area to become in itself one of the ‘must-see’ visitor attractions in Northern Ireland.

Economic Benefits

It is envisaged that this exciting initiative will not only serve to enrich the lives of its residents and guests but will also be a boon to the local economy and community through its cultural program, unique small business enterprises and through attracting the ever-growing eco-tourism market sector.

One of our primary case studies is Findhorn Ecovillage in Scotland, which brings in an incredible £2,500,000 in annual revenue, also Sólheimar Ecovillage in Iceland which is extremely prosperous and hosts 35,000 guests per year. We also have case studied the Eden project which has brought in an over £1 Billion to the local Cornwall economy. We are a not-for-profit Social Enterprise but we do intend of have our Ecovillage as a place of prosperity in all ways.

Synergised Social Enterprises 

We also seek to promote traditional crafts such as blacksmithing, pottery, soap making and willow weaving through a series of interlinked small business enterprises. We will also have a music recording studio and a multi-media suite.
Forest Gardening and Renewable Energy
We shall grow our own ‘forest garden’ food, keep free-range livestock and aim to power the site through passive solar heating of homes and renewable energy sources such as solar panels, wind and water turbines.

Wild Outdoor Spa Area

The site will also feature a wildlife and meditation pond, a natural swimming pool, an outdoor sauna, outdoor hot-tubs, a sensory garden, a wildflower meadow and an herb garden.to facilitate health in mind, body and spirit of residents, guests and the wider local community.

We Need You!

We need people who seek to be residents and also we need seed-investors in this cutting-edge social and rural development project. We are also exploring and open to a variety of available public aid and funding options and will run a crowdfunding campaign.

Are you someone who wishes to be part of a vibrant, ecological community cooperative? Are you an ethical investor who can see the potential for growth in this ever more relevant market-sector? Are you a public servant with a duty to ensure the welfare of your nation and local area? Then please do not hesitate to get in touch! Every ingredient is essential in optimizing the potential of this potent enterprise of ecological inspiration!

Let’s learn to enrich the earth together as we move into an era of actually dealing with Climate Change as one of the greatest threats to our species and other environmental and social problems via this cutting edge and sustainable model of good practice. Our children and our children’s children deserve NI to have an Educational Ecovillage and it is not too soon… not too late.

Be part of the solution…

Yours in service to All

mission/vision: We Kin, do this!

To honour and cultivate the component character of self-elected individuals with diverse skillsets and dialoged/demonstrated common values, including an ecological, permaculture and biodynamic focus.
This can facilitate a highly viable alternative of creative and truly affordable living in a large , natural , common space, while attending to basic needs for survival, at a minimum, towards thriving , ...regardless of societal changes.
We would endeavour to explore the best of private/personal space in the midst of a shared, eco-sustained Commons and site-appropriate infrastructure.
In free association, we encourage co-generative enterprise both for profit and the benefit of the Commons, in a sustainable manner.
Largely off-grid ,some but hydro/septic zones optional, we remain open to more appropriate ways of harmonizing with natural/cosmic cycles, respecting water, atmosphere, soil, and woodland.
Our progressive eco-village experience will concurrently be an income/educational forum and/or retreat for any who seek the same expansive forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/communikindred-in-ontario/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/communikindred-in-ontario/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ongoing personal and online dialog, outlining and documenting common parameters of like-mindedness in variants of con-sense-us governance, features, mission/vision sustainability, affordability.
Rugged acres are still available since our website initiation 3+ yrs. ago, in mixed-forest regrowth. Once acquired, this will be a pioneering effort, largely offgrid but with a few optional hydro near a 4-season rd. We hope to be on the land in 2018, gradually developing according to resources, as our financial pledges increase. There is currently room for about 10-20 dwellings...mostly offgrid.. plus community centre with hydro, and other commons buildings/and gardens.
Would-be incorporated shareholders can access all relevant info. from or via our website or subsequent email contact.
There are varying levels of membership, from: reserving a future space, camping/retreat, part-time or fulltime resident....tinyhouse-on-wheels, or earth-fixed dwellings. Complementary onsite private and Commons entrepreneurial generation is encouraged, and Organic/Biodynamic/Permaculture protocol for food production required.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22559&quot;&gt;Valley of Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Valley of Light is a sustainable spiritual community dedicated to the Principle of Peace and to the Universal Laws of Truth, Love, and Light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-valley-of-light/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-valley-of-light/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Valley of Light is a micro-community founded by members of The Oracle Institute, a 501(c)(3) educational charity and think tank which serves as an advocate for Peace and a vanguard for Conscious Evolution. Oracle operates an award-winning publishing house, a multi-faith spirituality school, and a global peacebuilding practice. Recently, Oracle organized the “Building the New World” conference at Radford University, which FIC co-sponsored.

The Valley of Light (“VOL”) is a sustainable, spiritual community located in a high energy region within the New River Valley of Virginia. VOL is nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains in a small town called Independence. We have 22 stunning acres along the New River, which is the oldest river in the Western Hemisphere and the third oldest river in the world. 

VOL Members are aware that the world is on the verge of a major paradigm shift, the likes of which we have not witnessed in 2000 years. The worldwide resurgence of religious fundamentalism coupled with emerging New Age theosophies are just two indicators that we are in the midst of intense spiritual confusion and a looming sociological transformation. 

VOL Members also are cognizant of the many unprecedented factors contributing to this turbulent period, including: global warming, food and water shortages, pandemic indicators, terrorism, energy limitations, and a lack of visionary focus by political and business leaders. We therefore believe that the key to a smooth transition into the 21st Century is the adoption of a new way of living based on an awareness of the interconnectedness of all life. To that end, Oracle and VOL are committed to creating a model micro-community using the most advanced community on the planet as our template: The Federation of Damanhur in Italy.

Currently, VOL is building the “Peace Pentagon,” our community center and headquarters for our charity, The Oracle Institute. From the Peace Pentagon, we will expand our peace programs to include a multi-media “HUB.” VOL is designing the HUB with Barbara Marx Hubbard and a team of IT experts. Ms. Hubbard has visited the Peace Pentagon and supports a bicoastal HUB network, with the East Coast HUB at the Valley of Light in Independence, Virginia, and the West Coast HUB in Berkeley, California.

This project is being initiated under the auspices of Valley Veg, Inc., a non-profit community organization which is an alliance of animal welfare, healthy eating, and environmental advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/valley-veg-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/valley-veg-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This vegan cohousing community will have multi-family and clustered dwellings, including residences suitable for older vegans.  It will include a common house with a dining room and kitchen, and other shared facilities such a library, guest rooms, exercise room, and gardens.  The community will be planned, owned and managed by the residents – who can share in decision-making and social activities.  We are currently gathering potentially interested community members and searching for a site in the Northampton, Massachusetts area.</description>

      <name>Anahata Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22561&quot;&gt;Anahata Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To offer a place where residents can express their essential gifts and guests may learn new ways to help to re-balance their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/anahata-village-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/anahata-village-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Anahata Village is currently in creation stages. At the moment, but we are hoping to find land just outside of lovely Eugene, Oregon. We have a small, but growing group of kind and caring people who share the dream of creating this special place to live and offer services.

Our Vision:
We imagine a community which will function in several layers. The first, being an intentional community which does not stand in judgement of religion, disability or lifestyle, but accepts people into the group based on how well they mesh with the others in the community as well as their enthusiasm about our goal to help others.

Anahata Village hopes to become self-sustaining, paying for itself and offering a salary for its members. We plan to do this through a holistic retreat which will offer many services to the public in order to help others to maintain health or to bring it back to a state of balance. Our focus will be classes and seminars for those with chronic disease such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease, but we will also offer ongoing classes for health maintenance, such as yoga and meditation.

A labor of love:
Anahata would like to offer work to its residents which they might feel passionate about doing. If you have always wanted to teach herbal classes or yoga, build cob houses or greenhouses, work with animals or cultivate organic gardens, we hope to offer you a way to earn your living doing those things that you really love. We will also have room for volunteers and workers who are not Anahata residents, as well as residents who prefer to keep the job they had before they moved onto the land. However, we would like to see some contribution to the whole if you choose to live with us. Otherwise, you might be happy living elsewhere as we want people who are excited about what we stand for and want to help.

What we will offer our guests and community members:

*Meditation
*Yoga
*Tai Chi
*Qi Gong
*Reiki
*Massage
*Quantum Touch
*Herbal Tinctures (to buy and instructional classes)
*Organic, alkaline meals as well as alkaline cooking classes
*Art Therapy
*Organic gardening for health
*Medicinal and gourmet mushroom education
*Products to avoid for better health
*Tiny house and cob house building

We will offer apprenticeships for those interested in the possibility of becoming a member. Also, coursework credit may be given for volunteering with us.

We are currently working on our 501(c)3 and business plan, as well as finishing up our website. If you are interested in joining with or helping us on any level, please contact us here or on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/pages/Anahata-Village/1379104809032903?sk=info&amp;tab=page_info

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22562&quot;&gt;Q  Center of Experimentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To offer a favourable environment for the developement and fulfillment of human beings
for the sake of a Culture of Peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/q/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/q/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Q is a individual and small groups retreat space surrounded by nature,
where to experience a simple and conscious lifestyle, with low environmental impact.
A place where to internalize, meditate, change habits, become aware, be oneself.

In Q we experience a modus vivendi that integrates 3 key dimensions of human life: 
Economy, Ethics and Spirituality. 3 essential spheres for local and planetary sustainability.

We experiment and inquire with the following purposes in the middle and long term:

1. At the economic level:
To move towards an economic system based 50% on monetary exchange and 50% in
non-monetary exchange, where gradually the use of money is reduced and the barter, 
the social links and networks, is proportionally increased.
To do this, we consider essential: reducing the needs, optimizing the management of all 
resources, and establishing organic working times and rhythms linked to natural cycles.

2. At the ethical level:
To establish a community of 6 like-minded people, able to develop an agile and effective 
organization without leader. A conjunction of &quot;ones&quot; co-directing Q. This requires in each 
person full capacity for self-determination, initiative and performance; lot of awareness,
responsibility and transparency.

3. At the spiritual level:
To strengthen the circle of people who choose Q to do their practices, initiations and 
teachings, individually and small groups retreats. We provide a space open to all non dual 
traditions. And a neutral place for inter-and-transreligious meetings.</description>

Efficient land management practices and the use of livestock are key to our farming practices. Our integrated farm includes: the use of self pollinating crops specifically chosen for our environment that have not been genetically altered, purebred Galloway and South Devon cattle selected for hardiness and grazing efficiency, mixed oak and hickory woodlots in which we run and finish a select herd of Poland China pigs. Border Leicesters and Southdown sheep are rotationally grazed with their fleeces being processed on the farm. Poultry includes Chantecler large fowl, Muscovy ducks, and Roman geese used for weed and insect management. Draft horses are used extensively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/pinecone-farms/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/pinecone-farms/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Queer commune based on 1920s integrated farming</description>

Various on-site land-based businesses will support the members and community non-profit to fulfill its mission to exemplify green living and help educate others who wish to build and live sustainably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/catalyst-ecovillage-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/catalyst-ecovillage-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;NOTE: We are closing on the purchase of 75 acres by March 15th and need a few more people to contribute to the downpayment and help us with loan repayments to the local Farm Credit Bureau! Come join us now! We are doing this! Email: teaganblackburn@gmail.com immediately with any questions!

Vision Statement

Catalyst is a forming intentional community and eco village in upstate New York.

We aspire to live and demonstrate a lifestyle of deep ecology and social cohesion. A zero carbon, fossil fuel free, energy positive community that enriches its surroundings. A community where neighbors are family and family is tribe. Each supporting the others to make a lighter and more loving load for all. A community that serves and nurtures its members so that they in turn may work hard to better serve the world.

THE PLACE
Our community will have clusters of individual eco homes, a large workshop for creation and maintenance, and the group house for low income housing and the large community center building will be the focal points of the social community. They will be artistic and bold.

The property we are currently considering is about an 1 hour and 15 minutes northwest of the city. Its 75 acres, including 5-10 acres for building and landscaping, 40 cleared acres for farming and livestock and 30 acres of forest. The property has living space for 3 founding families, plus a 10 horse stable, workshop, and large gathering space. Biking distance to two towns.

Our buildings will be aesthetically beautiful and designed to excite and inspire the soul. They will be made of natural and clean materials that are common to the area. They will feature passive and active solar, geothermal, living roofs, radiant floors, composting toilets, water catchments, constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment, recycled materials, and year around indoor plant growing.

Our shared Community Center will be a shared common space for community dinners; meetings; parties and movie nights; workshops; retreats/yoga/meditation; childcare; office space for entrepreneurial incubation; a date night room,; and other common interests of the community. It will have an outdoor hot-tub.

Our Group House will have multiple bedrooms and apartments that will be available for permanent low-income co-housing and space for visitors and guests of our retreat center.

Our clustered smaller-footprint Eco Housing Units will be available for purchase by members wishing to join the community. The will be organized into pedestrian-centric villages and feature private kitchens and living rooms.

THE PEOPLE
We are CURRENTLY SEEKING 1-4 other founding families/couples or individuals that are interested in joining us in purchasing the property. These would be people who have the resources and credit to take a home loan or own a home that they would be willing to sell.

We are also seeking designers, engineers, permaculturists, natural builders and architects that can help us design our utopia. We are also seeking lawyers with property tax experience, and bankers/lenders/investors with vision and people with Community Land Trust knowledge.

Our community will be open and welcoming to conventional and non-conventional families of all configurations and individuals of all races, genders, economic backgrounds and sexual preferences.

Our community is based on non-violence and non-violent communication. We seek kind, compassionate, intelligent, creative, smart, and rational people that share its vision and can participate in consensus decision making.

THE LAND
Our community will have several greenhouses and will grow organic food and algae year around. The algae will be used to make fuel for the community vehicles.

Our community will use community and conservation land trusts to permanently preserve both farmland and wild nature on our site, and take advantage of those tax exemptions as well.

Our community will host a biodynamic community supported agriculture project to grow our own organic food and herbs. We will grow our own and/or lease space to local farmers. Our community will keep livestock or create partnerships with local farmers in order to have local milk and eggs. Our community will have an permaculture orchard for fruit and nuts. Biodynamic principles and permaculture design will be joyously implemented.

Our community will have a large and well-equipped wood and metal shop that will be used to build, and maintain the property and also to create art and beauty throughout. Artist studios too.

SELF RELIANCE
Our community will create jobs and income through:
farming; gardening; keeping horses and renting stables; hosting workshops and retreats; arts and music events; and an eco bed and breakfast.

Our community will have a vibrant mixed-ages homeschooling group (4-11) with a dedicated classroom and a certified teacher hired by a pool of parents, inside and outside of the community. It will be play-based, experiential, Waldorf-inspired, largely outdoor education and have intrinsic opportunities for cross-pollination with the elders, farm chores, and for local community service projects, while integrating the NYS homeschooling academic benchmarks.

Our community will found an assisted care elder-care program for members as they age and for members’ aging parents and relatives, creating onsite paying jobs for our members who are nurses, healers, and health care practitioners.

Our community will seek to document all that it does in hopes of replicating and helping to create a better model for sub-urban and rural development, especially in the surrounding area. Some members will travel as part of a consulting business to start new ecovillages all over this country and in others.

Our community will have a have a blast making a difference!</description>

Staying with us is a vibrant immersion in our community lifestyle which many visitors find to be transformative and life changing.

We make important, long term decisions by consensus of community members. Our community currently includes: 10 adult members, 2 children, 3 trial members, 3 long-term guests (and their 2 children). We hold an intention of expanding to 12 to 20 full-time members. We own the land in common, each paying an equal share to buy-in, to ensure authentic power balance.  We are actively looking for new members at this time.

Our organic farm practices tropical permaculture in our lush rainforest climate. We bought our land in 2005 and currently grow a large portion of our food. We are growing many kinds of fruits, nuts, and have extensive gardens and greenhouses, taro beds and orchards. We keep bees, chickens, rabbits and sheep who are our natural lawn mowers in addition to providing us with food and fertilizer.

Our electricity comes from solar photovoltaic panels, and our water is from a rainwater catchment system. We value alternative and sustainable building techniques.

We host conferences and events relating to permaculture and new culture as well as run ongoing farm support opportunities and intensive month long internship programs.

We live in one of nature’s most amazing places, surrounded by mountains, oceans, dense jungle and warm pools.  We are a short drive from the active volcano and the fresh lava fields.  Our visitors enjoy exploring the many unique features of this land, and the cultural activities nearby.

If you are on the Big Island, give us a call and come visit for a few hours, or days, and take a tour of our land and gardens. 

We hope to meet you someday – as a visitor, guest, farm supporter, intern, or possible new member!</description>

-To create a space for people to visit and learn about sustainability and spiritual development.
-To live neo-tribally as a mindful and compassionate community which supports each member with each step on whichever life path they choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ubuntu-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ubuntu-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ubuntu is a Zulu word which translates roughly to mean &quot;human kindness,&quot; but the first time we ever heard the term it was explained to mean &quot;I am because we are.&quot; Either way, it is the philosophy around which our community is based. Ubuntu Ecovillage is a forming ecovillage (a community based around sustainability) that is committed to community based living and mutual spiritual and philosophical growth. 

We share common spiritual practices based on New Age, Earth-based religions, Eastern religions, and New Thought. Our common living practices are inspired by Daniel Quinn's New Tribalism, and are focused on a responsible, equal, and natural human relationship with the Earth and non-human people (animals). As such, our diet is ovo-vegetarian, and all members are committed to a practice of compassion toward all living things.</description>

Hemp Nation also strives to provide all the tools and materials needed to grow, process, and package hemp products including land, seeds, fertilizer and planting tools.

The participants work the fields, grow houses, or labs, manning all the equipment while learning hands on in a live environment. A portion of whole goods is kept by Hemp Nation for other projects while the rest is evenly distributed among the participants for the last and most creative lab in a coursework track - “The Finishing Lab.” All who enter The Finishing Lab are considered artists - no longer participants - and are taught and encouraged to take care in their creative process as they turn their hemp whole goods into ready-to-use or ready-to-sell conditioned merchandise, also known as retail goods.</description>

We are committed to sharing talents, resources and responsibilities and to live in a healthy way, leaving a small footprint on the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/aria-cohousing-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/aria-cohousing-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Aria Cohousing Community is built on an authentic commitment to one another and to the community beyond. Cohousing is a type of intentional, collaborative housing in which residents actively participate in the design and operation of their community. The current Aria Cohousing members share a common commitment to living in a healthy, sustainable community. The former Marycrest convent at the heart of the larger Aria Denver was redeveloped into a 28-unit inter-generational cohousing community.  Eight of the 28 units are designated as affordable. Only two units remain! Please visit http://ariacohousing.com for more information.

An eight-minute drive north of downtown Denver, Aria Denver is a 17.5 acre transit-oriented, mixed-use, mixed-income development located within the Chaffee Park neighborhood. Aria Denver is designed for urban-minded people who share a vision for being part of a close-knit community. 

Aria Denver, in partnership with Regis University and the surrounding neighborhoods, has created the Cultivate Health Project to support the health and wellness of the entire community. This project, which is funded by the Colorado Health Foundation, will create infrastructure and programming that encourage an active lifestyle, increase access to healthy food and offer integrated health services.  The project will bring a one-acre production garden at Aria Denver, improvements to pedestrian and bicycle routes in the neighborhood, new adult exercise zones at Aria and Zuni Park and many more exciting projects in the Regis and Chaffee Park neighborhoods.</description>

The Pineolia Manifesto 
January 24, 2017, Draft #4 
by Ken Nelson

Introduction

I wish to establish a future intentional community called Pineolia (Pine'-o-li-a).  What would Pineolia be like, and who would be eligible to become a Pineolian?  This document describes these things and outlines a basic framework for Pineolia.
I have a specific vision for Pineolia.  Therefore, this being the case, I need to be the sole founder including the sole owner of the land that the future community will reside upon.  I know that this goes against conventional wisdom when attempting to create an intentional community, but this is what I'm doing.  
The founder's burdens include all of the things to learn about the buying of land, finding the right property, all of the travel expenses involved, and then actually buying the property.  All of this has been accomplished.  I own 22 acres.
The founder's privilege and advantage is being able to set things up right from the beginning as I the founder would like them to be.  The Founder is automatically the Protector. The Protector protects the land.  Ownership of the land of Pineolia shall remain entirely and exclusively in my name because I absolutely know that I would never end Pineolia by selling the land or using it for some other purpose.  I know that I will keep the land of Pineolia for Pineolia and do my best to keep Pineolia in good shape and keep it going.  
Absolutely undoubtedly the land of Pineolia will be safe in my hands.  I know this because Pineolia is my life's work.  It is the meaning of my life.  It is the reason I exist.  It is my life.  Pineolia forever!  Many, many, many, years from now, upon my death, it will be stated in my Will, to whom the  Protectorship will be passed on to, someone that best fullfills the above ideal.  
The Founder is also the initial gate keeper, deciding at the beginning, who will be considered for membership.  
So far, there is only one Pineolian, ..me.  For Pineolia to reach its full potential, this needs to change.  The &quot;I&quot; will have to change to &quot;we&quot;.
&quot;Build It And They Will Come.&quot; 
Pineolia is to be an experimental combination of Nature, respect for Nature, Peace, Tranquility, Permaculture, Art/Culture, and Economics with its own money (fiat money) and money system.  Visiting and/or participating in this place would be like being in another world or a foreign country with its own unique culture.

Certain Non-compromisable Eternal Things

Certain things that I have established will stay in place for all eternity; just a few ideas that I am 100% attached to.  These are non-compromisable things and they will stay in place forever, unless by unanimous consent they are overturned.  Other ideas by other future Pineolians, that are in harmony with the final draft of this manifesto can be added as “eternal things” by the unanimous consent of the group of multiple co-owners (A.k.a. the Pineolians), and will also stay in place forever, unless by unanimous consent they are overturned.  

The final draft of this manifesto will be the beginning of the future Constitution of Pineolia.  By the time we get to a final draft, it will be a collaboration and compilation of ideas contributed by all Pineolians.


Contributions Of Ideas

In this document I am expressing my contribution of ideas for Pineolia.  It is my slice of the pie of ideas for Pineolia.  

 
I am staking out my place, my territory, defining my roles, within this future community as all other future Pineolians will do.  All staked out territories or &quot;slices of the pie&quot;, must be in harmony with that of all other Pineolians.
 
In the following list of rules, 1 through 7 are very uniquely my creation and go deep to the center of my soul.  Some are the absolutely non-compromisable ones that I hinted at above, while others do have a degree of flexibility which I will individually explain in detail below.  Beyond rule 7 there is also varying degrees of flexibility with many of the rest of the proposed rules, as is the case with this entire manifesto which is open for discussion and negotiation.
1.	The name &quot;Pineolia&quot; (Pine'-o-li-a) is the indisputable, absolutely non-compromisable name for this future intentional community.  There is no flexibility with this one. ( In the dappled light of a pine forest in late May of 1964, this word first came to me and it became the name of the original &quot;intentional world&quot; that we kids had created.) 

2.	I have created the beginning of the &quot;Pineolian Establishment Art&quot;, which so far consists of the letters, the column, the flag, etc. (All these things are explained below.)  It is hoped that other future Pineolians will add to the Pineolian Establishment Art.  I would like them to take ownership of it by giving it their own personal touch making it their's, and create yet even more Pineolian Establishment Art; cultural things of all sorts.  I would like there to be all kinds of art in Pineolia being done by others including an expansion and further enrichment of the Pineolian Establishment Art. 

3.	The Pineolian Alphabet:  Pineolia has its own alphabet, an example of Pineolian Establishment Art.  It goes way back to the original Pineolia of 1964, of kids playing in the woods.  It is actually English in disguise with the Latin letters re-designed.  It is a type of code that makes words look like they are from some exotic language.  And they are, sort of.  It's, ...PINEOLIAN!!!  They produce a certain feeling, atmosphere, or ambiance and are a unique cultural aspect of Pineolia.  There will be trail signs printed in Pineolian and there will be &quot;street&quot; signs as well, as there will be a tiny, miniature village, &quot;Pinesville&quot;, with foot path &quot;streets&quot;.  All signs will have smaller Latin letter English subtitles.  Some may have French, Spanish, German, Chinese, you name it, subtitles also.  

These letters have proven to be quite flexible over the years as their designs have evolved and improved.  Therefore, there is a tradition of flexibility with the design of the letters.  So if a future Pineolian, lets say his name is Jack, is not thrilled with his letter&quot;J&quot;.  He is free to change it to whatever he would like.  Or I will work with that person and together we would come up with a &quot;J&quot; design that he likes. 

4.	The Column Of Pineolia  (Pineolian Establishment Art)
 
Pineolia has its own column.  Eventually all entrances to Pineolia will be flanked by Pineolian Columns.  And somewhere in the middle of Pineolia will be &quot;The Great Column&quot;, a real big one!  

5.	Pineolia has its own flag.  As soon as there is more than one Pineolian, this will be the flag that we will begin with.  If after one year, Pineolia wishes to have a different flag design, we will all design a new one together.

6.	The traditional Pineolian drawing for a pine tree, as shown on the flag, looks more like a fir than a pine.  But, no problem.  Pineolian culture, going all the way back to the original Pineolia, has always considered all evergreens or conifers to simply be different kinds of pine trees.  So therefore, in Pineolian culture, a fir is a type of pine tree.  It's a quirky Pineolian cultural thing of which I am attached.  It helps to set the inner world of Pineolia apart from the outer world.  It adds to it having its own separate identity.  But at the same time, Pineolia does believe in science.  So it believes in science and it cherishes its culture.  If the two ever come into conflict over some decision that needs to be made, then science will trump culture.  Can't let culture stand in the way of truth.  But Pineolia, having its own different botanical classification system, does no harm.

7.	Pineolia will have its own inner economic system with its own money.  One Pine Buck could be worth one bucket of dirt.  One can build with dirt.  This is a hint at a basis for a mini economic system.  The money will also serve as a platform for Pineolian Culture with the Pineolian letters displayed on the bills and coins.  We will design the money together.
8.	Permaculture is the way things are grown and built in Pineolia.
9.	Building shall be done with a county permit.  
10.	The overall strategy for the growing of things is basically this:  Along the upper slope, there shall be, for the most part, deciduous trees and plants so that the nutrients flowing down to the middle slope will be beneficial for the growing of food.  The lower slope shall have, for the most part, evergreens. (Pine trees feed the soul of a Pineolian.)  This way the acidic evergreens nutrients will not flow into the food producing areas.  

Certain things I have done with the land shall stay in place, such as all the trees I have planted, the utility dirt roads and trails I have created. (Eternal Things)  And there are other things that I have planned out that also must be, such as the placement of the house that is to be built.  But I may be flexible and open to minor adjustments.  It depends on what the issue is.  
11.	Pineolia is vegetarian.  
12.	Pineolians are lovers of animals, both domestic and wild.  No animal is to be killed in Pineolia, except in a possible rare situation of self-defense or in defense of another (human or animal) against, for example, a bear, cougar, coyote, etc.
13.	Pineolians are non-smokers of tobacco. 
14.	Legal drugs, and that includes alcohol, on occasion in moderation are allowed, but it is the overarching philosophy in Pineolia that you really don't need drugs in paradise.  Pineolia is mainly about natural highs.  One exception, caffeine:  Because you need to be awake to fully enjoy paradise.
15.	Pineolia is a hate free place.  Diversity is the way. 
16.	All Pineolians practice the Golden Rule: &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot;  Pineolians are respectful of the feelings of others and try to practice empathy to all.
17.	Pineolians are egalitarians. This would be enforced by all Pineolians taking turns cleaning a common toilet and bathroom.  The toilet is the great equalizer.
18.	 Pineolia is secular.
19.	Pineolians are primarily just humans, Americans, possibly Canadians or of other national origin, Cascadians, but most of all: Pineolians.
20.	Pineolians are progressives or liberals and they do take an interest in outer world politics.  Pineolians are registered voters and they vote.  
21.	As much as possible beforehand, all who come to Pineolia will have been thoroughly screened.  It will be a place where only friends, friendly neighbors, or at least friendly acquaintances will be invited.  All visitors will have to at least be a friendly acquaintance.  
22.	If there is an outsider that has been truly offensive toward a Pineolian, after the offended Pineolian fully explains the matter to all other Pineolians, all other Pineolians shall stand in support of their fellow Pineolian.  The offended Pineolian will have veto power over the offending outsider from visiting Pineolia.  Pineolia will be the home of all Pineolians.  Offending outsiders will not be welcome in our home.

Pineolians are to be like a family group.  Pineolian empathy occures first and foremost between Pineolians.  The No.1 most important persons in a Pineolians life are the other Pineolians.  That is where a Pineolian's loyalty would lie.    
23.	Friendly outsiders to Pineolia are honored with the title: &quot;Friend Of Pineolia&quot;.  If they have helped Pineolia in some way then they are honored with the title: &quot;Honorary Pineolian&quot;.  And if they have helped Pineolia TREMENDOUSLY, then they are declared to be a &quot;Hero Of Pineolia&quot;, the highest honor Pineolia has to give.  (At this point in time there are now five: Diane, Matt, Shari, Greg, and Nancy.) 
23.	Pets Policy: Only small indoor pets or pets in a confined outdoor area shall be        allowed.
24.	Any valuable mineral or natural resource, and any buried or hidden treasure, found in Pineolia by anyone is automatically absolutely entirely the property of Pineolia.
25.	Pineolia shall be a place of a small number of people.
26.	The words that would describe the scale of everything about Pineolia is small, tiny, and miniature.
27. Pineolia shall be totally in line with respecting the environment.
28. Pineolia shall carry on in such a way as to make the amount of discouragement toward the presence of  wildlife, insignificant.
29.	Pineolia shall bring no harm to any neighbor.  Pineolia shall be devoted to the peace and tranquility of the neighborhood. Pineolia strives for total goodwill, peace, and harmony with its neighbors and the greater surrounding community.
30. Outside the trailer and house, no loud music will be allowed.
31. Pineolia shall be a place of tranquility.
32. A Pineolian is a quiet person and lover of peace and quiet.
33.	Pineolia, except for mainly natural features, shall strive to not be seen from the Deggan's (neighbors) cabin.
34.	Pineolia shall not be heard from the Deggan's cabin.
35.	Ravel's Bolero is the new national anthem of Pineolia.  Check this out.  I think it is truly magnificent.  Play it loud!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-4J5j74VPw  This shall be until, if and when, the future Pineolians decide to change it to something else.

MEMBERSHIP:

As the founder, in the beginning, I will choose who can join.  Persons from all parts of the human family are eligible for consideration provided they are in agreement with the contents of this document.  Naturally I will choose folks that I am in the best harmony with.  

 The founder could consider up to six people all at once, or one at a time.  But as soon as there are more Pineolians than just the Founder, all Pineolians how ever many there are, will decide together who will be considered for membership.  

At this time, so far there are minimal living accomodations for only one person, me.  Applicants and I would have to work things out to increase living accomodations.  We would have to build a house together for us all to live in and equally share the cost and the labor.  This could be a wonderful bonding experience.  The Trailer could eventually become the guest quarters.    

I feel that the highest number of Pineolians that would be appropriate for this size property (22 acres), and for the maintenance of the peace and tranquility of the neighborhood, would be 7 quiet type people.  

1.) Screening:

First, all applicants and I, individually, have to get to know each other, which does take some time.  The ideal way would be for the applicants to live somewhere around here.  The next best thing would be through many correspondences and frequent visits  During this period, we would repeatedly review this manifesto constantly checking the level of harmony between us.    

This would be a long process but it is a crucial one.  &quot;Good things don't come easy.&quot;  All aspects of an applicant must be thoroughly checked out, and this takes a considerable amount of time.  And that's the way it must be and has to be.  It absolutely has to be a good fit and it takes time to see if that is the case.  A very serious matter indeed!  To be a Pineolian is to be a member of a family like group.  So the application process has to be a very serious drawn out affair, but yet with a lot of good cheer all the way through.  I can't think of every scenario that might come up.  So after all is said and done, it has to feel right to me, and if it doesn't, then it is a no go.

2.) Signing:
If all goes well with the screening process, then the next thing would be to sign a legally binding agreement.  A lawyer would be consulted in the composing of this agreement.  By signing, the applicant would be stating that they agree to abide with the contents of the final draft of this manifesto, and there would be a guarantee that the signer is getting what they are paying for.   


3.) One Time Membership Investment of $1000. 
 
I, The Founder, have invested a rough estimate total of $27,000.(Haven't yet taken the time to total it up exactly.)  But being that I am also The Protector, which means that the land of Pineolia stays in my name, the membership investment for all Pineolia applicants shall be only $1000.  The $1000 is paid directly to me all in one lump sum.  Only after a total of $1000 has been paid in full to me would that person become a full fledged Pineolian with all of the full rights of a Pineolian.  

Refund policy:
After moving to Pineolia, for every month living there, that would be $100 less that would be refundable should they then decide that Pineolia is not for them.  After ten months are up, there would be no more refund. 

So if you pay the $1000, what do you get and what are the guarantees?

For $1000 you get a life time membership in Pineolia. You are a Pineolian for life.  You can live in Pineolia.  You share equally in the community of Pineolia and in all the things outlined in this manefesto, plus what ever additional harmonious things you and other Pineolians bring to Pineolia.


The matter of membership is a work in progress, like everything in this Manefesto.  What I have written here is the best I can think of up to this time.  If you have a better idea or ideas, please let me know.  This entire manifesto is open for discussion and negotiation.


Business Ideas For Pineolia:
Three ways I have thought of in which Pineolia could possibly support itself are: 
A.	Farm. 
B.	Small scale camp ground.
C.	Unique Tiny Village
A. Farm.
Using Permaculture techniques we could grow food and sell it at farmers markets.  I think this would probably be the primary way that Pineolia could make money to support itself. 
B. Small scale camp ground.
A limit of up to 7 quiet persons at any one time with whom Pineolia has a friendship may camp-out in Pineolia.  All campers would pay U. S. money to be there and would pay perhaps $10 per 24 hours.  It could be a vacation destination. 

Up to 7 quiet Campers with whom Pineolia has a very well established friendship would be allowed to build seasonal shelters.  They would be built one at a time.  All seasonal shelters would be of a Natural Building type of construction including Strawbale, Earthbag, Cob, Roundwood, etc., and will cover an area no bigger than 100 sq. ft.  This would be an opportunity to experience building in these ways.  They would have no plumbing or electricity and are intended for camping-out during the warmer months only.  The campsites would be closed during the winter.    

All friends who opt to build a seasonal shelter would have to sign an agreement that spells out the conditions under which they can build and thereafter camp out inside what they created.  Friends of friends could camp out in these shelters provided that they are also Pineolia's friends.   

Most of these seasonal shelters would be grouped in and around the tiny, miniature village.  Some may be off by themselves.    

Campers and visitors would use the toilet and shower in the full-fledged house, that is to be built.  The bathroom would have a door to the outside for easy access.  

C. Unique Tiny Village 
It would consist of a variety of hobbit like structures of different types and designs built the natural building way.  People would exchange U.S. Dollars for Pine Bucks as there would be some fascinating little shops producing a product or providing a service, all to be paid for in Pine Bucks.  All U.S. money collected would go to the Pineolia general fund.  
My thing will be to have a little ceramics studio where I'll teach people how to work in clay for a fee in Pine Bucks.  For those folks who have already found their way with clay, they could rent space with Pine Bucks to work in clay.  I'd also produce my ceramic art and sell it for Pine Bucks only.
Pineolia would not be open to the general public.  It would be open exclusively to friends, friends of friends, and friendly acquaintances only, so as to guarantee to keep it nice and personable.  On occasions when the village is officially open, it will be limited to no more than around 12 quiet friends at any one time; invitation only.  

Final Thoughts:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If Pineolia itself is not producing income, then each Pineolian would of course be required to chip in equally to pay the money that is needed to cover expenses such as the ongoing utilities and yearly property taxes.  This would require Pineolians having jobs outside of Pineolia or at least have money from somewhere available to contribute.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to do all of the above simply to do it, not to make a big profit.  Of course I would want Pineolia to make at least a little money, enough to pay the taxes and operating expenses, with a little left over for a rainy day fund for those unexpected expenses and emergencies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this project I am continuing to move into unexplored territory; unexplored by me, that is.  This has been the case ever since I began looking for land to buy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If this seems like paradise to you, if this resonates with you, and if you feel that your ideas would harmonize with these ideas, then lets talk.  This manifesto is open for discussion and negotiation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well that's it up to this point in time.  Your questions, criticisms, thoughts, and comments are all very welcome.  Thank you.</description>

      <name>True Self Eco-Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22582&quot;&gt;True Self Eco-Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our primary goal as a group is to help all involved to free themselves of their spiritual ignorance of the True Self. Our secondary goal is to develop an Eco-Village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/true-self-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/true-self-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;True Self Eco-Village is a center where we envision spiritual practitioners can gather to help one another deepen their knowledge of Who we truly are and establish a sustainable way of life in an Eco-Village setting. In order to initiate these goals, we need to assemble a group of co-founders who would meet regularly in Spokane, WA for the purpose of discussing the type of community that participants would like to form. At this time, we can determine where people's interests lie and learn what they can commit themselves to doing in a collectively implemented project.

During these meetings, we could discuss how this vision would fit into our lives. We could focus on related and practical goals people might be ready to commit to actualizing. We already have a well-maintained homestead where we have striven to live a food and energy self-reliant lifestyle since 1990. This would be a ready made setting for those who sense this to be a stable foundation upon which to build a sustainable way of life. People might want to join us in this lifestyle and set up households or camp sites. Or, members may want to support the establishment of a CSA where they could come to the farm once a week to collect baskets of fresh, organically grown produce. Using a land trust format seems to be the most practical approach which would integrate the co-founders into becoming the Trustees and Beneficiaries of this trust.

In the planning process, we can carefully consider what each individual could commit their energies to in the development of this Eco-Village and write up its mission statement, other important documents and material details. We can also discuss how we might combine our efforts with other aware individuals, who are not members of our co-op effort, in order to help one another transit the social and environmental crisis unfolding in The World. In the near future, the importance of developing such cooperative and collaborative infrastructures cannot be understated.

We are also receptive to dialoguing with those who are interested in associate memberships. Those who might live in distant locations could become involved in the Eco-Village in supportive roles. We also have an opportunity available for a couple or individual with organic growing experience who would like to join us in the capacity of stewards of the land and to establish a CSA. We have the necessary growing infrastructures and tools, and all profits would go to the growers as we do not need any compensation.

Our ultimate wish is to effectively synchronize with those who realize that evolutionary imperatives are calling us to transcend our separateness and to unite our efforts in an intentional community setting. There are many options we are open to exploring, so please take the time to outline where your interests lie and contact us via the email link provided at this site.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22583&quot;&gt;Piedmont Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our intention is to create a healthy environment where children can play together in safety, and where neighbors work collaboratively towards the good of the community while respecting each other’s independence.  Our ecovillage will serve as an education center to promote green building practices, alternative energy use, and other principals of sustainable design.  The neighborhood will include a shared common house and will maximize green space for a variety of purposes, including recreation and community gardens. We will offer several housing options including detached single-family homes, attached homes, and tiny homes. All structures will employ green building practices such as passive solar design to minimize our community’s carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/piedmont-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/piedmont-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are in the planning stage of developing a new ecovillage in one of the counties surrounding Richmond, Virginia. Our vision is to create a diverse rural community which fosters social interaction, integrates sustainable practices, and serves to educate and inspire others. Our aim is to create an environment of growth, for people, families, kids, pets, gardens, wildlife, crops, hearts and spirits. Our intention is to do so, in a non-hierarchical way, through dynamic governance (Sociocracy) while incorporating a healthy balance of individual privacy and community sharing.  

Our community will include: shared gardens, orchards, rain-water harvesting, composting, recycling, multi-purpose/re-configurable indoor and outdoor areas, pedestrian paths, renewable energy, a shared maker-space, common meals, and all manner of shared wisdom, from yoga to martial arts, and beekeeping to permaculture.

Another priority will be to have the common house act as a not-for-profit, educational center which will strive to instruct others on the valuable lessons of living gently and nurturing the planet. We envision classes ranging from permaculture, to tiny house construction, to Sociocracy and anything in between – including things we hope to discover along the way as we join together to create our ecovillage. Eventually, we expect to extend the invitation to experience ecovillage living to others. Providing overnight stays in the common house’s guest rooms, to possibly more protracted stays for exploring members or anyone who’s simply eco-curious. 

We’re hoping to break new trail on living simply. We welcome new members, ideas, and support. If you’re interested in learning more, please visit our website: PiedmontEcovillage.org or email ecovillage2014@gmail.com</description>

* We value the lives and rights of all creatures equally, not just humans. We believe an animal should only be killed, either to eat or because it was attacking you or someone you are charged to protect.
* We value the natural world and believe it is healthier for our bodies to follow natural cycles. As such, we tend to celebrate seasonal cycles like spring time or the full moon.
* We value survival skills and believe that the skills needed to build shelter, find food and water and protect yourself and you family from whatever threat, are skills that all creatures need, even humans. We recognise the possibility of a major war or natural disaster and we want to be as prepared as we possibly can be for it.
* We value emotional bonds and community above material pursuits. We believe that doing daily tasks (cooking and gathering food, planting etc.) with people who have a vested interest in each other strengthens the spirit and builds trust. We think that people need to rediscover their own personal value to society. Everyone needs emotional security, why not give it to them?
* We value consent and believe that everyone should be offered the chance to say &quot;no&quot; to anything that impacts their own body and have their wishes respected. The kind of consent often talked about is sexual, but there are many other things that are done to us in the external world, non-consensually. Schooling and education, pollution, fashion and nudity, medical treatment, communication (the right to peaceful protest) and a multitude of trivial or social rules made by external entities to control every tiny thing, all come into this.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22586&quot;&gt;Ten Thousand Hands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To establish an egalitarian community centered in meditation, simple and sustainable living, service and social action. A place where we honor each other as treasures, beholding each other and relating to each other with mutual appreciation and gratitude. A place where community is a practice and invitation to be companions of the way, friends who encourage, inspire and lovingly support each other in embodying a true and meaningful life, a free and liberated life, grounded in peace, kindness, compassion and great joy. 

The community will also be headquarters for Ten Thousand Hands a 501(c)3 nonprofit motivated by an appreciation for the preciousness of all life, our relations with others and the world; our interconnectedness with all and boundless compassion. TTH is dedicated to the meditative life, to hearing the cries of all in need and responding with compassionate aid and together action for people, animals and the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ten-thousand-hands/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ten-thousand-hands/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Interested in Living in A Dharma House, Intentional Community-A Sangha, and a Non-Profit all in one/An Egalitarian Dharma Community That Is Family and Pet Friendly

Ten Thousand Hands is an unaffiliated and nonsectarian meditation organization. We are looking to establish an intentional community, urban and/or larger rural eco-village with an aim of living a simple meditative life, developing friendships with like-minded people, and supporting and encouraging each other in practicing and embodying the dharma. We will nurture our practice with sharing silence/group meditation, some shared meals and chores, monthly community meetings and organizational roles. 

In addition to meditative work our work encompasses areas of food; shelter, hospitality and housing; clothing; outreach and care for incarcerated and formally incarcerated; the sick, elderly and dying; care for the dead; animal rescue, rehabilitation and sanctuary; sustainability (farm/food, housing, transportation), conservation and reclamation. Advocacy and activism for peace (opposing war and violence), justice, human and animal rights, sustainability and environmental care.

Group meditation which shall be open to the public, includes silent sittings interspersed with short walking periods followed by tea and occasionally a talk. One may meditate in whatever style they wish within the silent sitting and walking format. Private meetings with a teacher shall be made available throughout. All activities are optional though we ask that residence have a commitment to meditation and respect silence during designated silent times. There is no requirement to adopt any philosophy or beliefs to participate nor are there any rituals or ceremonies.

The living environment shall be both vegetarian/vegan friendly and ecologically friendly including preservation of nature and wildlife, as well as organic conservation farming. Food shall be mostly organic consisting of local produce. Meals offerings shall be vegan/vegetarian and sattvic/ayurvedic. Some shared meals shall be taken in silence and some in open fellowship (with talking).

Our structure is egalitarian with all major decisions made by the community as a whole in the manner of Friends (Quaker consensus).

Some of us may work outside jobs, others may work more around the house and on community projects, including outreach, community cottage industries/not for profit businesses and raising funds via donations.

Although all are welcome to apply, preference in available residential opportunities is given to those who consider their practice the center of their life and wish to deepen in it by contributing to a meditation community. We are also interested in those who hold knowledge/expertise in the areas of administration, public relations or development, fund raising, social media, and any area in which services are being offered.

All activities and services shall be offered as a gift, by free will donation basis.

We will purchase property to make it a permanent community, but for now we may rent one residence large enough for everyone.

VALUES AND CUSTOMS WE CHERISH AND SHARE
Repentance/penitence, atonement, kindness, compassion, honesty, humility, love of work and the arts, down to earthness, meditation, humor, simplicity/frugality, peace/non harming/nonviolence, freedom, self-reliance, selfless service, unpaid service to others, hospitality, holding goods in common, homelessness, charity, social justice, nonviolent resistance/direct action, wisdom and liberation. However, wisdom, compassion and liberation are given the highest emphasis, being the ground upon which all other customs arise.

We work together to create a living space abundant in food, beauty, harmony and higher self- expression that sustains our needs for survival and thrival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/one-song-eco-spirit-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/one-song-eco-spirit-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Aloha,

We are looking for apprentices and/or potential permanent residents with experience and passion for working and learning with the Aina and growing food. We are an established community and a mature permaculture farm.  Our farm began in 2000 with a few old buildings, and now has seven acres of mature permaculture landscaping, buildings and infrastructure.  It's located in a very isolated part of Maui – a 2 ½ hour drive from the main city, much of it on a winding one-lane road.  It's off-grid, but has a large photovoltaic system, solar hot water, a wood-fired sauna, a laundry facility, and two community kitchens. There are two large structures and fifteen smaller hales, providing living space for the fifteen residents and paying guests, in addition to a teepee and open air dome structure for community gatherings.  We offer a weekly public Cafe and open mike, with food prepared primarily from our half-acre garden and on-site food forest.  We have our own beautiful smooth black stone beach down steep cliff steps, with its continual sound of the waves.  

There are several weekly community meetings and circles which everyone is expected to attend. We live according to the &quot;four agreements&quot;, if you're familiar with that book. We share a common spirituality that recognizes our unity with one another and with our Mother Earth. Some meetings are for logistics and some are for personal, community and spiritual growth.  The learning available for apprentices includes diverse aspects of permaculture, gardening, Natural Korean Farming, poultry management (chickens and ducks) integrated into our ponds and gardens similar to the Vietnamese VAC ponds/gardens/livestock classic permaculture system, living in community, food preparation, sharing music, being mentored and engaging in personal spiritual growth.  There is a core group who live here permanently, with the rest of the community made up of younger temporary residents who may stay three months or longer. Everyone has work expectations – minimally four hours a day on average. Some days are free, when someone else is cooking and there aren't any community work projects or events.  On Cafe day we all chip in and do what's necessary to provide a delicious meal for as many as 50-75 outsiders who come to eat, listen, and participate in the open mike event. Work here includes gardening, fruit tree planting, harvest and maintenance, harvesting and cooking vegetables for community meals, cleaning the guest cabins and the main house, coconut harvest and coconut products preparation, building projects, preparing for the Cafe and more.

      <name>Kotare Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22588&quot;&gt;Kotare Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Koanga Institute was co-founded by Kay Baxter and Bob Corker, and is part of a 30-year journey to save New Zealand heritage food plants, and experience self-reliance and community development. In the process of saving the seeds, we came to the realization that seed saving is just one aspect of the broader need to address the foundations of our ‘human ecology.’ The challenge became bigger.  See Bob’s story.

We believe we are on the cusp of enormous changes that will see our normal life challenged on many fronts, as the economic, environmental and social costs of maintaining an industrial consumer society and exponential economic growth become increasingly unsustainable and undesirable.

Our response is to invest in a village community that creates its own culture of regeneration, self-reliance, and resilience, not only for the village itself, but to be an active part of seeding transformation in the community – both New Zealand and the around the world.

This is not a place to ‘escape from the world’, or to protest against it. It will take years of hard work and determination, but we believe it is better to affirm a new way than wait for our mainstream society to transform.

We invite you to be part of this transformation and part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kotare-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kotare-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Koanga Institute​, home of New Zealand's largest heritage seed collections​ is moving its focus towards becoming a leading centre for regenerative living​.​  Our latest project, Kotare Village, is looking for like-minded people who want to support a shared dream of embracing a regenerative future through independent village living, local economies and co-evolution.

Regenerative Agriculture:
Much has been made of the modern term ‘sustainable’. However, within the context of depleting and degenerating resources, we now understand that we need to regenerate our resources, not just sustain them in their current form.

The term “regenerative” describes processes that restore, renew or revitalize their own sources of energy and materials, creating sustainable systems that integrate the needs of society with the integrity of nature.

Our use of regenerative agriculture can be characterized by these principles:
-Use of ecological systems that sequester carbon and improve water availability.
-Development of multi-tiered perennial polycultural systems that maximise solar collection, fully utilize all soil depths, eliminate the need for fossil fuels and imported fertilisers, and have multiple high total yields that service the needs of our community.
-High use of management-intensive systems, rather than imported-resource-intensive systems
-Holistic management (Allan Savory)
-Intensive selection of species and cultivars, for the ‘best fit’ to the local environment and culture
-Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), to support our farmers and efficiently provide healthy food for the village

Appropriate Technology:
We recognise that much of our present comfortable lifestyles are based on technologies that may become less accessible and/or affordable, and that they usually run counter to our desire for self-reliance and regenerative systems. We have a commitment to adapting to appropriate technologies, those that are small-scale, decentralized, people-centred, energy-efficient, environmentally sound, and locally controlled.

Some of the ideas we are exploring further include:
-Living simply, with less need for energy
-Developing our limited hydroelectric sites
-Meeting as many of our energy needs from wood-based biofuel systems
-Rocket stoves and gasifiers
-Vehicle fleet
-Electricity generation
-Heating water from a combination of solar and biofuels
-Ram pumps in the Mangaone stream to pump summer water to storage from the Hill Block
-Composting toilets
-Greywater systems
-Passive home heating and cooling
-Developing generic house design using largely local, non-toxic materials

Empowering Social Relationships:
While much of the focus of our vision is on the regeneration of our ecology and our economy, we understand the importance of regenerating our communities through empowering social relationships on all levels. We recognise that this is a major challenge, as we transform from our existing relationships and communities to something better.

We recognise there are no easy solutions. It requires a commitment to finding what strategies and techniques work best and being willing to apply them consistently. We will take care to ensure these processes are given due support within all our organisations.

Some key points we have come across so far are:
-Fair, documented, participatory decision making, consultation processes
-Clear identification of stake holders and decision makers
-Encouraging the learning of communication skills
-Meeting techniques that will facilitate trust and build consensus, including meeting protocols, clear agendas, sharing circles, non-violent communication, etc.
-Clear, documented conflict resolution techniques
-Empowering leaders and/or managers in specialist fields
-Taking individual responsibility for our actions
-Choosing to participate in personal and group activities that build strength in our relationships</description>

      <name>Ka´Way Monti NGO</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22589&quot;&gt;Ka´Way Monti NGO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Ka’Way Monti (KM), is a nonprofit organization that aspires to live up to its name, which means “Tree of Life” in the local Quechua dialect. KM was founded in July 2012 in Huaraz, Peru, with recognition of a Spiritual Truth, the need to bring humanity back into balance with nature, and the tremendous capacity for humanity to do good work.

Mission Statement.
The mission of Ka’Way Monti ( KWM) is to embody sane, holistic, healthy, sustainable modes of life, in search of balance and harmony within individuals, between individuals, and between communities and their environment.

Vision:
The vision of Ka’Way Monti is a network of thriving, spiritually conscious communities that embody ecologically and socially harmonious ways of life.

Core Principles:
Alignment with Great Spirit
Respect for Pachamama, Mother Earth
Service to the Common Good
Cooperation within and between communities
Integrity in Thought, Word and Deed
Honor Work, making it Art and an Offering
Acceptance, Compassion and Humility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kaway-monti-ngo/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kaway-monti-ngo/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ka’Way Monti, meaning “Tree of Life” in Quechua, is a non-profit in Peru founded with recognition of the need to bring humanity back into balance with nature, and the tremendous capacity for humanity to do good work.  In aspiring to live up to its name, Ka’Way Monti (KM) consists of two main branches; KM School for Sustainability (KMSS), and KM Local Vitalization (KMLV).
The vision behind creating the Ka’Way Monti School for Sustainability (KMSS) embodies the overall vision of Ka’Way Monti (KM) itself. KM envisions a network of thriving, spiritually conscious communities that embody ecologically and socially harmonious ways of life. KMSS, and its permaculture and natural construction curriculum, play a vital role in creating the space to study and practice the means by which we can actually manifest this vision.
Founded by Chris Dyson in November 2012, under his direction, with the assistance of volunteers and guest teachers, the school quickly became known with enthusiasm to be a fixture amongst the locals in Llupa. The courses have been held at The Hof Hostel in the municipality of Llupa within the district of Independencia, near the city of Huaraz on the western slopes of the Cordillera Blancas of the Peruvian Andes. Given that Ka’Way Monti has been conceived by immigrants who came to Peru looking for new ways of living, one of the key principles has been a harmonious integration into what already exists in the region.</description>

      <name>East of Eden [Nature Preserve]</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22590&quot;&gt;East of Eden [Nature Preserve]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We have come to realize that the absolute essence of Community …is CommUnion. Thus do we share the grail so many seek

It is in such knowing …that the true Nature of our own Purpose is also revealed ..now it will be expressed in our connection to the rest of Nature.

To this Sacred Space – in the East of Eden – we have come, finally, to nurture what the Creator Consecrated to us in the ‘first place’ …as it was given to us! 

Yes we failed… we allowed everything precious to be exposed to insanity …we lost sight of the perfect Love that was imbued in us all and in every thing…

Yet now we come home …to the East of Eden – to heal this profound breach. 

We are free of culture, prejudice and violence. We are the Warriors of Yesterday’s Children …gathering at last.

Aho!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/east-of-eden/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/east-of-eden/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&quot;the time of the lone wolf is over.....&quot;  We are returning to our Sacred Nature... and there to affirm 'our CommUnity' ...we are at last at East of Eden. 

In this special space ...we are celebrating a dream we had always realized in our hearts  ...only now we come to manifest it in a higher vibration and in a new reality. This is our divine destiny ...at one with the trees, animals, birds, sky, water, earth, stars ...and each other.  We are family ....and our place is at the center of the dream. 
 
We have begun to be what we were meant to be. There is no mystery; it is, after all, just so simple…

Our life is focused on the fresh soil of a new world …i8t is necessary to let go of the paradigm in order to come home… Such is the sweet dream we turned to…  

Much harm has been done to Mother Earth and her Children …the whole of the Universe is aggrieved. 

Now we come forth ...reflecting in ourselves and each other …the profound Love preserved in us ....and thus express with our most humble gratitude...  &quot;we are free at last... !&quot; 

“…The time of the lone wolf is over – gather yourselves” ...so compelling, was this simple advice from Hopi Chief Martin - the whole world could have heard it if they cared. But his words were heeded by only a few: ...we were inspired; so we are here.  

In the final hour ...we turn to Great Spirit.  And in an act of mercy ...leave the 'life' we came to know ...to its destiny. 

=  

East of Eden is, then, a portal to transcend the known world …to the Dream we never forgot ...we honor the sacred path, incline to purity, and live fully, conclusively, in Love.  It is all that was ever free…  

Of course, being aware of the emergent crisis around us - unfathomable though it may be even with all our previous experience …and even as the hapless world around us succumbs to its final delusion  ...we remember to honor its teachings  with the words &quot;...never again!&quot;  

Children of the Earth ...gather in this sacred circle.... hasten the Dream ... weave the cloth ...a new dawn awaits you.

We are at the very edge of the earth - that's where Espiritu Santo is - we have learned well - we know that to protect our progeny - is to protect our destiny - we have to separate from the paradigm; it has failed... Even so we acknowledge our singular and collective responsibility – there is only one standard of accountability...  Karma is absolute and inevitable!

So we come now to the land - all ten or twelve thousand acres of it.  It is entrusted to us, by family.  Now we will take it up in pieces of twelve or more acres …and in whole.  Since we are at the end ….it is as it was in the beginning ...ours to care for!  

We recognize who is ready - they are true to their Nature – it is they who shall vest in the East of Eden destiny ...by the care they will have taken. It may take time; it may be immediate – but everyone is responsible for their own journey …the leaves are falling… 

I, papa bear, have brought forth this land from its ancient past … to be given unto your care forever… as it was given to me [for several generations] by my Kastom brothers and our extended family [in Vanuatu, only families – tribes and clans – ‘own’ land]. It is an understanding that the land will be leased  ...to the East of Eden Foundation for the purposes disclosed in its charter ....for respect.   
 
Some issues attendant upon the land bequeathed to [me] us still persist  ...but they are being settled in Kastom and will be soon ratified in Constitutional Law as well. Nonetheless our right to enjoy the land was given to me in ceremonies that made it so and was witnessed by many of the chiefs and elders of the surrounding communities. This is the serious business of Kastom [culture]. 

Now the land is to be consecrated finally ...from its foundation in yesterday's Dream ...to its destiny in our children’s hands - for this Sacred undertaking ...and from Love we will separate from all that was previously manifest, That's all there is to it. Life is free - and so are we...! 

=

East of Eden expresses no orthodoxy, no doctrine; no system of belief ...it has only the Love of Great Spirit to guide it ...we already live beyond the horizon...  I, papa bear, am no guide …it is the Great Master we serve. We have no other ‘Leader’. 

We will continue to live, build and grow a shared life in all that abounds …as ‘eco-village’ …in ‘permaculture’… but most important, in Communion with each other and the Creation around us. Memories of the still-present paradigm around us will teach us how little of it it is ‘needed’. Thus we will carry on ...until our perimeter is sealed - thereupon access will be made impassible …to learn the ways of new world.  This is our Living Dream. 

Our family will have learned how to live in Communion with Nature…  All we ever wanted or needed was here – the bush feeds, houses and nurtures us [as needed] – we will want for nothing… It is all free.

Beloved Rainbow Family ...Children of the Earth ...take your place ...now is the time you have waited for...  But consider well ...that you are ready

        “When the earth is ravaged and the animals are dying, 
        a new tribe of people shall come unto the earth from many colors, classes, creeds, 
        and who by their actions and deeds shall make the earth green again.
        They will be known as Warriors of the Rainbow”</description>

It is envisioned to be a collective house for folks in New York City who want to live communally, grow their own food and live sustainably.  We will grow food and flowers in the backyard with methods such as permaculture, biodynamic farming and vertical gardening.  We will also compost food waste, cook communal dinners and share some good times.  The community aspires to create an urban living model that's built on love and trust, and we will host group meditation and/or yoga practices to maintain a healthy and loving attitude towards each other.

In the near future, the group will work towards securing farm land in upstate New York (1-2 hours away) so that we can supplement the needs to live in the city with the option to also return to nature during weekends.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22594&quot;&gt;South of Monadnock Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; This group strives to live well together in a way that supports and challenges us to live into our best selves, collectively and individually.  We are working towards our best vision for the future and to honor this property’s history by building authentic community consistent with Quaker practices and principles that prioritizes purposeful, joyful living, peacework, place-based education and Earth stewardship, including diverse, sustainable agriculture and wild-space conservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/south-of-monadnock-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/south-of-monadnock-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;As the purchasers of the Meeting School property, this group strives to build authentic community that is consistent with Quaker principles and practices, and which honors the Meeting School legacy of place-based education, peacework, spiritual seeking, simple living, and long-term commitment to Earth stewardship, including diverse, sustainable agriculture.

When we gather, we do so with an understanding that there is a truth greater than any individual. We gather as a community to listen to each other and to listen for the best and right direction, not merely relying on the superficial form of Friends’ business practice, but honoring these as structures that give space and dignity for decisions that are obedient to what is true, above what we want either collectively or individually. While some members recognise the Divine as the root of our seeking, and others do not, we respect worship, and non-worship, in all forms. We value a diversity of perspectives in all things because we strive to be open to the truths that may come from any voice among us.

We hold education as a core mission of this community. As witnessed by the best work of the Meeting School, education extends well beyond the classroom. Learning should not be limited to any age; truth can arise anywhere; and any of us can be the student, any of us the teacher. The best education is place-based, attuned to natural cycles and wisdom, and serves to cultivate and empower a stronger, more thoughtful, responsible, cooperatively-minded citizenry. We commit to being open to the sharing of ideas and knowledge within and beyond this community, and, as we are able, to supporting educational projects or enterprises that might arise within our membership.
Furthermore, as a group, we recognise the inevitable limitations of our small residential community; we value wisdom from outside of our immediate membership, and commit to seeking expertise and support from outside of our community that will help us better live into all aspects of our mission.</description>

Our orientation is as a service oriented group of workers dedicated at helping ourselves; each other, humanity and ultimately the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/oblate-community-of-st-paul-iocu/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/oblate-community-of-st-paul-iocu/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Oblate Community of St Paul-IOCU was formed in 1968 by our Reverend, Dr. George Freibott IV, ND, MD(H).  Dr. Freibott was the President and Lifelong Trustee of the American Naturopathic Association (ANA) in New York and Washington D.C., and Idaho (IDANA).  The original ANA was founded in the late 1800s by Dr. Benedict Lust.  An oblate community is a community of like-minded people, families and singles, dedicated to the common purpose of &quot;feeding the hungry, clothing the naked and healing the sick&quot;. Our community is faith-based, nondenominational and service oriented dedicated to helping each other and ultimately the planet. We are students (Oblates) of Naturopathy with a common belief in healing with nature rather than chemicals and invasive surgeries.  We support ourselves by manufacturing a line of products called &quot;Oxygen Therapies Blass.&quot;  Our main product is a nutritional product called &quot;Homozon&quot; developed by Dr. Eugene Blass in the early 20th Century.  Homozon works to detox and cleanse the cells of the body and floods the  body with oxygen.  Dr. Freibott endorsed www.liveoxygen.com as an informational site to inform the public of our products..</description>

We seek to be renewed as a cooperative neighborhood through celebration and interaction, while at the same time we respect and give space to the life and individuality that members have beyond cohousing. We strive to relate beyond our physical space and Association and to intergrate and interact comfortably and responsibly with the surrrounding neighborhoods, city and region.

Our guiding principles include elements of: process, design, accessibility, ecology, common facilities, diversity, decision making, structure/management and &quot;getting things done&quot; (active participation).</description>

      <name>Lovare Homestead</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22597&quot;&gt;Lovare Homestead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Lovare Homestead is being created to bring community back into the big picture by focusing on producing organically grown food and educational experiences for the locals in our area. It’s a group based farm and living acreage for homes in De Graff, Ohio (about 50 minutes from both Columbus and Dayton). Lovare will be open to hosting a stable group of 6 tiny houses year round. Each of the houses will be on the Lovare board. After showing their commitment to Lovare, we’d like them to live on the land like it’s their own and possibly even owning a share in the homestead. After many meetings with the local government, we have been legally approved for both tiny houses built on wheels and on foundation. 
We want this to be home to a group of people who have chosen to live together with a common purpose, working cooperatively to create a lifestyle that reflects their shared core values. Our core values are sustainability, ecology, self-sufficiency, recycling, composting, permaculture, organic gardening, grey water systems, reducing our carbon footprint and incorporating community into daily lives. We’d like to have a community barn, organic garden and orchard, six tiny home sites, chickens and goats. If one of our board members has a passion, we’d love to come together to make it happen for them at Lovare homestead. 

In addition to all of this, Lovare Homestead aims to have a big outreach to local and like-minded communities around the country. We hope to have open farm days for our seasoned farming friends, families, and ever-expanding circles of  enthusiastic newbies in our surrounding area to come out to the homestead.  We'd like to actively engage with the community by sharing labor, meals, knowledge, and belly laughs.  At Lovare Homestead, we think it’s very important to teach others the how-tos instead of doing things for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/tiny-house-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/tiny-house-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a Tiny House community. The master plan is to have 6 tiny houses at Lovare. We have a few spots remaining and are accepting applications.</description>

      <name>Listening Tree Cooperative</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22598&quot;&gt;Listening Tree Cooperative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We intend to regenerate community as we consciously choose to create a more sustainable way of life. We will experiment with self-organizing social systems at this time of energy descent, particularly in egalitarian ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/listening-tree-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/listening-tree-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a small group that has just started a green cooperative homestead in Chepachet, RI. Two of us  purchased a farm in June 2015, and are currently leasing it to the cooperative. When we find enough members and the co-op decides to purchase it, the owners will sell the property to the coop. 

In order to balance the need for and efficiencies of community with the need for solitude and privacy, we are creating small, cabin-like shelters (including retrofitting existing outbuildings) for sleeping and other alone-time activities. We share one kitchen, and cooperatively prepare and serve dinner in the shared house to all residents on site each evening. The house also contains shared office/farm-work space, bathrooms, other sleeping rooms and a convertible guest room/yoga studio/meeting room. At this point, we envision a community of 10-15 residents will live on the farm eventually. The current septic allowance for this property is 10 people. 

Key features include:

    Regular community meetings and conflict prevention and resolution/management processes;
    A participatory democratic decision-making process, with ‘sense of the group’ practices leading up to final decisions, the N Street method for contentious issues, and a “consensus minus one” decision rule;
    Simple living, energy conservation and material cycling (e.g., compost toilets, rainwater capture, passive solar and super-insulated (e.g. passive house) buildings and renewable energy systems);
    Growing food for the community (and others when excess), using sustainable farming, such as organic methods, permaculture, and wild-simulation propogation. Three market-farm partners currently share the site, with areas designated for them and for the co-op residents' homesteading garden and animals and food forest;
    New resident screening process and trial period;
    Opportunities for agreed-upon community mind/body/spirit practice and also an acceptance of a variety of individual practices (yoga, meditation, prayer, etc.) or none;
    Sharing responsibilities and work of the homestead, honoring the particular skills members bring to the community as well as sharing basic chores, etc.
    Sharing many things, such as meals, a truck, appliances, kitchen, laundry, bathrooms, etc., to conserve resources and make community living more affordable than single-family housing. However, this is not an income-sharing community. Private ownership of cars and personal effects will be allowed and rules for borrowing established by each individual.
    The cooperative as a whole will own and share the common house, barn, appliances, solar power equipment, tractor, many tools, etc. Rules about sharing will be developed through the group decision making process (see above).
    A market farmer or farm family could buy a special share that designates a portion of the arable land for market farming, to be stewarded by the farmer(s) in a land tenure contract with the housing cooperative. See below for details.

Our community aspires to provide educational service to the state and beyond. We will promote and conduct workshops (e.g. deep ecology – the ‘Work that Reconnects’ – workshops, a permaculture charette) and host apprentices who will live with us for a summer or semester to learn community life, food and shelter provision and about local/global transition to sustainable living more generally. We may choose to partner with an existing nonprofit organization to help raise money, recruit apprentices, and provide high school or college credit.

We plan to ensure affordability and equality by setting up ownership as a limited equity co-operative. A limited equity co-op is an alternative legal ownership entity which allows people to buy into the property and own shares of the co-op and thereby be given rights to live there and use designated and shared space for living and working, while keeping equity earned at the level paid in vs. market price. This removes investment/speculation from housing and keeps it affordable in perpetuity. Purchasing or financing a share grants holders the right to live in and otherwise use the land and structures, but also to transfer this right by selling their share back to the coop. Unlike a condo, the co-op community has the right to vet new members when shares are transferred.</description>

These values are central and necessary to everything we do. We believe that with these values as the foundation of our culture, we will be able to pursue our group goals, which we have identified as wellness, growth, curiosity, creation and creativity, real food, celebration, community, and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/fiasco-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/fiasco-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;FIASCO! is the newest branch of a 50+ year collective history. We're proud to be the latest manifestation of a long lineage of rad co-ops, including Bob the House (Seattle), Even Worse House (Olympia), and Cherry Hill MDA (Boston). 

FIASCO! began in July 2014, and embraced the name when one of the founding members shared the word's supposed etymology. As the legend goes, &quot;fiasco&quot; comes from an old Italian word for &quot;flask.&quot; When glassblowers made wine bottles they had to be perfectly shaped so the bottles could stack and store well. However, sometimes the bottles didn’t turn out quite right. Instead of scrapping the problem bottles, they molded them into flasks, turning a potential disaster into a vibrant work of art. FIASCO! (Disclaimer, we don't know how much truth there is in this, but we sure like the story!)</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22603&quot;&gt;Wheelock Mountain Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To support local, regional, and global non-violent activism and to sustainably steward the land on which we live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/wheelock-mountain-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/wheelock-mountain-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Wheelock Mountain Farm is a non-profit education center and intentional community situated on 650 acres in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont.  All but 22 of the acres are held in Trust to protect them in perpetuity from development.  The land was donated to the non-profit in 1996 with the intention that it become a popular education resource center to empower people to take non-violent action in pursuit of social, racial, economic, and environmental justice.  To this end, Wheelock Mountain Farm has been collaborating with activist groups from around the region and from around the world—regularly organizing and hosting convergences, retreats, meetings, skillshares, naturalist programs and camps for the last 20 years.  We steward the land responsibly--preserving it as a refuge for people and wildlife, and cultivating it to help sustain our programs and residents.

Wheelock Mountain Farm is a 501(c)3 that utilizes a consensus decision-making process.  The Board is comprised of both resident and non-resident activists and educators.  Most day-to-day work and decision-making is done at the household level, and residents hold weekly dinner meetings to make plans, delegate tasks, and coordinate logistical follow through while the Board deals primarily with the programmatic aspects of the farm.  It is a balance built on long held mutual trust and respect.

Members of Wheelock Mountain Farm are active in a variety of organizations in the area including The Buffalo Mountain Food Coop, The Swap Sisters, Rising Tide Vermont, Vermont Yankee Decommissioning Alliance, and Migrant Justice.  Residents meet their monetary needs, including paying rent to Wheelock Mountain Farm, in a variety of ways--teaching, farming, developing programming at the local library, administrating an alternative healing practitioners' office, and co-directing an international non-profit focused on children.

Wheelock Mountain Farm's land includes a 300+ tap sugarbush, a 100+ acre pond with nearly undeveloped shoreline, large parcels of mixed hard and softwood forest, 12 acres of pasture, and one of the finest Northern White Cedar swamps in the state.  We have 2 four season homes with one more currently under construction, a three season cabin for long term guests/interns, a beautiful stone house/dormitory to accommodate shorter term summer guests, a greenhouse, and a small barn.

We are currently in the process of expanding our programs and number of residents in order to better fulfill our mission.</description>

We foster a framework for creation and growth by connecting our members to each other and to the local community. Come grow with GRACC!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/james-russell-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/james-russell-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We provide cooperative communal housing in downtown Grand Rapids, with an emphasis on affordability and openness to alternative lifestyles. Shared work, group meals and innovation are hallmarks of this mode of intentional living. Through consensus-based decision making, the members establish systems to meet their basic needs collectively within each house and elect representatives to manage the affairs of the organization.

The initial group first formed as the Grand Rapids Dining Cooperative, which met for regular dinners in each other’s homes. Inspired by housing cooperatives in Austin, Ann Arbor and elsewhere, members of the dining coop leased the property at 535 Fulton St E in 2012, starting what would become the James Russell House.

This group of co-opers incorporated as the Grand Rapids Alliance of Cooperative Communities in 2012, and has since started cooperatives at three more locations. GRACC currently provides housing for approximately 50 individuals.</description>

      <name>OIKOS INTENTIONAL COMMUNITY</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22606&quot;&gt;OIKOS INTENTIONAL COMMUNITY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Oikos Intentional Community has at the core of its mission service to the poorest of the poor and homeless. Discipleship and following Christ in the most authentic way is the intention. We do not seek to convert, but rather to love and serve other, denying ourselves daily and picking up our cross and following Christ.

The Oikos Intentional Community embraces Christian Naturism and hold nude meditation and nude baptismal services.

A WORD ON NUDE BAPTISM FROM OUR DASA

Nude baptism is as old as the time of the Christ. Like nude meditation, nude baptism brings us into oneness with the Elohim and allows us to do as Jesus commanded when He told us not to conform to the world.

I want to outline how this practice is instituted at our Oikos Intentional Community.

Just prior to entering the water the oikourgous (Oikos members, literally meaning keeper of the house.) remove their clothes, for the baptism is received nude.


In the baptism of a oikourgous, the Dasa anoints the forehead, pronounces the formula, and dips the head, then anoints the body with oil and washes the feet of the newly baptized. In the case of women being baptized, a female elder anoints the body and receives the woman as she came out of the water. The Dasa washes her feet.

The nudity expresses the idea of new birth- hence in art the baptizand is shown not only nude but smaller than the baptizer. This manner of representation is not an indication of infant or child baptism but follows artistic convention. The newly baptized person put on a white garment, symbolizing purity

Early Christians were baptized nude and it is highly likely Jesus Himself was baptized nude. One aspect of the symbolism of nakedness was the comparison of Christ, designated as “the second Adam” (see Romans 5:14, 1 Corinthians 15:22,45), with the first Adam prior to The Fall:

   St. Chrysostom, speaking of baptism, says, “Men were naked as Adam in paradise; but with this difference; Adam was naked because he had sinned, but in baptism, a man was naked that he might be freed from sin; the one was divested of his glory which he once had, but the other put off the old man, which he did as easily as his clothes.”


   St. Ambrose says, “Men came as naked to the font, as they came into the world; and thence he draws an argument by way of illusion, to rich men, telling them, how absurd it was, that a man was born naked of his mother, and received naked by the church, should think of going rich into heaven.”

   Cyril of Jerusalem takes notice of the circumstance, together with the reasons of it, when he thus addresses himself to persons newly baptized: “As soon as ye came into the inner part of the baptistry, ye put off your clothes, which is an emblem of putting off the old man with his deeds; and being thus di

vested, ye stood naked, imitating Christ, that was naked upon the cross, who by his nakedness spoiled principalities and powers, publicly triumphing over them in the cross. O wonderful thing! ye were naked, imitating the first Adam, that was naked in paradise, and was not ashamed.”

   So also Amphilochius in the Life of St. Basil, speaking of his baptism, says, “He arose with fear and put off his clothes, and with them the old man… “(Institutes of Biblical Law, p. 758, Presbyterian &amp; Reformed Publishing, 1973).

BY THE REVEREND DASA WILLIAM GRIFFITH OF THE OIKOS COMMUNITY


    																				
  

OPEN AND AFFIRMING

Oikos Intentional Community does not hold the mainstream views about sexuality that the traditional church holds. We are an open and affirming community, welcoming LGBT members. We have a positive view of both sexuality and nudity, and believe the culture and society in which we live has polluted these two wonderful gifts from God. While our society promotes violence, pornography, war as acceptable parts of our culture, that same society views sexuality and nudity as negative elements. This is where society has it wrong. We teach our members how to empower themselves spiritual and lead them into their Oneness with God, their creator, who created us in His image. Our Dasa, Rev. William Griffith believes in studying the mysteries of God as they were intended and believes our lifestyle should reflect simplicy in a wealth driven culture, while promoting the natural beauty that God has bestowed upon humanity. The community is also engaged in social justice, meeting the needs of the homeless and poorest of the poor on the streets, as well as challenging the contemporary pharisees in our churches today.

OUR RULE AND RHYTHM OF LIFE

“Ordered Members” of the Oikos Intentional Community share the common Rhythm of Life by ordering their lives according to the  Oikos Community Rule of Life.
http://www.oikos.community/#!oikos-rule-of-life/c1x7n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/oikos-intentional-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/oikos-intentional-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Oikos Intentional Community is a new monastic community focused on discipleship, common living and serving in the abandoned places of our cities among the homeless and poorest of the poor. Oikos adheres to the 12 Marks of New Monasticism, in addition to others vows of poverty chastity, obedience and humility. Vows depend upon the individual's calling and not mandatory. Observing the 12 Marks is essential. Oikos life resembles that of the early Christians. The leader of the community, our 'Dasa' (meaning servant, slave of...) has taken extreme vows of poverty, chastity and obedience and has chosen to wear a simple dhoti, sandals and a shawl. Community members are to dress simply and as casually as possible.  

ABOUT SUNFLOWER VILLAGE

The Sunflower Village project will be the first residential new monastic community of Oikos to be founded by Reverend Dasa William Griffith.

Sunflower Village is where Dasa has had a vision of building a new monastic Community of Love: creating a healthy, nourishing environment where people can learn the art of living in harmony with one another and with the Earth.

Sunflower Village is intended to be a small, rustic farmstead, and will house a new monastic monastery, It is a continuation and housing facility of the Oikos Intentional Community.

At SunflowerVillage we weave mindfulness into all our daily activities, training ourselves to be mindful throughout the day: while eating, walking, working, or enjoying a cup of coffee or tea together. The practice of Christian Naturism is a fixture of the  Village, and will be a beautiful, nourishing, simple environment in which to cultivate the mind of awakening.

As we do at Oikos, we enjoy periods of silence, sitting meditation, rest, relaxation, mindful work and play. All practitioners who come to Sunflower Village will be invited to join in the communal activities,, whether it is preparing meals, cleaning or washing dishes, as a way of learning to cultivate joy and mindfulness whatever we are doing.

Every year, Sunflower Village will welcome thousands of meditation practitioners from all around the world who come to experience the art of mindful communal living, regardless of religious affiliation or their individual faith systems. The Village will also host an annual Summer Retreat which offers special programs for all who attend.

A committee has been established by Dasa for the location of the land in California to make Sunflower Village our home.

ABOUT THE SUNFLOWER ROSARY

The 1st Dasa of the Oikos Intentional Community commissioned the oikourgous (ordered members at Oikos) to begin making Sunflower Rosaries for those belonging to the community and also for the outside world. The Dasa believes prayer beads are a positive meditative tool for focus and contemplation, and developed the Sunflower Rosary for his new monastics.

WHY THE SUNFLOWER?

The Dasa chose the Sunflower for the name of the rosary because the Sunflower means “adoration, loyalty and longevity”. We desire to communicate with God and to draw closer to God because of our adoration of God.  We vow loyalty to God and desire to serve our Master for our length of years.

Gifts of radiant warmth, sunflowers are the happiest of flowers, representing our joy as new monastics. They are unique in their ability to provide energy in the form of nourishment and vibrance, an attribute which mirrors the sun and the energy provided by its heat and light. Our Dasa teaches the importance of spiritual energy, derived from our disciplines in harnessing our emotional and sexual energy for nourishment of the Spirit.

No flower can lift spirits quite like sunflowers can. Bright and cheery, bold yet comfortable, the sunflower is a warm and caring gift. With brilliant yellow petals that surround the flower’s center, sunflowers have an unmistakable sun-like appearance that has made them a passionate flower choice for many. Sunflowers come in a number of varieties, ranging from small to large and from daylight yellows to sunset reds.

Sunflowers originated in the Americas in 1000B.C., where for centuries they were cultivated as a valuable food source. The use of sunflower images as religious symbols has also been documented in some native societies. With the European exploration of the New World, the sunflower was brought to new areas, and the flower’s popularity eventually spread as the rest of the world began to appreciate its beauty and sustenance. Artists throughout history have appreciated the sunflower’s unique splendor, and those of the Impressionist era were especially fixated on the flower. Today, sunflowers continue to provide a resource for commonly used seeds and oil, but they have also become recognized as a floral symbol of great significance.

Much of the meaning of sunflowers stems from its namesake, the sun itself. Wild sunflowers are often photographed with their tall stalks and bright petals stretched towards the sun. This unique behavior, known as phototropism, is a motif that has appeared in many ancient myths and is viewed as a symbol of loyalty and constancy. Their physical resemblance to the sun has also influenced their meanings. The sunflower’s petals have been likened to bright yellow rays of sunshine, which evoke feelings of warmth and happiness. In addition, the sunflower is often associated with adoration and longevity.

For a flower which reflects so many of the sun’s positive characteristics, it is little surprise that people enjoy basking in the sunflower’s warming glow. With the sense of brightness and warmth that sunflowers naturally impart, they have become an ideal choice for sending sentiments of cheerfulness and sunny get well thoughts.

The sunflower is really a collection of 1,000 to 2,000 tiny flowers arranged in an intricate pattern that creates a reproductive opportunity for the plant. This fact represents “community as a whole”. Ray florets are flowers with long, straplike petals along the outside of the sunflower. Each petal on the outside of a sunflower is a flower. Disc florets are the flowers tightly clustered together inside the ray florets. The ray florets are unable to reproduce by themselves because they are missing one or more sex organs. The disc florets possess both male and female reproductive organs. This represents God as both male and female, and how we were created in the image of God with both male and female in each of us.

Perfect and Imperfect

Perfect flowers have male and female reproductive organs, which are the stamen and pistil, respectively. Imperfect flowers are missing one of those organs and, therefore, cannot pollinate themselves. Self-pollination is not necessary for a sunflower plant to reproduce, but it makes it simpler for the plant to accomplish fertilization by wind or insect. A sunflower relies on bees and other insects to help move pollen around its head to each flower. Butterflies and other insects often perch on an upturned sunflower head because its large, flat surface is inviting to insects searching for nectar.

Complete and Incomplete

Complete flowers have all four floral organs. The floral organs consist of sepals, which are small, green, leaflike structures at the base of petals; petals, which are the colorful part of the flower; female sex organs, including the ovary and ovule, which together are called the pistil; and the male sex organs, including the pollen-producing anthers, which together are called the stamen. If a flower is missing any of those parts, it is incomplete but still could be considered perfect. If, for example, a flower is missing sepals but has male and female reproductive organs, it would be a perfect flower; because not all four floral organs are present, however, the flower is also incomplete. Sunflower ray florets are missing both stamen and pistil, making them sterile. Sunflower disc florets are perfect flowers and create fruit when fertilized. That fruit is sunflower seed.

Sunflowers are used for their seeds, meal, oil and foliage as well as for the beneficial properties they provide when grown alongside other crops. The Oikos Intentional Community also grows sunflowers for their seeds and oil.

Health benefits of sunflower seeds

   Delicious, nutty, and crunchy sunflower seeds are widely considered as healthful foods. They are high in energy; 100 g seeds hold about 584 calories. Nonetheless, they are one of the incredible sources of health benefiting nutrients, minerals, antioxidants and vitamins.

   Much of their calories come from fatty acids. The seeds are especially rich in poly-unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid, which constitute more 50% fatty acids in them. They are also good in mono-unsaturated oleic acid that helps lower LDL or “bad cholesterol” and increases HDL or “good-cholesterol” in the blood. Research studies suggest that Mediterranean diet which is rich in monounsaturated fats help to prevent coronary artery disease, and stroke by favoring healthy blood lipid profile.

   Like other nuts, they are also a very good source of proteins with fine quality amino acids such as tryptophan that are essential for growth, especially in children. Just 100 g of seeds provide about 21 g of protein (37% of daily-recommended values).

   In addition, sunflower seeds contain health benefiting poly-phenol compounds such as chlorogenic acid, quinic acid, and caffeic acids. These compounds are natural anti-oxidants, which help remove harmful oxidant molecules from the body. Further, chlorogenic acid helps reduce blood sugar levels by limiting glycogen breakdown in the liver.

   Further, the seeds are indeed a very rich source of vitamin E; contain about 35.17 g per100 g (about 234% of RDA). Vitamin E is a powerful lipid soluble antioxidant, required for maintaining the integrity of cell membrane of mucus membranes and skin by protecting it from harmful oxygen-free radicals.

   Sunflower kernels are one of the finest sources of B-complex group of vitamins. They are very good sources of B-complex vitamins such as niacin, folic acid, thiamin (vitamin B1), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), pantothenic acid, and riboflavin.

   Sunflowers are incredible sources of folic acid. 100 g of kernels contains 227 µg of folic acid,which is about 37% of recommended daily intake. Folic acid is essential for DNA synthesis. When given in anticipant mothers during the peri-conceptional period, it may prevent neural tube defects in the baby.

   Niacin and pyridoxine are other B-complex vitamins found abundantly in the sunflower seeds. About 8.35 mg or 52% of daily-required levels of niacin is provided by just 100 g of seeds. Niacin helps reduce LDL-cholesterol levels in the blood. In addition, it enhances GABA activity inside the brain, which in turn helps reduce anxiety and neurosis.

   The seeds are incredibly rich sources of many essential minerals. Calcium, iron, manganese, zinc, magnesium, selenium, and copper are especially concentrated in sunflower seeds. Many of these minerals play a vital role in bone mineralization, red blood cell production, enzyme secretion, hormone production, as well as in the regulation of cardiac and skeletal muscle activities.

Just a hand full of sunflower kernels a day provides much of the recommended level of phenolic anti-oxidants, minerals, vitamins, and protein.

HOW TO SAY THE SUNFLOWER ROSARY

The Sunflower Rosary is a contemplative prayer form. It is a modern prayer forumula developed by the Dasa, combining the Roman Catholic Rosary with the Orthodox Jesus Prayer Rope. It is comprised of 33 beads (the traditional number of years of Jesus’ life). There is one “INVITATORY” bead followed by four sets of seven beads each (called “stamen”) with a single bead (called the “pistil” bead) in between each Parakaleo. In the Judeo-Christian tradition the number seven is that of spiritual perfection and completion. The circle of beads is prayed, unhurriedly, three times to signify the Holy Trinity. This makes for ninety-nine prayers, and in Middle Eastern traditions, 99 is the complete number of the Divine Names. Rather than a crucifix or a cross, a Sunflower charm or tassel hangs from the beads. If you include the FLOWER at the beginning or the end, this brings the total number of prayers said to 100, which is the total of the Orthodox Rosary and represents the fullness of creation. Typically the saying of the Rosary is followed by a period of silence for reflection.

There are no set prayers for the Sunflower Rosary. It is your choice! You may also use the Dasa’s Prayers from the Salos or develop your own prayers for the stamen section of the rosary.

Listed below is the method of using the beads and some of the more commonly used prayers. Remember, it is the practice that is important, the time spent in communion with God; the rosary is simply the vehicle for getting there. It is a tool for meditation, contemplation and spiritual focus.

HOW TO USE YOUR BEADS

1)         Loosely hold the beads in your hand, grasping the cross in your other hand. If desired, say your opening prayer.

2)         With your thumb and forefinger, grasp the pistil bead and say your chosen pistil prayer.

3)         Move your fingers up the chain to the first of the 4  beads and say your chosen prayer.

4)         Move your fingers up the chain to the first set of stamen  to the right (you will be saying the rosary in a counterclockwise direction). Grasp the first bead and say your chosen prayer for the weeks. Repeat this prayer on the next six beads.

5)         Move your fingers to the next pistil bead and say your chosen pistil prayer.

6)         Continue in this manner until you have completed the circle of the rosary.

Guide us waking O Lord, and guard us sleeping; that awake we may watch with Christ and asleep we may rest in peace.

Or

Behold now, bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord. You that stand in the house of the Lord, lift up your hands in the holy place and bless the Lord.

Or

Holy God, Holy and Mighty Master, Holy Immortal One, Have mercy upon us, your slaves.

THE STAMEN

Almighty and merciful Lord, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, bless us and keep us. Amen.

Or

Naked Christ, lamb of God, have mercy on us.

Naked Christ, bearer of our sins, have mercy on us.

Naked Christ, redeemer of the world, give us your peace.

Or

I lift up my eyes to the hills; from where is my help to come?

My help comes from the Lord, the make of heaven and earth.

Or

Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, Have mercy on me, a sinner.

THE JOURNEY OF THE DASA

There is a period of time between the choosing of the dasa at the Oikos Intentional Community and his actual investiture. 

When Reverend William Griffith became the 1st Dasa of Oikos, he took his vows, donned nothing but a simple dhoti and began preparing for his investiture through meditation, prayer and service. Chosen March 31, 2015, he shaved his entire body, signed a contract of submission with his prioress and was invested by anointing as the 1st Dasa in an official ceremony April 18, 2015.


In the Oikos Intentional Community, the spiritual leader is known as the DASA (&quot; meaning slave/servant in Sanskrit&quot;).   The dasa is solely dedicated to achieving perpetual spiritual enlightenment ),  through meditation and contemplation. . The dasa wears a simple dhoti as a sign of his poverty. He/she renounces all material goods. Being dasa is open to women; since God is both male and female. The dasa is meant to be an extreme example of servitude and enslavement to the Elohim.



BECOMING DASA


The processes of becoming the dasa were establshed in the Constitution and Bylaws of the Oikos Intentional Community. The rituals following his/her selection include meditation one month prior to the investiture. Before the investiture, the dasa shaves his/her head and body, including his eyebrows, to accent the androgynous character of the Elohim (the masculine/feminine name of God). The dasa must continue this practice as a sign of submission and obedience. It makes the dasa sexless and androgynous. They must also be naturists. The investiture is done with the dasa naked. He/she is anointed with oil and is given the title &quot;The Reverend Dasa&quot;.

Extreme vows are taken for life by the Dasa:

POVERTY

CHASTITY (Celibacy)

OBEDIENCE

SILENCE (For a designated time)


A person who becomesa dasa must seek a pioress or prior before the investiture. There, he or she must sign a contract with the prior/prioress (who serves as physical and spiritual master of the dasa). The prioress/prior is in charge of excercising disciplines to build the extreme vows of the dasa. The dasa is in total submission to the prioress/prior for life and to God. The prioress/prior has earthly authority over the dasa and is charged with keeping him/her in a state of perpetual submission and obedience. This build the character of the dasa's vows.  

Living as the dasa is meant to be a difficult lifestyle. Dasas are considered to be dead unto themselves, and legally dead to the world.

While the life of renunciation is described by the Christ in the gospels, the dasa must live witrh little, including minor portions of food. The dasa must be blessed with knowledge of the esoteric mysteries and use all energy, physical, emotional, mental and sexual energy for spiritual empowerment. The dasa must perform dity and mundane tasks for the community, like douing dishes, scrubbing floors, cleaning the community toilets. These activities, and there are many, are acts of meditation, worship and prayer for the dasa.

The Dasa is to never to be seen as divine, and nothing more than a slave-teacher. What knowledge and insight he/she has is from God. The dasa must routinely wash the feet of the oikourgous (Oikos new monastics) and serve them as slave. The prioress/prior assigns tasks to all of the oikourgous in the community, including the dasa.

The ruggedness of the dasa life deters those who are not enlightened. The practices are rigorous, such as the renouncing of all material goods and a detachment from common luxuries.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22607&quot;&gt;Jesus People USA (JPUSA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We strive to be Christ's light both in each others' lives and in our community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/jesus-people-usa-jpusa/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/jesus-people-usa-jpusa/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;“I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.”
― Mother Teresa

In 1972, JPUSA began when a ragtag group of Christians wanted to change the world for Jesus. Now more than forty years later, they are still at it. What started as simply inviting folks in for a meal became a feeding program. What began as a phone call from a mother looking for housing eventually became a shelter, and now a complex of ministries dedicated to housing and resource services. Working together, ordinary people have been able to accomplish extraordinary things.

“Many people are good at talking about what they are doing, but in fact do little. Others do a lot but don’t talk about it; they are the ones who make a community live.”
― Jean Vanier, Community And Growth

In the 21st Century, community makes more sense than ever. By pooling resources, we use fewer resources. We at JPUSA have heard a call from God to reach Chicago’s inner city and beyond with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Perhaps JPUSA’s most important benefit is helping each member grow and mature in the Christian faith through an environment of Christian fellowship, pastoral care, biblical teaching, and practical work either through our tent-making businesses or through our various outreaches to the “least of these.”

“ ‘For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me. . . Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’ ”
― Matthew 25:35, 36, 45</description>

Our basic core values consist of permaculture, family, and close friendships.  We also don't conform to any one religion, or even world view...other than we need to take care of the world around us.  You can get to know us online in our regular global webcam meetings, and transition to Serra Grande when ready.  Those of us in Brazil have found prime land and are currently closing on several small parcels of a 108 hectare property.

Our members include LGBT couples and singles, straight couples and singles, still working and retirees (and our pets).

We have 15 beautiful acres in progressive Durham, NC and will soon begin construction on the accessible, single-level neighborhood that we planned with the guidance of Katie McCamant and Charles Durrett. Only a few homes are still available and we are so pleased with the way our community has come together. Our members are committed to mutual support and bring a wide variety of skills and interests to share.

We look forward to eating the food grown in our gardens, building things to enhance our homes and community in the woodworking shop and the art studios, going on hikes, bicycle rides, and kayaking trips at the many nearby natural areas (including access to North Carolina’s Mountain to the Sea trail directly from our land), staying fit in the exercise room, meditating in our woods, or just enjoying each other’s company on our front porches and common house terrace.

Finally picking up momentum and VERY excited about it!

1) We're currently establishing a group residence in Eagle Rock.  We've currently consolidated our group to two houses in the same neighborhood.

2) Our next step will be to stabilize a group fund which will go towards purchasing property.  This is being done through a combination of personal endeavors, group projects, and fund raising events.

3)  Once our financial goal is reached we will reevaluate and determine whether we will first buy a house in Los Angeles or buy rural property elsewhere(the ultimate goal is to buy the rural property regardless of whether we buy an urban/suburban house or not).

4)  We will purchase a piece of land that will be shared among all members of the community.  There we will establish our final residence where we can farm our own food, build our own society, and finally feel comfortable having and raising children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-lab/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-lab/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a family.  Perhaps one can better refer to us as a tribe.

We usually all spend our Friday evenings together either working on projects, discussing philosophy, sharing meals, spending quality time together.  We host regular meetings that anyone is welcome to attend; Tuesday night open lab(where we build solar panels, mesh networks, etc), Thursday night discussion meetings(where we usually discuss philosophy), Sunday morning art classes(figure drawing/painting, etc), and many other events in between(Including a monthly dinner outing to get to know one another).

We're working towards establishing our community one step at a time through a series of community building events and fund raisers.

We are part of a larger local intentional community of loosely interconnected community homes, families and individuals, which is spiritual in nature and aims at co-creating more consciousness in self and others.  We choose to live together for many varied and personal reasons of course, but some things we have in common are: building healthy connections and relationships; exploring the behavioural patterns learned in our families of origin, learning how they still affect our relating and relationships today, and supporting each other in making conscious choices to learn new behaviours which will support us in living happier healthier lives as emotionally mature adults.  To help us to do this we have certain guidelines that we follow in our day-to-day interactions with each other.  We have weekly house meetings in which we co-create and share a meal, resolve household logistics, and share our emotional processes in ways that are uplifting to all.

We are creating a multi-generational home space together in rural northern California.  Here, we are intentionally building a culture expressing our consensed-upon values, which include: sustainability, love, sharing, clear communication, an empowered work ethic, sex-positivity, and fun.  We are choosing to continually experiment with new solutions to provide sustainably for human material and emotional needs.
	We govern ourselves through weekly meetings, in which all are welcome to speak, and major decisions are finally made by consensus of the partner members.  These Councils ensure regular coordination of our projects, and all visitors are expected to attend and invited to participate.  We also have a heartsong circle, usually monthly, which fosters deep, honest communication.  All four of the current adults are polyamorous, and we welcome everyone.   The land is owned by our mutual benefit nonprofit corporation.  Each resident chooses projects to manage, for example, we currently have managers for the water (mountain spring-fed), the power (hydroelectric &amp; solar), the goats, the kitchen, and equipment maintenance.
	There are few structures on the land, which is mostly undeveloped, so it is best for visitors to be prepared to camp.  The land is mostly steep and rocky, relatively impassable for individuals with serious mobility issues.  We use little power, and phone lines don't reach us, but we do have limited Internet access.  Together, we have built a well-stocked community kitchen, but visitors, like residents, are expected to provide a portion of their own food.  Economic opportunities are limited in this town, so bring your own initial income stream.  We mostly shop in Redding, which is a 90-minute drive away on a clear day.  There is only one small general store in our town which has two or three hundred residents.  Also, this river-side town has natural hot springs, a permaculture-based community land trust, a community club, and an excellent elementary/middle school.
	We acknowledge a healthy community's dependence on the mingling of many generations.  We're welcoming individuals and families of every variety who are excited about the puzzle of crafting a permaculture oasis out of raw land.  We want people to commit to our diverse projects, including administration, construction, unschooling the children, operation and maintenance of heavy equipment, agricultural husbandry such as chickens, bees, mushrooms, and multi-layered gardening, et cetera.  If these are not areas you are experienced in, we want you, too!  If you consider yourself creative, considerate, reliable, and flexible, and willing to communicate openly, then come visit us and see if our home could become your home, too.</description>

We have decided to &quot;opt-out&quot; and create a safer, healthier, and happier life for our children. To that end we are seeking like-minded families to join together in an effort to create an off grid, self sufficient, sustainable community. This is a ground floor opportunity for those interested in being part of forming a new community.

We are currently located in Kentucky but are very open minded for the final location as long as it makes sense (climate, growing season, etc.). The final decision on the location will be a group effort. Our vision is to purchase a plot of land as a land trust with each family having their own home site and the balance of the land being used to growing crops, raising animals, and preservation. </description>

We want to create a healthy example of how a community can work together and share our earth, for families who need, want, and are willing to work for a brighter future, a stable home, and a strong community. What we offer is unique because we will be using new technology, strongly encouraging people to follow their passion, and focusing on building strong ties between our community members.
We are seeking interested community members to create intentional community in the area, perhaps through the purchase of land.  Concept: Unique natural-built homes each with their own 2 acres to grow crops, raise animals, and create their vision. We are still looking at locations, but one that we like is in nearby Westwater, Utah, a great value situated on the Colorado River, with a beautiful sandstone bluff, a well, and power already.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22619&quot;&gt;Family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Looking to create a loving, trusting, stable, life long family.  A family to laugh with and cry with along the journey. People to share in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/family/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/family/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Specifically  I am searching to find: A female or two who love children and want more than anything to be at home caring for our precious young. A male or two who also want to maintain and support the home for the sake of the cause.I am currently buying a home in a quite neighborhood in small town Indiana. The house has five bedrooms, three bathrooms and two kitchens. The basement could easily be upgraded to facilitate more rooms. The house is in need of a handyman but is cute and had potential. It sits on 3/4ths acer and is in a generally wooded area.
If you have children and haven't quite established the solid home and family you were wanting, this might be just right for you. This would be a family who shares a close living space with choirs, meals, and activities.</description>

This is an exceptional opportunity to learn and engage alongside our Lakota-trained shaman and natural healing practitioner(s). For guidelines and regitation, please visit our website at www.muaisa.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/muaisa-hale-pule-as-i-aum-sanctuary/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/muaisa-hale-pule-as-i-aum-sanctuary/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;An authorized 501(c)(3) chapter of the New Haven Native American Church (NHNAC), we do not engage in commerce. Instead, we rely on donations and volunteerism for all our services.

At our cedarwood lodge in Kealakekua, Hawaii, we provide several venues of counseling, natural healing, and training for those who seek to renew their energy levels, revitalize their perspectives on life, experience an entirely new state of being, and get in touch with their divine life purpose.

Long- and short-term involvements are available to guests and volunteers interested in personal growth and natural healing, and to those who welcome the opportunity to live in harmony with the island's natural surroundings. This is ideal for anyone who enjoys being of service, is willing to learn about and practice eco-sustainability, and finds joy and fulfillment in personal growth and physical, emotional, mental and spiritual development. 

Situated at 19.5 degrees North latitude in Kealakekua, the general area is located 3 miles (6 miles by car) from the State of Hawaii's #1 marine life sanctuary where pods of dolphins come almost daily to rest, feed, and nurse their calves. The 19.5 North parallel is one of the Earth's 10 major vortices. This place, which the ancients knew  as &quot;The Pathway to the God,&quot; serves as a star gate portal, through which light codes enter the energetic matrix of the Earth to allow prayers and/or intentions made here to be &quot;broadcast&quot; to the world and beyond. 

A 5-star bistro, convenience store, hot tubs, massage therapy, kayak rentals and the bus stop are all within an easy walk. Cafes, banks, 2 post offices, 2 grocery stores and the local Farmer's Market are within a 2-mile stretch. 

Guests, volunteers and residents are likewise invited to help themselves to the abundance of fresh, organic edibles that fall at our footsteps on the property. Depending on the season, we are blessed with an abundance of papayas, bananas, avocados, oranges, guavas, passion fruits, mountain apples and more.</description>

And to tend the seedling as the idea of permaculture flowers into a beautiful new world by openly sharing all knowledge and skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/finca-morpho/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/finca-morpho/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Finca Morpho is a small tight knit regenerative educational experimental permaculture community on 4.2 hectares, close to the OSA peninsula's point of Cabo Matapalo, 14km south of Puerto Jimenez, Costa Rica on the road to Matapalo, the only purple gate. We are morphing ourselves and others to be more sustainable, creative, free, happy, at peace, and open-minded to all ideas and ways of lives. Being surrounded by an indescribable primal energy from the rainforest and the ocean has inspired us to &quot;Be the change we wish to see in the world&quot; - Mahatma Gandhi. By using biodynamic regenerative agriculture we are creating a system that will continue to make top soil for years to come on it's own and able to sequester carbon. We have integrated a zero waste policy and we are using all forms of human disposal and waste to enrich the environment around us. Plant and animal care for us is treating all plants and animals the way most people treat their house pets, with lots of love, attention, activities, and healthy food. We are striving towards a sustainable and self-sufficient model for others to learn from and to show others visiting the area how they can add some of these practices into their lives with little to no work involved.</description>

It is forming a model of sustainability in practice with the involvement of competent individuals and organisations. This model will be transferable to other locations in Slovenia and abroad. The Park is growing from amazing potentials of the region in Istria along the border between Slovenia and Croatia. The park relies on the work of many creative people designing a model of sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sustainability-park-istra/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sustainability-park-istra/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Sustainability park Istra is a charity project in beautiful Istria coastal region, at the border between Slovenia and Croatia. Our goals are to revitalize abandoned, vacant countryside area and create a practical example of sustainable rural development.

Since May 2014 we have hosted hundreds of volunteers from 29 countries and created an inspiring space of cooperation, creativity and harmony among volunteers and the locals.

In 2015 we plan to finish the renovation of old rectory next to the church in Hrvoji, several hundred years old and made of beautiful local stone. This will be a community's and volunteers' home and our project's headquarters. Until now, we already did a complete re-roofing, new floors and ceilings, electric wiring, inner walls and much more inside and outside of the house. Just next to the house we tend a hectare of organic permaculture garden with vegetables, asparagus, strawberries and cherries. We regularly do voluntary actions to help local community. This typically includes picking olives, grapes, cleaning overgrown terraces etc.</description>

Box trucks and buses have plenty of square feet, and creative DIY can convert a vehicle into a happy home. When authority asks, you can call it an art space, a sculpture, or a flightless bird.

Let's get together and buy a place to park, so we can have a place to become our true selves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-vandwellings/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-vandwellings/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&quot;The Vandwellings&quot; is only a concept. I want to turn a box truck into a house. I want to gut a van, and turn it into a hangout pod. I want to split the cost of land with like-minded wingnuts. 

Do you want to own some space where you can build a vehicle-based home?  Do you want to live on a bus? Do you want to stop wasting money on rent and start having a garden? 

If any of this sounds interesting, then we should talk or type to each other. I want to find a few other people with similar ideas to start talking and formulate a plan.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22633&quot;&gt;Kingston House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Remember “The Waltons” TV show? Ever wish you had been part of the Waltons' family? The vision of Kingston House is to be the Waltons' family times three: 20 residents living together as a supportive family of born-again Christians eating together, playing together, studying the Bible together, praying together, laughing together, learning together, and creating a rich and meaningful life together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/nozark-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/nozark-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Can you imagine how awesome it would be to live in a huge house full of your closest friends? Imagine the camaraderie of eating every meal with these friends, the abundance of joyful experiences hanging out with these friends any time you want, the treasure trove of memories your children will create growing up together with their friends, the benefits of raising your children together with your friends, confident that this support network of caring friends is always there to help you watch your children so that you can get your “me” time, and help your children with their homework, and help you work through life’s difficult challenges. Imagine how comforting it would feel knowing that there will always be someone there to greet you when you came home. Imagine the peace and security drifting off to sleep each night assured that there are trusted protectors in the house who will still be there when you wake up each morning. Now imagine being able to live this dream at less cost than you are probably spending now and doing less housework than you are probably doing now, giving you more time, more money, and more energy to enjoy your children and your life. This is the vision I have for Kingston House.

The house is a beautiful, 7000-sqare-foot, fully furnished estate nestled in the majestic Ozark Mountains, with a breath-taking view of the surrounding countryside. It's only a 500-foot walk to the largest lake in Madison County, perfect for swimming and fishing. It’s also a short drive from some of the best hiking, boating, rafting, fishing, caving, nature watching, and other awesome outdoor experiences that the Natural State has to offer, and only an hour and a half from Branson, the Christian entertainment capital of the world.

Kingston House is also conveniently situated in the middle of a well-established Christian neighborhood community, called Living Springs - 21 caring and supportive Christian households, most of whom meet together every Sunday in the neighborhood community building (only 600 feet from the house) for worship, fellowship, and dinner. Can you imagine how cool it would be to live in a house where, not only is each member of the household a born-again Christian, but everyone of your neighbors is also a born-again Christian? At Kingston House, this slice of Heaven is not just a dream, it's an every-day reality.

The goal of Kingston House is not to indoctrinate anyone into any particular lifestyle or belief system, but rather to provide for you a fun, supportive, caring, enjoyable, affordable, and amazingly cool place to live and grow in your own walk with God, and where you are encouraged to develop and exercise your own individual God-given gifts.

If this vision resonates with you, or if you are just curious, I invite you to bring your family to Kingston House for a relaxing and fun-filled visit. I will do my best to make you feel at home, because it is my hope that you will want to call Kingston House your next home.

The project will be resident-owned.  Visitors will have the opportunity to learn about ecovillage life and experience the urban forest we steward while living among us in dormitory style accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kenwood-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kenwood-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Kenwood Ecovillage will be a mix of shared/private living/working space for cottage industries, freelancers and entrepreneurs.  The project will be resident-owned.  Visitors will have the opportunity to learn about ecovillage life and experience the urban forest we steward while living among us in dormitory style accommodations.

Living in community will enable us to share our resources and spaces, which is easier on the planet as well as on our wallets.  We will support each other in starting independent businesses and co-ops, so that we can take charge of our own livelihoods and ensure that our work is safe, socially and ecologically responsible, and spiritually as well as materially rewarding.

We invite families, elders, students, spiritual seekers and teachers, people of all ethnic, racial and cultural backgrounds, strong women, sensitive men and gender benders of all types... all “dreamers, wishers and magic bean buyers...” who are ready to pioneer a better way to live.

The Kenwood property consists of a vacant convent, chapel and school buildings on 73 mostly forested acres adjacent to the Mt. Hope neighborhood in Albany New York.

The site features 225,000 built square feet including dormitory-style living spaces, classrooms and meeting rooms, areas that can be converted to apartment living, a gymnasium, a single-family house, workshop spaces, and a chapel. The grounds include lush forests, hiking trails, playing fields and tennis courts.

The availability of this property within the city of Albany presents an ideal opportunity to live in community, learning and teaching skills for living consciously and respectfully within society and the natural world.

Some of the possible activities at Kenwood include:

    Classes and workshops
    A youth hostel
    Venue for local performances and markets
    Cottage industry incubator
    Maker/hacker space
    Monastic and neo-monastic community living
    Natural and Organic horticulture
    Child care
    Elder care
    Summer camps
    Spiritual retreats
    Catering company and special events venue
    Set for historic films and movies

What would you do at the Kenwood?

We are now assembling a team of visionaries who are committed to crafting a viable plan for the Kenwood.  We are seeking a diverse membership and strive to welcome and accept all ages, races, ethnicities, religions, abilities, income levels, skills, interests, backgrounds, genders, sexual preferences, and family types.

Our goal is to create a flexible governance structure that facilitates living within our ecological means and empowers diverse residents to work together to create a culture that truly values differences and strives to avoid privileging any groups or individuals over others.</description>

      <name>Bundagen Co-operative Ltd</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22636&quot;&gt;Bundagen Co-operative Ltd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Bundagen community is a rural land sharing co-operative and wildlife sanctuary. We see our community as having essentially a caretaker role for this piece of coastal land and aim to create only low impact development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bundagen-co-operative-ltd/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bundagen-co-operative-ltd/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Bundagen is an intentional community established in August 1981 with three guiding principles:
social harmony;
environmental responsibility;
and economic independence.

We are a rural land sharing co-operative and wildlife sanctuary. We see our community as having essentially a caretaker role for this piece of coastal land and aim to create only low impact development. Regeneration of native vegetation in environmentally fragile areas is a focus, as is an emphasis on organic gardening.

THE LAND
Bundagen Co-operative owns and manages a total of 313 hectares of private property on the mid-north coast of NSW, just south of Coffs Harbour.

Bongil Bongil National Park forms all our boundaries including a headland and ocean beach. Bundagaree Creek runs through part of the land and we have two freshwater lakes.

A percentage of our land has high environmental value, approx 50% of which is protected and managed under a formal Conservation Agreement. Our land sits within the Gumbaynggirr nation.

THE PEOPLE
There are approximately 180 members, of whom about 110, with their children, are living in the twelve village areas. Bundagen is independent of mains water, sewerage and electricity. We rely on dams and rain-water tanks and use alternative technology, such as solar power and composting toilets. All residents pay a weekly levy which finances the community’s needs including shared equipment such as a tractor and fire tanker. As well, we have a library, food co-op, meditation space and community house where a café is held each week. Villages each have their own areas of interest; some share a common bathroom, gardens, mowers, trailers or water pumps. Apart from meetings and regular working bees, café and the beach, members come together to play volleyball or soccer, for yoga, chi gong or to sing, play music, or to meditate. We have an active weeding group and land care projects underway. There is also a playschool in the renovated dairy bails where our youngest residents get together each week. Older members now meet to plan for ‘The Last Resort’.

DECISION MAKING
All decisions are made on the land. We aim at reaching consensus but have our own form of modified consensus. We have monthly community meetings, which deal with everyday matters, and four general meetings a year to address major concerns. Bundagen newsletters keep members informed of our evolving agreements, topics of debate and all hatches, matches and dispatches. A group of fifteen annually elected co-ordinators, meet monthly and take responsibility for specific areas of administration such as secretarial, treasury, legal liaison, environment, membership, building, fire, water, roads etc.

MEMBERSHIP
Each member, whether resident or non-resident, has an equal parcel of shares in the Co-operative. Membership gives the individual access to the land and a voice in decision- making. The right to build and reside on the land is decided by community agreement. Our legal structure, as a rural co-operative, means that the community owns all improvements on the land rather than individuals holding freehold title.
MEMBERSHIP IN BUNDAGEN IS CLOSED

HISTORY
In the early 1980s, a development company planned to buy two farms and bushland at Bundagaree Head for a tourist development and golf course. Local environmentalists, concerned about the loss of valuable forest, secured the first options to buy and called for support. Bundagen was initially formed as a company and it asked for individual loans of $3000 from those hoping to prevent the development. Meetings were held on the headland and in Sydney as the dream of saving the land spread quickly through alternative networks. When the purchase price was realised we bought the land and soon after added a neighbouring property. The legal structure of the company was then changed and Bundagen Co-operative was formed. Those who had made the loans became the first shareholders. Some came to live on the land while others remained as non-residents, many living in Sydney.

In the 1980s, there was some turnover in membership however the community consolidated as village areas were settled and the sanctuary areas protected. An adjoining parcel of land was eventually also purchased. Here, sand extraction had left two freshwater lakes fringed by littoral rainforest. In the 1990s we campaigned for the neighbouring state forest to become national park rather than developed for housing and we celebrated when Bongil Bongil National Park was declared. Bundagen also seeded the establishment of two new intentional communities on the mid-north coast of NSW. In 2010 we finally secured much of the community’s forest under a formal conservation agreement.

After thirty years we know and love the land well. Our villages provide stable and continuing homes and our orchards and gardens provide us with fresh organic food. Some who came in the first years with small children, now have grandchildren growing up here. We have a burial area and take pride in managing the end of life rituals as well as the births.

Living on community can also be hard work. It is not just maintaining our own water and power and communication systems, or the battle with weeds, it is the work of getting along together which can be both exhausting and rewarding. Our decision-making and conflict resolution processes often seem cumbersome and we tweak at the edges as they slowly evolve. Bundagen might be seen as a microcosm of the macrocosm, with all the dramas of the wider world played out on our small stage.</description>

It was founded in 1936 by members of the Young People's Socialist League, from whence its name and emblem derive.[1] The Society owns 125 acres of land which comprise 75 individual home sites as well as several communal buildings and access to Barger Pond. The colony, sometimes known as Camp Three Arrows, was imbued with socialist and communitarian values and offers a wide range of cultural, educational and leisure activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/three-arrows-co-operative-society-inc/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/three-arrows-co-operative-society-inc/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Founded in 1936 by members of the Jewish labor movement, Three Arrows has evolved into a diverse and welcoming multi-generational membership which encourages participation in the life and work of the community. The members and families in our 75 houses seek to create a sense of cooperation in a world that increasingly promotes isolation. This is primarily a seasonal community, with 20% or weekend occupancy.</description>

We have cohoused before and enjoyed many aspects of it. We have one home with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. We also have an RV that we plan to live in if we can find the right group of people to join us. We are very ecologically conscious. We have grey water and are working on getting our greenhouse finished. We have chickens for eggs and goats for milk. Ideally we would like someone or several people who can help us with the garden, the fruit trees and some light construction. The rent for the large house is 1000.00 plus 300.00 in labor per month. Or any other arrangement similar to that.</description>

The general idea is to create an off grid village with these structures and a social community set in a modern Bohemian culture. Artists, musicians, writers, free thinkers, performers and other eccentrics like myself.
Essentially, creative people- starving artists on a low budget who are willing to pool resources to meet needs, and live more simply in order to really focus on your projects, passions and creativity, instead of slaving away for some company in order to pay high rent and utilities, and still have little time or money left to pursue what you’d rather be doing! (This is what a lot of us are doing right now!!)
Is this place right for you:
Are you a creative soul?
Don’t mind being in a remote, off grid, woodland location?
Would like to surround yourself with other likeminded people?
Would like to build your own yurt or wall tent for a home?
Willing to help others with gardening, landscaping, micro farming?
Can provide for your own personal expenses- water/power/food and about $30 a month for your share in land costs (taxes and upkeep).
Moving toward a self sustaining community
With the focus of the community being farm and arts, it makes sense to pursue the idea of a farm and arts market on site to possibly create an income from personal gardening efforts and creative endeavors. The opportunities are there, just looking for community members- one person, and one step at a time.

I am interested in higher evolutionary practices but no 420 or drinkers except upon occasion.
I'm currently in Virginia; think North Carolina, Tennessee or maybe Delaware are good places to buy/rent land/housing at reasonable cost.
I am open to location and my clan.
I have dreams of a compound type place where various businesses can occur and the education of an evolutionary level is offered.  An organic/natural garden and maybe at-risk youth or young people to run that and the amazing whole foods market where to go food in the community store is available for the community at large. Many ideas, but clan must come first.</description>

We strive to create a culture of compassionate communication and open mindedness. Our community encourages personal responsibility and emotional maturity. We strive to give back to the earth what we take and to be an example of balance to the world, as we endeavor to achieve balance, ourselves. Our land will be inhabited including the principles of co-housing, to encourage cohesion. Members will build their own homes using alternative building methods, passive house standards, and/or reclaimed and sustainably harvested materials. We will, also, utilize a system of time banking to encourage giving and receiving between members.
 We are so blessed to live in the the oldest mountain region in the world. Imagine the wisdom we can glean from communing with our world's matriarch! We have the fortune, as well, to live close to an veteran intentional community, a vineyard, 30 min from a city and 30 minutes from an artist community. It doesn't get too much better than this!</description>

Our center of operations is in Asheville, NC, where the organization coordinates all related activities.
There are also several Model Community Property locations in and around Asheville.  
Outreach is conducted from the Center of Operations, where associates engage with outside parties who are interested in observing or participating in an MCP lifestyle arrangement.
Our lifestyle arrangements are reflective of our mission, with each being reflective of:
1 - Equitable exchanges, wherein investors agree to a fixed, reasonable rate of return on their investment (4-5% annual);
2 - Shared use of resources;
3 - Self-governed decision-making, wherein all associates participate in decision-making while agreeing to be self-responsible.
Ours is a unique community perspective that match investors with residents who prefer to live in community without longterm commitment.  We offer a structure within which the responsibilities and rewards of property ownership can be shared by those participating in its lifestyle arrangements. 
MCP does not own property nor does it employ those who participate in its arrangements.  Our role in community relationships is to broaden and strengthen them by offering communication tools, a self-governed structure, and the management of necessary financial transactions.  Our associates make the rest happen.
Those interested in association with the organization are described as:
*Active, willing participants
*Compassionate
*Concerned
*Contributive
*Engaged

      <name>Festina Lente</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22648&quot;&gt;Festina Lente&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To farm organically, producing and processing food (mainly fruits &amp; vegetables, some garden herbs), establish a small farm business, and generally collaborate/support each other to lead a healthy, vibrant and fulfilling life – engaging positively with the local community to build relations and expand healthy living and eating practices. 

Spiritual practice is welcomed, but not required. All religious traditions are respected. Tibetan Buddhism is practiced by the community founder. There is a small capilla or chapel on the property which can be used for meditation or prayer by community members. 

Participation in Festina Lente requires a mature, grounded commitment – in body, mind and spirit. A certain level of respect, as well as fiscal and social responsibility is required. If you break or destroy something, you’ll be responsible to fix or replace it – be that a tool, tree or relation. Effective communication, right relations and conflict transformation are important processes we will practice together.  In addition to working together on the farm, sharing occasional meals, fireside chats, star gazing and outings to local attractions is anticipated. Nearby community neighbors regularly organize sweat lodges and diverse gatherings that include a Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) celebration, potlucks and seasonal rituals (solstice, spring ditch cleaning, luminarias). 

The community founder has lived and travelled abroad extensively working in international development focused on capacity building and education. A foodie, friendly, detail-oriented, hard-working grandchild of immigrants, seeking open-minded, happy, skilled collaborators. 

COMMUNITY GOALS &amp; ACTIVITIES:

Below is my vision as the founder. I’m open to other’s creative inclinations and passions… co-creating and collaborative ventures outside this scope, especially if your interests are ecologically and spiritually holistic.

1) Restore and then maintain an outdoor kitchen garden and commercial size greenhouse using heirloom seeds (there is an active local seed exchange) that will fully feed the household members, selling the surplus in the local farmer’s markets.

2) Run a productive, organic fruit orchard and make value added products from the harvest including jams, chutney, dried fruit and salsas. Transition the orchard to an integrated, holistic farming model that will draw beneficial insects, promote soil fertility and yield sufficient produce for wildlife and humans.

3) Restore the riparian habitat of the Rio Grande, replanting Cottonwoods and native plants especially beneficial to pollinators, reduce invasive plants like Siberian Elm, Russian Olive trees, etc. Continue clearing sections of the river front for our use including: fire-pit, meditation area, picnic area.

4) Finish barn to enable multi-functional use as: drying area, cooking classes, summer housing for volunteers and visitors. 

5) Start a farm-to-table cooking school, demonstrating how to grow organic kitchen gardens and make delicious, nutritious, internationally inspired dishes…Thai, Middle Eastern, African, Asian, Afghan, Spanish, Italian yumminess.

6) Collaborate with WOOFF volunteers to expand the farm and explore offering on-site camping and guided eco and cultural tours and hikes in the local area.

7) Expand to another greenhouse to commercially grow organic heirloom chilies and other produce (kale, collards, mustard greens, and tomatoes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/festina-lenta/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/festina-lenta/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Creating an abundant environment to feed - in body, mind and spirit- and house humans, as well as native species, beneficial plants and insects is the primary aim of this community-farm. Festina Lente is focused on environmentally sound land management, holistic, organic farming within a small, shared, and supportive community – of two-leggeds, four-leggeds, winged ones and all the other wild things that wander and frolic here. Community may be a bit of a misnomer as the farm is currently set up and permitted for only 2 dwellings – a main house and guest house (which needs to be finished). That means 2-3 people would live here permanently. In the future, WOOFers (farm volunteers/apprentices) and other guests will be able to camp and be housed in the large barn by the river. This would eventually bring the community to about 6-10 people in the summers. 

This community is based on farm collaboration, productive communication and camaraderie. We will be living in close proximity and working together to produce and sell what we grow and create – both in terms of farm products, as well as (potentially) other endeavors like herb baskets, incense sticks, art-craft, eco-tours, farm-to-table cooking classes. There is ample opportunity for creative and artistic creation, as well as a farm business / cottage industry – drying herbs, making jams, and other products to sell at the local farmer’s markets, co-ops and local art fairs. The land also provides ample wood for firewood, camp fires and other projects….like fencing, bird houses, etc. However, the reality is living solely off of these efforts is not possible and more traditional paid employment will be necessary for members to supplement whatever income the farm may provide, unless they won the lottery or have a generous trust fund. 

Presently, there is room for one person or a couple to live here, ideally in a mobile home (not provided) until the guest house is finished.  If you are a skilled carpenter or builder, there may be an opportunity to help finish the guest house and live there for reduced rent. The bathroom &amp; kitchen installation and flooring is the main work needed – electrical, septic and gas hook-up has been completed. The guest house is a beautiful space of approximately 800 sq ft, well insulated and lit with its own patio and will come comfortably and tastefully furnished. 

STATUS AND APPROACH

In the immediate term, things are starting off with small, humble steps, proceeding slowly forward. The herb garden has been established and pollinator-friendly plants and zones are being expanded. The greenhouse needs significant repairs to be operational and the large barn is functional, but needs cosmetic finishings (dry wall, lighting and windows expanded). The guest house also needs work to allow a community partner to move in (principally bathroom, kitchen, flooring – electrical, septic and gas hookups have been completed).  
I’ve found embracing this perpetual work in progress and not being overwhelmed by the unexpected hiccups and serendipities which constantly arise is a key element of enjoying and thriving here. Bear poked thru the screen last night, skunks dug up all the new plants last night, eagles are hunting along the river, Farm Bureau has a new program for replanting old fruit trees, neighbor’s dog took garden shoes yesterday, go for a swim in the river between pruning and weeding, farm buddies have extra tomatoes for you today, time for acequia communal ditch cleaning in the spring….

WHO THIS COMMUNITY IS A FIT FOR

If you’d like to farm, but cannot purchase your own land, or simply want to explore NM and organic farming for a time – this could be a good opportunity for you. Members need to be: 

(1) financially self-sustaining (able to pay for rent and expenses) 

(2) physically strong and capable of carrying out heavy labor, intense farm work - trimming trees, repairing fences, clearing brush, gardening, repairing and maintaining farm equipment, etc. usually for 8-14 hrs a day 5-6 days a week

(3) have their own transportation
 
(4) be willing to commit for a period of at least 6 months to a year

(5) be interested/skilled in organic, holistic farming or gardening – with a keen willingness to learn and collaborate together to discover what works and is financially viable as a business. Skills in carpentry or the other trades and business are a big plus.  

Mature, responsible, and happy, grounded applications are welcome. 

EXPECTATIONS: 

-FINANCES: Members will have their own financial resources and means to sustain themselves economically, apart from farm activities and any potential income which may be earned. Barter and trade are commonly used in this area, which helps reduce financial costs. However, having a formal, paying local job is a necessity for community members as farm income is not yet established or stable. 

-FARM &amp; BUSINESS ACTIVITIES: Currently, farm produce is mainly being used for our own consumption. The intent is to expand activities and productivity into a small business. Farm activities, facilities, responsibilities, investments and any resulting income will be shared in an equitable and reasonable fashion according to the investments of the members.

-OWNERSHIP: Property ownership will remain with the founder.  It is possible to purchase your own land on an adjoining lot from a neighbor and continue to farm collaboratively using the Festina Lente facilities (barn, greenhouse, fields, orchard).  

-HOUSING: Community members can rent housing on the property (once the guest house is finished) or arrange for their own accommodations locally. The guest house is suitable for an individual or couple. Current facilities are insufficient for families. 

-PETS &amp; FARM ANIMALS: Pets and farm animals are able to be accommodated on the farm, with prior discussion and agreement on how and where they will be housed.

-DAMAGES: Strict responsibility for damages to property, including equipment, facilities and any other assets will be maintained. Following established practices to maintain the security of the property and effective care and maintenance of equipment is required. 

-EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST: If you’re interested and would like a response – please take some time to read and reflect on this. Re-read carefully what has been offered. Determine if this is truly a fit for you. Then write me a thoughtful, detailed response. Tell me about yourself – what your dreams and visions of community are, something about your skills and abilities, your finances, who you are, where you’ve lived, what your strengths and weaknesses are, how you’d like to grow and what a good life and legacy means for you. Short, two line blurbs and improvised, sparse texts will not be answered. Invest in this and I will reciprocate. 

-ACCEPTANCE TO COMMUNITY: After an initial expression of interest is received, we can engage in further dialogue and exploration to see if we are a good match to collaborate initially through email. Then we can chat over the phone and skype. Once you become serious about potentially joining this community, it would be a good idea for you to plan to visit and explore the local area and farm. Especially if you are coming from outside New Mexico this is very important as not just the farm but the local culture and environment should be a match for you. There are inexpensive local housing options like couch surfing, WOOFing and camping. For final acceptance into the community, five references should be provided (3 business/work, 2 personal) and security deposit of $1,500 will be paid.  

-NOT A GOOD FIT FOR: those wishing to live money-free lifestyles, including off-grid, scavenging, and similar approaches. Unfortunately, the current housing is insufficient for children – there’s only room for a single person or couple that doesn’t mind living in close quarters (guest house/studio). 
 
FARM PROFILE 

Located along the banks of the Rio Grande, this land has been farmed for over 5,000 years. Originally cultivated by the Anasazi, it is shared with many and requires harmonious living with an abundant and rambunctious wildlife community, including black bear, coyote, bald eagle, red tailed hawk, pheasant, owl, fox, skunk, raccoon, gopher, mice, elk, deer … et al. Finding a way to allow these neighbors to reside and prosper here, while not succumbing to poison, traps and other violence is at times a real challenge, but an important intent. Finding also a way to live in community with the diverse people who reside here, and all too frequently fear and distrust one another, that include: Puebloans or Native Americans, Hispanic descendants of the Spanish colonizers, recent Mexican immigrants, Anglos (predominantly artists), the largest Sikh community in the US and an ever-expanding mix of other flavorful groups… is something you should be aware of and interested in if you want to come here. 
Festina Lente Farm is on five acres of irrigated land on the banks of the Rio Grande. It is part of the local acequia, a system of communal water ownership brought by the Spanish in medieval times, based on flood irrigation drawing water from the Rio Grande. There is a fruit orchard of over 100 trees – apples, pears, peaches, apricots, cherries and grapes, as well as an herb garden and commercially sized greenhouse (in need of repair to be functional). It has a bosque, or a riparian wooded area, of traditional cottonwood and wild flowers along the river which borders the property. The three fields are sometimes used for boarding horses, but could be used to farm cover crops or food for migrating birds. The area surrounding the house and barn is in the process of being landscaped as a pollinator garden and bird sanctuary. There is spectacular bird watching including: Bald Eagles that hunt along the river, cranes, ducks, geese, wood peckers, hummingbirds, towhees, juncos, orioles, kingbirds, magpies, doves, warblers, grosbeaks, nuthatches, chickadees, red-winged blackbirds, robins. 

LOCAL AREA

Velarde, where Festina Lente Farm is located, is a small farming valley coming out the mountains and Rio Grande gorge to the north, near the Colorado border. It has a micro-climate particularly suited to farming and a large share of the farms selling at the farmer’s markets, Whole Foods and other outlets are based here.  Historically, the Three Sisters (maize, squash, beans) were cultivated. In modern times, crops have shifted from grapes to apples to chiles.
Mesa Prieta, the largest documented petroglyph site in the US with 150,000 glyphs spanning 5,000 years of Native and colonial history is just behind the house. Petroglyphs can be seen along the road as you approach the farm. There is a wonderful, active non-profit dedicated to documenting the petroglyphs and leading public tours which most of the neighborhood participates in.

The closest large town is Espanola, about 10 min drive south on highway 68. It is 45 min from Santa Fe, 35 to Los Alamos (which are south). To the north it’s 30 min to Taos, 20 min to Dixon, a very active mixed community with an excellent co-op, community center and library. Other local attractions: Ojo Caliente hot springs and Abiquiu are about 40-45 min away.

ATTRACTIONS &amp; ACTIVITIES

You can swim and fish right from the house. Cycling on lovely back country roads, including the one the house is on is a common hobby. Strategically situated between Taos and Santa Fe, it offers easy access to hiking, skiing, lakes, hot springs and scenic drives in Georgia O’Keefe country, as well as many historic monuments and art galleries.

CLIMATE 

We have four pronounced seasons here with a colorful fall filled with golden cottonwoods and aspens, cold winters with occasional snows (1-2 inches that immediately melts), standard spring weather and hot, dry summers with monsoon rains that usually begin in July. The weather of Northern New Mexico is much drier than other parts of the country but much more temperate than the southern part of the state. Being part of the southwest, we have a huge temperature differential between daytime and nighttime temps – usually a 40 degree differential. For example, in the summer daytime temps average 85-90 degrees and god down to the 40-50s in the evenings. Global climate change has significantly altered weather patterns and we are getting earlier frosts which has significantly reduced orchard productivity. Rising temperatures, on the other hand, have created excellent opportunities for chile cultivation, which is a good cash crop. 

The farm is situated in a ‘banana belt’ micro-climate that is warm and well suited to farming.  Because it’s situated along the Rio Grande, the air is cool and not as dry as other areas. Mosquitos are quite prevalent throughout the summer but tend to be active mostly during dawn and dust. 

COMMUNITY INTENT

I purchased this farm as a refuge and sanctuary from my often difficult and draining career in international development. Cicero said, “If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need.” I would humbly add, a community of friends to that. I’m interested in gathering a few like-minded souls to share this lovely place and farm together as, like so much in life, it requires a group effort to succeed. Along the lines of the Ancient Greek philosopher, Epicurus, whose “philosophy of the garden” asserted happiness was the result of friendship, freedom and an analyzed life – I believe happiness and fulfillment come from hard physical work rooted in a natural environment, living in the three C’s (collaboration, cooperation, community) and a discerned, spiritually grounded living….with a little rambunctious playfulness and belly-aching laughter. 

COMMUNITY SIZE

There’s room for a single person or couple to live here - either in the guest house (which needs completion) or in a temporary housing structure such as a mobile home or yurt. With a little sweat and dedication we can grow enough food to live off of and trade or sell at the farmer’s markets. Lots of odd jobs can be done locally for a little extra financing. I also plan to continue doing short term consultancies in aid work to sustain myself. New Mexicans have a long history of clever resiliency to survive which is absolutely charming…or as they say here part of the land’s enchantment. There is no single path to success here. We’re weaving a tapestry together on the land and with each other. 

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST

A lot of information has been provided here. If you’re interested in learning more and would like a response – please take some time to read and reflect on what has been provided. It is HGIGHLY recommended you re-read and carefully consider the expectations, vision and other requisites for collaboration. Determine if this is truly a fit for you. Then write me a thoughtful, detailed response. Tell me about yourself – what your dreams and visions of community are, what experience you have with community and collaborative ventures, something about your skills and abilities, your finances, who you are, where you’ve lived, what your strengths and weaknesses are, how you’d like to grow and what a good life and legacy means for you. Short, two line blurbs and improvised, sparse messages will not be answered. Invest in this and I will reciprocate. 

Thank you for taking the time to read and explore this budding community. 

Blessings and best wishes that you find your ideal community and lead a full, happy life.

That is why we’re founding this community, because in capitalism we just don’t fit in, we hate it here, we can’t stand that horrible society and we want such a different life. We want to go live on the land, put our hands to work, love, learn, do all the important things. We want to determine our own lives, together and not be determined. We want to share property, money, work, … for the benefit of everyone involved. We believe that the way we want to live is only possible in an intentional community on the countryside, neither in the city, nor alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/gemeinschaft-tortuga/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/gemeinschaft-tortuga/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We’re founding an intentional community located in northern Spain. At the moment we still live in Leipzig, Germany. Our main principles are:


* anticapitalism
* anti-esoteric / anti-spiritual / anti-religious
* antisexism
* communal economy
* consensus
* ecology
* freedom of domination / non-hierarchical structures / anarchy
* freedom in love (love who and how ever you want to)
* self-determined education
* self-sufficiency
* transparency</description>

A working circle of friends thriving through the care of the land that provides for family and community.

Mission Statement

To create a neighbourhood scale community where people live, work and have fun together.  To live a low impact life that meets our needs, with as little harm to the earth as possible. To deepen our connections, learn, grow and inspire others. To create and maintain a refuge for our community now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/goldenrod-land-co-op/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/goldenrod-land-co-op/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are 3 families who have been meeting regularly to create a land co-op with the intention of buying land (70-160 acres, within 2 hours of Regina to the East/North-East). We have recently completed the legal documents involved in becoming a non-profit co-operative, learning to use consensus, looking at land, exploring financing options, developing business plans and getting to know each other better.
We envision for the future: buying land, building a community center/temporary housing, then spending some time developing the property, building homes and transitioning to living out of the city (part or full time).
We are looking for 2-9 more families or individuals to join us in this.  The project of working on the membership structure of our Co-op and the application process is ongoing. As prospective Co-op members emerge we hope to continue to refine the contents of these documents. Rather than present our ideas as fait accompli, we encourage new members to join in making our Co-op a living entity that changes and grows as we do.</description>

Community/spiritual practices include at least three shared meals a week, morning prayer (optional), sometimes evening singing, and on weekends we usually take part in a house church that's connected with our community. We have a backyard garden, two cats, a dog, and eight chickens. We are drug-free, and there is no smoking inside the house. 

We are interested in one or two additional members--each would have their own bedroom and potentially their own bathroom as well. Some furnishings are available. Exact rent amount and availability dates are dependent on timing and total number of members.

primitive living skills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/life-practice-natural-farming-and-living-directly-closely-with-the-earth/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/life-practice-natural-farming-and-living-directly-closely-with-the-earth/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are two people who have been on a journey into a truly healthy lifestyle for many years, but just recently made the leap of purchasing 20 acres an hour north of portland. We believe that by living close to nature, gardening or gathering all of our own foods, growing a spiritual practice and living with like-minded folk, we can be the best possible versions of ourselves.  

Right now we are…..
-Designing and building a 150 square foot burmed in hobbit house out of natural materials on the land and excited about having people come out, help and learn!
-Planting tons of fruit and nut trees 
-Growing about an acre of food spread out on different areas throughout the property. 
-Planting every seed by hand with love, but do have a tractor on site for cutting trails and the really hard projects. 
-Using a mix of Masanobu Fukuoka's Natural Farming, permaculture and our own intuition to design, grow and build. 
-Living in a camper with a wood stove and propane burner while building our hobbit house
-Using a solar panel to power minimal electronics but are moving in the direction of living without any electricity. 
-Living without refrigeration, so our food only stays as cool as the ground temperature. 
-Spending much of our time in the forest, gathering berries and wild foods, listening to the plants and bathing and lounging in the creek. 
-Drying herbs and making medicines. 
-Buying less and making more with our own hands. 
-Dumpster diving at organic groceries to supplement what we cant grow and save food from the landfill. 
-Growing a more direct connection with the land upon which we live. 

We believe that this space has many things to share with us, so we are practicing listening instead of imposing our will. Our intention is to learn how to live more and more direct with the earth every day, and lessen our use of all things industry-made. 

We have decided on the pacific north-west for now and are looking to connect with anyone else in the area or any travelers passing through who have similar intentions for their life practice. Even if you don’t have intentions of living here, we enjoy guests and conversations with like-minded souls, and have a tipi set up just for visitors to camp in and enjoy the simple life. We enjoy sitting around the fire and cooking dinner in the tipi with visitors. We are hoping to attract those who are either familiar with or very interested in: hunting and harvesting wild edibles, building a tiny natural home on the land (cob, straw bale, yurt, tipi etc),hiking in and hauling materials by hand instead of driveways and drive-up service, living without electricity, primitive skill development, listening to his/her intuition, thriving  completely off the land, practicing group meditation/breathwork/dancing, being truly honest with himself/herself and others, able to express how he/she is feeling, attempting to live in a compassionate state of non-judgement, working very hard when feeling called but also able to completely relax and take time to himself/herself. These of course are our ideals and we are still practicing them daily, please come and practice with us.  There are many things to figure out and your input is welcome and needed.</description>

It is a place of hope and healing as well as a springboard from which guests can seek training, new skills, and work that will provide for their needs. Women live in community, share life and meals with one another, and are encouraged in their personal spiritual journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/lydias-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/lydias-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Lydia’s House is rooted in the Christian tradition, specifically in the practices of the Catholic Worker movement. While the mission of Lydia’s House is to provide housing and support for women and their children in times of crisis, it is not a housing agency. Rather, the House is a home grounded in the Catholic Worker commitments to personalism, solidarity, faith and community, practiced alongside gospel-prescribed works of mercy.

Unlike some Catholic Worker Houses, Lydia’s House is not a church or host a congregation. However, we hope that this House is holy ground:

A sanctuary for all who come through our doors
A space for meaningful dialogue about the structures and systems that keep the poor poor
A place for prayer and transformation for all, regardless of income, class or culture</description>

      <name>The Lavra</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22662&quot;&gt;The Lavra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Three principles shape the other areas of our existence for which we hope to be an example:

1. SERVICE
Central to nearly all refined philosophies and reflective religions is the call to serve others.  It means considering the skills and natural abilities you have been given and harnessing them to their highest and best use for the good of others.  Serving others is not only a privilege or an option for those who can but an obligation that we all should feel.  It is in serving others that we discover our humanity. 

The service imperative impels us to work tirelessly to, in the words of Karen Armstrong, “alleviate the suffering of our fellow creatures, to dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and put another there, and to honor the inviolable sanctity of every single human being.”  This is a call to compassion that should translate into concrete action.

The scope of service is critical to our vision.  Many people serve their immediate family tirelessly; they sacrifice themselves for their children, occasionally their parents or friends.  While such service is laudable compared to a life lived solely for oneself, our vision for service goes beyond one’s closest circles.  One’s duty to the world does not end with the closest circles of family and friends but begins there.  Serving merely those with whom one has familial or friendship ties does not satisfy the call to sacrificially love others that is critical to most world religions and philosophies.  As a result, the paramount value is found in service to the local, national, and global community.  In fact, one of the most enduring ways to care for those closest to someone is to work tirelessly toward creating a better world for them to inhabit.  Thus, we aim to serve first those in our local community, then our nation, and finally the world as a whole.  We envision a day when the whole planet begins to transform as more and more people expand their circles of responsibility. 

The current social momentum in American society works against service to others on multiple fronts.  At its most callous, the message is often simply that we bear no responsibility to others: everyone is responsible for his/her own success or failure.  In fact, the world rewards those who seek after what they want regardless of its effects on others.  Still other social messages tell us that we have a responsibility to others but only after taking care of our own needs; we cannot give to others until we have learned to discover and indeed love ourselves.  True service to others comes as a result of a secure and overflowing self.  Too often, however, the preparation to service in this vision trumps actual service.  We hold that we should be uncomfortable in our service; authentic love and compassion for others means putting their needs above one’s own.  Our needs can wait, no matter how pressing they may appear.  Our community aims to remind each other relentlessly of this total obligation to serve.  Service is the first of all of our goals and trumps the two below.  If we must choose, we choose to serve first.

Every member of the Lavra takes a commitment to him/herself and each other to work positively for others.  Normally, this commitment will be reflected in one’s occupation but it could also be an attitude that governs one’s life outside of work.  We will encourage, support, and monitor this commitment.  We will exemplify it in our interactions with each other and the friends of the Lavra who visit. 

2. GROWTH
Life is a dynamic process, not a static state.  We are given a set amount of time here to make of it what we can.  We can squander it or continually improve ourselves.  Living at the Lavra means being committed to continual growth in all human dimensions but especially intellectual, emotional, creative, and spiritual dimensions, so that we create a community of inquiry.  The growth imperative does not require a self or the development of an ego—rather it can be seen as growth into a recognition of what is real or into selflessness. The point is that we uphold a community of inquiry and exploration that is supportive to this process.

Diversity of opinion and perspective is critical for growth.  This diversity will be assured by encouraging people of diverse backgrounds, ages, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, intellectual/faith traditions, and other opportunities to provide fresh perspectives.  We plan to support such a lifestyle by holding regular lectures/discussions on religious/social/philosophical topics, and dedicating an area of the property to meditation and worship.

The process of growth addresses the mind, the senses, and our spiritual core.  As we grow as individuals and as a community, we will seek to avoid temptations that often arise with communities, especially hedonistic intellectualism and unreflective hedonism.  Hedonistic intellectualism arises when people gain pleasure from the arguments themselves and thus really are not on a real search grounded in compassion and service for others.  Such environments banter around ideas like a sport, congratulating each other on their erudition and acuity but without much amounting from it.  Intellectualism is critical to growth but it must be placed in the service of humanity.  Discussion has to be motivated by goals that matter for the world, not just oneself.  We all must live uncomfortably for others and if we have been given the gift of some clarity and discernment, this should be employed for others.  Likewise, while the search for sensual and spiritual pleasures are important aspects of growth, they must be reflectively pursued.  Unreflective hedonism is the source of much destruction and harm.  Hedonistic goals are not good in and of themselves but rather find their meaning within a broader intellectual worldview.  An environment conducive to growth thus avoids hedonistic intellectualism and unreflective hedonism.

3. CONSCIENTIOUS, REFLECTIVE, RESPONSIBLE, AND SUSTAINABLE LIVING
This principle is a continual process, rather than a set of rules.  It means reflecting about the choices we make and the impact they have on those around us and the planet.  We don’t place ourselves at the center of decision making processes but the community and the world.  We see this imperative as a sequential process.  We begin by pledging to be conscientious, by which we mean being intimately aware of our own motivations and actions, particularly how they are shaped by our personal histories, social conditions, and immediate surroundings.  When we are conscientious, we do not act by accident or strict impulse but with keen observation of oneself and the world.  Then, we promise to be reflective.  That is, we pledge to consider the impact of our decisions on ourselves, the community, and the world at large.  Finally, we will choose the responsible path that focuses on the good of the community/world rather than our own convenience or personal gain.  It is a process that emphasizes the means rather than the end. This principle is often enacted in our community through dedication to growing and eating local, organic foods (ideally from our own community garden), making our own goat cheese, eating our own eggs, and generally being as tied to the food process as possible. We make vegetarian food for our weekly communal meals, and encourage conscious eating and purchasing of food products. We have also recently moved to solar power for the entire community, and encourage responsible energy use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-lavra/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-lavra/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;In Palestine in the 5th century, there arose a unique form of interdependent living.  It was called The Lavra, an ancient Greek word for a spot where small paths came together in a sort of intersection of souls.  We are attempting to bring this model to the modern world...

Our Community Structure:

We recognize that there is no single recipe for building new ways of living together. Our model for developing a new mode of existence is not for everyone, but we hope to offer a valuable contribution to a network of alternative living environments that provide people options beyond the binary world of single family residences and solo apartments. 

Within the realm of alternative communities, we are trying to navigate the space between:

A commune and co-housing.
A commune typically shares strong ideological commitments, shared financial resources, and usually exists largely isolated and independent from the world around it.  Co-housing usually involves a closer integration to surrounding society, more limited financial pooling, more independent living environments, and less shared commitment to a common religious/spiritual worldview.  While we are supportive of both communes and cohousing, we want to create a middle path that retains much of the integration with surrounding society and independent living environments associated with co-housing, but emphasizes the shared ideology and common purpose of the commune. 
Historically, the full communal life is theoretically appealing but challenging in practice as most communities become increasingly individualistic over time.  We aim to become a mutually-supportive interdependent community that balances the need for personal solitude with the social opportunities and resource optimization that come from communal living. Private space is provided and respected in our community, but “community time” is also allotted and encouraged through activities like shared exercise, movie/lecture nights, common weekly meals, and community chores.

In our lives together, each person will dedicate him/herself to service through their vocation/occupation outside the Lavra; he or she will be integrated into the surrounding world and that world (especially friends/family) are always welcome into our community.  The idea is that we will not be cut off from the world around us but rather serve that world, provide an example of alternative living, and become a sanctuary when respite from that world is needed.

The goal is to create a living environment that balances the need for privacy and solitude within the larger goal of robust community.  The model is to have separate ‘hermitages’ for each unit of the lavra, which can mean a single person, a couple, or a family.  Since people differ in their natural constitution and the stage in their life, there are varying degrees of privacy and isolation.  Some hermitages are separate, stand-alone dwellings with a designated surrounding land that is private and for which the member(s) are solely responsible.  Others live in the main house which is the Lavra Center, though even they have their own entrance and private outside area.  The hermitages are zones of individuality within the larger communal setting.

The remainder of the property is considered common.  The kitchen and living area of the Lavra Center acts as a hub open to all residents and friends of the Lavra.  Eventually, ancillary buildings will be added to the common area, such as a meditation/worship cabin, a mutli-use room for yoga/movie night/public lectures, and a soaking area that will also be common use.  In our desire to be close to natural processes, we also have our version of a farm on our 5 acres of land, with a vegetable garden, vineyard, and an animal area with chickens and milking goats. 

Our interaction with each other is governed by the desires of the group.  The minimal interaction involves a shared communal meal carried on each Sunday night and a work afternoon where we all spend time on chores around the property.  We also have shared ritual life, celebrating the momentous occasions of our lives, the seasonal fluctuations, and the religious holidays that are important to each of us. 

The Lavra also serves as a hub for people who think differently and more humanely about religion in San Luis Obispo County.  Over time, we can develop regular movie nights, lecture series, and possible retreats.  We want to share the Lavra with the world.  We want to be an example to all of a new kind of living that places its value on serving others, spiritual growth, and conscientious living, rather than materialism and ego.  We want to share the value of alternative models of living and real experimentation in solving the pressing problems we face as a society. While we only began this process of development a few years ago and still have a long way to go, we have already developed a reflective, conscious community, and look forward to continuing to grow.</description>

We are inspired by the nature around us as we attempt to create human habitat that emulates the beauty and complexity of living systems.  We seek to intertwine reason and intuition, aesthetics and efficiency. We are interested in increasing our skills and education through experience, mentorship, sharing and study, and growing as individuals. Within a thriving cluster of neighboring income sharing communities, we are creating a viable, regenerative alternative to the mainstream. We intend to strengthen the relationships between existing communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/cambia/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/cambia/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are forming an egalitarian and income sharing community. We are co-creating a culture of social sustainability and harmony that nourishes us as well as the earth.  We focus on re-humanizing the scale of our lives. We do that with slower pace, balance in our lives, deep social connection, natural building, education, creativity, and intuitive structure to our time and space. 
While we are focused on interpersonal and cultural aspects of our community, we are interested in building small, beautiful, natural housing, doing our best to be ecologically conscious, using new and old technologies, and upholding values of minimalism. 
We want to continually learn about what works in community and do our best to integrate our lessons into our lifestyle.
We are planning educational programs in subjects including experiential natural building workshops, off grid technologies, crafts, and nature awareness. We are working on understanding what makes communities thrive through sociological research.</description>

This property is absolutely beautiful!  It is located inland 45 minutes from St. Augustine and Jacksonville, Florida.  I have a working orchard, vegetable and herb gardens.  The orchard consists of pomegranate, fig, peach, Japanese plum, pecan.  I have matured strawberry that is continually expanding in size.  All plantings are heirloom organic, non-GMO and cultivated using organic growing regulations.  I am not certified organic but could become so.  A note on my disability:  I am a Disabled Benzene worker.  Which means I have severe multiple chemical sensitivity and living/working with others who use fragrance in or on anything is impossible.  So I am looking for others who do not want to tolerate chemical fragrances.  I need someone who has an income; be it SSD or SS or other, to be a Co-Applicant for loan approval to purchase a new mobile home on my land.  This co-applicant will be co-owner as well.  I also have business opportunity visions in and out of the garden!  So please call me and we can talk about all the details and any questions you have.   Thank you!  (386)328-0398&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/tina-yoxtheimer-homeland-owner/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/tina-yoxtheimer-homeland-owner/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;2.52 BEAUTIFUL organic acres with 15 year old orchard, herb and vegetable garden.

- Participating in the Kingdom of God: through loving one another, inviting in the stranger, upholding the value &amp;amp; dignity of those around us, reducing our environmental impact, sharing our collective resources, planting gardens, creating music &amp;amp; working against systems which oppress people (and much more!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-house-of-commons/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-house-of-commons/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We enjoy meeting people from every walk of life and sharing in hot beverages, theological discussions, church (universal), house concerts in our livingroom, bike rides, creating art, gardening, raising chickens, self-expression, snowball fights, being nice. 

We are a collection of individuals who believe that each person is valuable and deserves to be treated with dignity, respect and care. We invite all into our home for meals, gardening, prayer, among other things, and over the years we have build quite the little family around us. 

We do our best to walk alongside our neighbours in solidarity, we uphold those around us who are faced with daily injustices, we plant gardens to participate in healing of creation, we invite anyone to our table to eat amongst us, we take in the sick and care for them, and we respond to the needs of one another and others as best as we can.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22671&quot;&gt;No Name Yet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To create a self-sustaining, Earth loving eco-community based on common values of harm-none and spiritual growth with personal responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/no-name-yet-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/no-name-yet-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hi!
I have recently had an enormous spiritual event in my life. After 5 years and a complete rebuild of my life, dismissing the old and creating the new, as guided by Goddess, I am ready to get serious.

I am planning an intentional community.

I own 20 acres in far northern California. The winters are mild and the summers are HOT!

I am looking for 12 to 15 awakened, energetic, Earth-loving, Spirit guided people with skills and love to offer the community.

My life has been one of leadership and manifestation and I am looking for awakened leaders to build an awesome, self-sustaining community. 

As a leader, I like to listen carefully to where people want to go, and then lead them there. I am more of a facilitator of happiness and personal/spiritual growth.

I am looking for people with vision. I am not particular about the details of how the community manifests, as long as the result is sustainable and Earth loving and Spirit centered. 

I am open to all spiritual paths as long as they are kind and loving and teach personal responsibility.

The land here is a blank slate to be painted, so we will need a group of people who know how to manifest and are excited by the resources of the land and can see the infinite possibilities here. At this point in time, there is a 2 bedroom mobile which needs work and some outbuildings. There is a garden space and some fencing for animals.

I see tiny houses, straw bale structures, in ground gnome dwellings...animals, gardens, fruit trees, grannies, babies, critters, educational classes, spiritual rituals, mediation....much laughter, love, spiritual growth and nurturing. The opportunities are endless.....

I would like to see 4 or 5 very strong, very awake &quot;founding members&quot; to start this spring around March. (2016)

I am so, so laid back, and know how to let people be happy, but I do also know about healthy boundaries. I am a good environment!

 If this sounds right and resonates with your intuition, please do call me and let's talk!  530-440-8118.

Love and light!
Priestess Kiete
Check out the temple website. There is not that much there as it is just getting started, but it will give you a feel for my heart. Remember, I am open to all spiritual paths that are kind and loving. I think basic values are more important that traditions or paths when it comes to compatibility.

      <name>Three Little Birds Eco-village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22673&quot;&gt;Three Little Birds Eco-village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Love, peace, and fresh produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/three-little-birds-eco-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/three-little-birds-eco-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Greetings all,

We are currently looking for members to form a self-sufficient, sustainable eco-village in the sunshiny state of Florida! :)
Below is the ideal vision for this community.  Ideas listed are naturally progressing to suit the ever-changing needs of the Earth and its inhabitants.  Please e-mail me if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions.


We advocate love and peace, operating under the &quot;do unto others as you would like them  to do unto you&quot; philosophy.
We practice non-judgment, compassion, and forgiveness, and strive to live in harmony with the Earth and its creatures.

We strive to restore the health of the Earth -- its soil and ecosystems.
We use permaculture practices such as edible landscaping with perennial fruits, vegetables, and bushes.  We use water harvesting and management, mulching to suppress weeds and prevent moisture loss/erosion, and we create rich biomass through composting (including humanure composting).  We also seek to provide habitat for animals, insects, and other critters, and practice the holistic management of animals.

The structures onsite will be made of made of non-toxic, natural materials: cob, straw bale, bamboo, and sustainably harvested wood.   These structures will be equipped to harvest passive energy, including rainwater collection, shading (with trees), creating a wind draft in the buildings, and natural lighting.
We will harvest energy using wind and solar power, and ideally be completely off the grid.
We will also create water filtration systems using plants (drinking water and greywater filtration).

The mental health of our members is important to us, and we advocate positive thinking, being proactive instead of reactive, self-realization, and acting out of love instead of fear or scarcity.
In addition, we feel it is important to value yourself and others as divine expressions of life, and express genuine kindness -- listening, caring, and sharing possessions, time, and ideas.
We foster right speech:  speaking in respectful and uplifting ways to one another.
Overall, we want members to feel safe and respected, and for everyone to respect personal space of others.

Physical health of members is also important, as it greatly affects one's quality of life.
We wish to grow all of our sustenance with permaculture techniques, in rich, nutrient dense soil which is never treated with chemicals, pesticides, or herbicides.
Ideally, members will practice natural and holistic methods of healing, such as use of medicinal herbs, food as medicine, fermented foods, cleanses, sauna, nutrient therapy, reiki healing, and acupuncture.
Exercise is important too, and we encourage members to treat Earth as a playground!  Tree climbing, dancing, yoga, t'ai chi, qi gong, etc.

The spiritual health of members will be nurtured by designated areas for meditation, prayer, and contemplation.  Silent retreats and Karma Yoga retreats are events we would enjoy holding.

Music and the arts feed the soul too!  We advocate creativity in all of its various forms, and will also hold retreats and artist/musician residencies for creative peoples to practice their craft in a healthy, carefree, stress free environment. 

Self-sufficiency and interdependence are important to us.  We wish to create eco-friendly/plant based goods, repurpose &quot;trash&quot;, make functional crafts (basket weaving, ceramics), make non-toxic soap, learn earth skills (sewing, knitting, wild edible foraging), beekeeping, chicken keeping, and food and drink processing (fermented foods, hard cider/mead, vinegar, jams), etc.

Overall, we want to provide members, friends, family, and visitors a safe space to deeply appreciate nature in all of its beautiful manifestations, to practice gratitude and love, and to purely enjoy their time on Earth!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22674&quot;&gt;Aldeas de Paz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; ADP is independent from political, religious or business interests and maintains independence by completely funding and operating its programs with the practical and monetary contributions of volunteers. The community promotes the “Culture of Peace” through enriching cross-cultural exchange for people of all races and nationalities and practices voluntary community service where it provides additional opportunities in educational, recreational and environmental fields and assists its beneficiaries to develop their potential and improve their own lives. ADP Community shares the values of peace, justice and tolerance, fundamentally focusing on the preservation of indigenous cultures and the empowerment of young people while valuing local knowledge and working with cultural sensitivity. ADP Volunteer opportunities are truly the microcosm of a world where people join together giving priority to improving life for humanity and promoting a “Culture of Peace” as a practical way to both prevent and resolve conflict. Volunteers and interns are the driving force of our charity, both through their volunteering and through their financial contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/aldeas-de-paz/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/aldeas-de-paz/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Aldeas de Paz (ADP) is a sustainable and transparent community and grassroots NGO based in Santa Barbara de Samana, the Dominican Republic.  A typical member, volunteer or intern needs to be enthusiastic, willing to learn, ready for a challenge, has a desire to take initiative and dedicates a lot of caring and passion to the position. Friendliness, care, commitment and patience are among important qualities. We welcome individual volunteers, families and groups regardless of age, experience or background. Volunteering with ADP is a great opportunity to work side by side with locals, learn new skills, study Spanish, and immerse oneself in the Latin and indigenous culture. You are interacting with the community, building relationships and making a positive impact. These days the Community is welcoming new permanent members and especially idealistic people are encouraged to join.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22676&quot;&gt;The OASIS Center for Conscious Living&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The OASIS Center for Conscious Living exists to teach new earth living principles and practices and to build community, blending two generations and two cultures.  We adhere to the prophecy of the eagle flying with the condor.  We plan to grow our community both in southern Ecuador and in the sacred valley of Peru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-oasis-center-for-conscious-living/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-oasis-center-for-conscious-living/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;First and foremost we are a teaching center, with a focus on &quot;new earth living.&quot;  This includes the study of the evolution of consciousness of our species, an exploration of ourselves as energetic beings, and the principles and practices of new earth or conscious living.  We have a small farm and animal husbandry program, but will acquire a larger farm space soon for more crops and large animal husbandry.  We plan to establish a trout farm and a beekeeping operation, with the development of a fully self-sustaining community.  We are looking both for elders to help teach and lead the community, as well as young interns who want to learn to live freely and grow as a community together.  We adhere to the prophecy about the eagle flying with the condor, that the mix of North American intellect and masculine efficiency will blend with South American beauty and sweetness, and together we will create a new earth.  We will eventually have a larger farm south of Cuenca, perhaps as far as Vilcabamba, and later establish our full community project outside of Urubamba, Peru. 
One of the ways that we integrate with the local community is by renting our properties from them.  They are the owners and we simply are the stewards.  In this way we not only co-create community with them, but we adhere to a core principle of new earth living, that no individual owns any property of any kind.  We are fully self-sufficient in that we generate all the capital necessary for the community via our internship program and a variety of farming enterprises.  The such enterprise is a program for growing heirloom tomatoes and producing sun-dried tomatoes to sell to the gringo population in Cuenca.</description>

      <name>The Transcendent Zeitgeist Movement (TTZM)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22677&quot;&gt;The Transcendent Zeitgeist Movement (TTZM)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Simple: a chance for true happiness. Peace, Love, Respect, Trust, Togetherness
The following is a link to some FAQ regarding (TZM)  http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-transcendent-zeitgeist-movement-ttzm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-transcendent-zeitgeist-movement-ttzm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;TTZM is currently forming, we are now a small group of people who have been handed some lucky cards. We have a large source of Income to start a Self Sustaining community we are currently in the process of securing a large portion of land around 100+ acres. We currently own 36 acres and are looking to start a town or city depending on how much additional land we can buy in the surrounding area.  At this link there are 2 DVD's that are free and are suggested to gain a complete idea of what we are doing (http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/tool-kit)

The movement's principle focus includes the recognition that the majority of the social problems that plague the human species at this time are not the sole result of some institutional corruption, absolute scarcity, a political policy, a flaw of &quot;human nature&quot; or other commonly held assumptions of causality. Rather, the movement recognizes that issues such as poverty, corruption, pollution, homelessness, war, starvation and the like appear to be &quot;symptoms&quot; born out of an outdated social structure.

While intermediate reform steps and temporal community support are of interest to the movement, the defining goal is the installation of a new socioeconomic model based upon technically responsible resource management, allocation and design through what would be considered the scientific method of reasoning problems and finding optimized solutions.

This “Natural Law/Resource-Based Economy&quot; (NLRBE) is about taking a direct technical approach to social management as opposed to a monetary or even political one. It is about updating the workings of society to the most advanced and proven methods known, leaving behind the damaging consequences and limiting inhibitions which are generated by our current system of monetary exchange, profit, business and other structural and motivational issues.

The movement is loyal to a train of thought, not figures or institutions. The view held is that through the use of socially targeted research and tested understandings in science and technology, we are now able to logically arrive at societal applications that could be profoundly more effective in meeting the needs of the human population, increasing public health. There is little reason to assume war, poverty, most crime and many other monetarily-based scarcity effects common in our current model cannot be resolved over time. The range of the movement's activism and awareness campaigns extend from short- to long-term, with methods based explicitly on non-violent methods of communication.

The Zeitgeist Movement has no allegiance to any country or traditional political platforms. It views the world as a single system and the human species as a single family and recognizes that all countries must disarm and learn to share resources and ideas if we expect to survive in the long run. Hence, the solutions arrived at and promoted are in the interest to help everyone on Earth, not a select group.

 It is recommended to do some research on Peter Joseph and his Ideals. Because we have the same vision currently we are seeking families as well as educated individuals as follows: Engineers, Mechanics, Carpenters, Botanists, Doctors, Teachers, Electricians, Plumbers and many more. The deal is we will provide everything you need. We will build you a house and a school for your kids. But we need ground breakers as well as people willing to help work. We are accepting applications now. Please contact Aaron with any questions. Thank you and We Love you:) Note: will update this page as progress is made.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22679&quot;&gt;Anatopia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We want to be a living example of permaculture and community living where we all help one another to have e fun and meaningful life :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/anatopia/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/anatopia/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We, Ana and Charlie, think that living together in community improves living in many ways. It's about helping each other and not being lonely.
Ana is from Belgium and as a youth experienced living/working in communities in England and Belgium. She got married, however, and her dream got put on hold. She is a holistic nutritionist, herbalist, and eco-gardener who loves to create a better, more compassionate, sustainable, and peaceful world for animals, plants, and humans. 
Charlie is young dude, who in 2010 biked across America, and along the way became exposed to communities and ecovillages practicing a simpler way of life. Since then, it has been his mission to not only reconnect with these simpler lifeways, but to form a community where this is the norm. He loves permaculture, yurt building, woodworking, and gardening, and hopes to form some sort of community-based business from these passions.
Our four-acre property is situated in the woods north of Elkton, MD. We have cats, dogs, chickens, and sheep.. We have 5 bedrooms in a large house, a yurt, a camper, and much space available for tents (season permitting).

      <name>7 Lakes Ranch</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22680&quot;&gt;7 Lakes Ranch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; 7 Lakes Ranch strives to bring back trust in our neighbors and our community, allowing our children to grow up in a spiritual and agricultural based community where our neighbors are friends and we all strive to better each other.  A modern day Mayberry, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/7-lakes-ranch/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/7-lakes-ranch/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Owners will discover 7 Lakes Ranch, a self sustainable, agricultural based ranch community, on approximately 600 acres of refined Texas Hill Country landscape, as a place to call their own in Harper, Texas. It will be recognized as a place where modern day homesteaders share a common interest in their neighbors and strive to build a truly sustainable, intentional community. Each land owner will be deeded their own lot (2-10 acres) upon purchase and this grants them a shared ownership interest in the entire ranch and the multifaceted cooperative corporation as well. Amenities will be similar to those found in other ranch communities such as common areas like parks, the grand lodge (with included day spa and fitness center), swimming pool, rod and gun club, equestrian club, expedition club and eventually a functioning &quot;Old West&quot; themed town with various shops found along the streets to buy sell and trade with the other neighbors in the community and with outside visitors. The targeted demographics will be those interested in building a working self sustaining organic homestead with individual vegetable gardens, edible and native Texas landscapes, a milk cow or goat(s) if you desire, combined with common fields for grains and other large crops, fruit and nut orchards, etc. ... An organic grass-fed community cattle and bison operation will be established for fresh meat, along with limited hunting on the ranch.

Restrictions on building types will developed to maintain property values as well as outline the various
redundant systems to be installed to maintain operability in all scenerios. To ease grid dependency, homes will utilize solar and wind technologies, back up generators, dual electric/gas appliances, rain water harvesting, grey water recycling and most homes will be built using 80-90% reclaimed materials.  Residents will find their dreams are as grand as the Texas sky and adventures abound in every season. Memories will be created to last a lifetime at Texas’ most exclusive luxury ranch community. Texas Outdoor Pursuits is in the business of developing and operating the 7 Lakes Ranch, a rustic but elegant and luxurious venue dedicated to sustainable living, tourism, vacations, business hospitality, farming and livestock production. A world away from the majority of ranch communities in Texas, 7 Lakes Ranch will be a new concept in sustainable living communities while striking a perfect balance between active outdoor recreation, economic sustainability, environmental stewardship, philanthropy and the rigorous preservation of the Western way of life. With a substantial expanse of land, the Texas ranch is committed to harmoniously balancing the needs of the residents, guests, wildlife, livestock, the land and watershed through an ongoing land, river, pond and rangeland restoration management plan.

We are currently looking for 40 families to start and will expand as money allows and neighboring properties can be purchased.  Lots begin at $250,000. Contact us for more information, serious inquiries only please.</description>

We are looking at purchasing 160 acres near Williams, Oregon, to build a sustainable, off-the-grid community and start a Healing and Educational Center for our own children and other youth!

We are committed to teaching the world's children, about sustainable living, organic gardening and agriculture, living lightly with the land, natural building, compassionate care of wildlife, conservation of natural resources, edible wild plants, natural medicine, yoga and personal wellness, nutrition, spirituality, interpersonal relationships, effective communication, and so much more- concerning real-world skills to prepare them for their futures. Our Dream is to make the changes necessary for a positive  difference in the future of our World!

Our initial plans include a handful of natural dwellings, we are looking at Yurts, Cobb and Straw-Bale houses to start with, with the possibility of a larger communal space that includes a library, dining hall, temple/yoga space, and kitchen, where we would prepare nutritious meals that are 100% organic and grown on-site!

Some of the other goals we have for the beginning of this project are rainwater collection, recycling gray water via a filtering garden system, solar heating and cooling, composting toilets, solar bathing facilities, and utilizing wind and/or water generated energies.

We are beginning this year to grow a large enough organic, GMO-Free garden to generate most if not all of the food for the families on-site, as well as traveling to local farmer's markets and the possibility of our own CSA.

This is a dream we have all been compiling for years, to exist outside the confines of traditional society and 'get back' to a more harmonious way of life. Help us prove the possibility of an existence without mindless consumerism, and of a symbiotic relationship with our wonderful planet. Because, right now, our Earth needs it! Thank you so much for reading about us!

Finding the correct balance between spiritual and material knowledge that encompasses a holistic, simple, yet comfortable lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-settlement/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-settlement/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Outside of Mullumbimby, NSW, near Byron Bay
Our community is a 5 acre share existing within a larger community.

We are two vegans living a lifestyle that is cruelty free for animals, good for the planet and for ourselves.

We are:
Paul:  Interested in new age/mystical and spiritual philosophy, music, engineering, building, and organic food production.
Vyvyan: Interested in political science, Christianity, history and common law.

We have two cottages that we built ourselves and 2 caravans. Our property is off the grid.

Paul has many organic vegetable plots and lives mainly off food he grows. His home is completely solar powered - the north facing roof is actually made of solar panels. He has plans to build a large geodesic dome, and people are welcome to get involved. It will be used for meditation and dance, as a performance space and music studio, as well as for meetings and workshops. WWOOFers and couch surfers can stay there too.

Vyvyan’s cottage is au naturale. He prefers not to use electricity and mobile phones. 
We have good views, rainforest, subtropical  weather, organic fruit and veg, a pond with singing birds and frogs, as well as lots of peace and quiet.

There is opportunity to learn about building shelters and growing food. 
We are open to holding workshops that cover topics like self sufficiency and survivalism, minimum eco-impact living, spirituality, music and renewable energy.

Best if you bring a tent. There is space to camp and maybe space in a caravan. Paul offers the use of electricity, his induction cooker, and solar hot water for baths under the stars.</description>

We're eco-conscious and dedicated to social justice, personal growth, and fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/quercus/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/quercus/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Quercus is an urban, income-sharing commune forming in Richmond, VA. We are dedicated to ecological conservation, social justice, personal growth, and leading lives of beauty, agency, and fun.

We hold our land, labor, income and other resources in common, and distribute them according to the needs of our members. We promote a strong culture of proactive interpersonal communication and strive for our members to develop strong relationships, both with one another and our surrounding community. We govern ourselves via consensus decision making, and we’re dedicated to dismantling systems of arbitrary hierarchy, wherever they may be found. Ultimately, we wish for our project, and those of similar principles, to be endeavors of growth and reach, so that egalitarianism might spread further into the world.

Not-so- ideological interests and hobbies of current Quercus members include, but are not limited to: Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Acro-Yoga, Yarn Bombing, and Bicycle Flash Mobs.

We currently have four core members and are searching for a couple more, along with as many allies as we can find. We moved in October 1, 2015. Let us know in what ways you're interested.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22688&quot;&gt;Farmpound&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We grow things to eat so we don't have to go as far to get them.
We use things that other people throw away so we don't have to buy them.
We live together so we can get more done and have rewarding social lives.
People need food, things, and company to complete their lives. We want to have more time and resources for fun things so we work as a team to provide ourselves with necessities.
We live at the Farmpound.
So can you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/farmpound/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/farmpound/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We're an eclectic group of people looking for somebody who shares some of our goals. We want to live, grow, and learn together. Some of our job titles include mechanic, military, entrepreneur, jack-of-all-trades, artist, boat builder, and entomologist, but what brings us together is a desire to care for the land, and use what is available as a resource that can be renewed.

Chickens and ducks roam the property, taking care of bugs and providing eggs for all who live here. Gardenscapes expand out from the house, weaving between the barn, the greenhouse, the chicken coops, and the pond. Both useful and beautiful plants provide residents with nourishment for the body and soul. Over 100 fruit, nut, or medicinal plants have been planted throughout the property. People have both privacy and places to meet on the property. We maintain a hot tub, host movie nights on a projector, light the occasional bonfire, and some even attend fairs and karaoke together.

We're still learning. Established in 2012, the property has been a site for DIY skill, social, design, and garden experimentation. Some parts of the property are under construction, and others are thriving. A mix of business, education, and enjoyment drive the development of the overall suburban homestead forward.

The rent is a little less than comparable rooms because you'll be expected to contribute some efforts to the betterment of the whole. This will not impact your ability to maintain a job or social life outside of the community. Residents give 5-10 hours a week, leading and contributing to projects and chores. Shared spaces are expected to be kept clean and organized. Other projects include animal upkeep, garden care, trash/recycling, event/party planning, and construction projects.

Livestock-friendly animals are welcome, with some coordination. Rent includes utilities. There is a monthly project budget for needed group resources like seeds, construction materials, research, bees, etc. The allocation of funds is decided at weekly Sunday meetings. We've brewed beer, kept bees, made compost, constructed greenhouses, welded stoves, created swales, raised pigs, goats, and sheep, engineered coops, and bartered with neighbors.

Does this sound like a place you'd like to visit? Live? Thrive?
If so, great. Please send an email telling us a little about yourself, and we'll get back to you within a day or so if you seem like you might be a good fit.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22690&quot;&gt;Elemental Kindom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We wish to inspire a way of life which is a symbiosis with the Four Elements. We recognize that we are comprised of these elements hence it is of high importance that they are present in our daily life in their purity. Clean forest air, fresh living spring water, organic soil and nourishing sunlight are all part of our &quot;diet&quot;. Grounding and living close to the Earth we cherish all life. We live connected to El Navarro conservation area with in  high altitude landscape and this preservation efforts are also internal as we wish to revive the ways of being that heeds to the elemental wisdom and brings humanity into peaceful collaboration through creative arts and permacultural abundance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/elemental-kindom/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/elemental-kindom/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We believe in environmental conservation and an integral connection with the natural environment. 
Through this connection and inclusion of raw and wild food from the immediate surroundings as well as clean spring water our community can thrive being physically and spiritually connected to the landscape.
Elemental Kindom is a vision of community based on values of true co-operation with the elements as well as each other. Honoring the good in all and recognizing the divine spark in each being we envision an ecovillage based on principles of Prima Culture. The original divine matrix of creation is alive in all of us as in all of life on this planet. It is through honoring this thread of life that connects all beings and elements can humans truly live in peace and share gracefully.
We invite those with a vision of a creative simple life and wish to co-create a future based on compassion and exchange of virtues all in accordance with natural synthesis which teaches us how to collaborate peacefully and organically in a common purpose of preserving the landscape and the elements for the Future Generations. A tree in a jungle hosts much life and is decorated with mosses and polyps and a sloth sitting on it is just as much a part of it as we are a part of the Earth. They are all thriving in unity and not fighting for the blessing of rainwater. We are comprised of the elements, therefore in our blueprint we are the living in an unobstructed connection with the goodness which gives life to all and nourishes our hearts with limitless beauty of every living breath beholding the purity of communion with the totality of Earth's Elemental Kindom.
We honor our rich Slavic roots and Indigenous wisdom from around the globe which are very much in touch with the celebration of the elemental life through the integration of the natural holistic wisdom into the daily living. Inspired by ancestral wisdom and such writings as &quot;Ringing Cedars&quot; as well as the direct experience of the elements, we invite you to rekindle your ancestral memory by living closer to the ways of our not so distant forebearers. Opening up your senses to the fullness of creation. The music of the birdsong and the ever-changing artwork of nature's paintbrush- all are humble guides on our life journey within the Elemental Kindom of Gaia.
We invite you to experience and connect with the elements as the part of the Kindom, not as outside observers, rather as active co-creators of the bounty of life. You are one with the elements - rewild your essence and celivebrate and vibrate in a natural frequency.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22691&quot;&gt;Fiori Hill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Mission Statement:

“Fiori Hill creates a legacy for home ownership through respect-for-sustainability, socially diverse, and community-oriented residences that strive to balance the private comforts of home with the larger connections created by utilizing pocket neighborhoods. The community is designed for people of all ages because of its universal live-in-place home design and integrated neighborhood character.”   

Seldom does a small community create such a big impression. We listened to what people really want and recognized that a large gap existed between what many building companies supply and what folks really want, need or can afford. Lifestyle and home is more than a house on its lot.

“Fiori” is Italian for “flower”, and this tree &amp;amp; flower-filled hillside community is reminiscent of the old village charm nicely tucked away in Hillsborough.  Fiori Hill is bringing the reality of homeownership and community to the front and center with its design, integration, unique community amenities and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/fiori-hill/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/fiori-hill/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Fiori Hill, located on 17+ acres in Hillsborough, is a new, planned neighborhood of mixed-size homes dedicated to create a sense of place and true neighborhood. Conveniently located just west of the Forest Ridge community off Hwy 70 Business and ¼ mile east of Hwy 86, with close proximity to the I-40-85 corridor, shopping and restaurants, Fiori Hill awaits.  It offers a feeling of home that incorporates the vision of a true “Village Pocket Neighborhood”. 

Designed around the principal elements of timeless community, Fiori Hill has been carefully created to preserve the natural elements on the site including large open spaces, mature trees, and creeks so often forgotten in most communities. Walkable trails are planned to connect the neighborhood to local amenities. Homeowners will share common spaces, inter-community trails, and gardens that build community, activity, and security, and allow residents to enjoy the neighborhood in its truest form. 

Fiori Hill homes will vary in size from 1200 to 2300 SF with integrated design, energy efficiency, well-crafted construction, authentic styling and discreet parking. High-quality construction, charm and affordability will enhance the neighborhood rather than volume, repetition, and separation. Many of the homes will incorporate energy-efficient flexible basements in the building design and provide storage and potential for living expansion.</description>

We operate off grid. It is hard to define what we do, but generally we homestead.  

Our mission statement is too long to fit below, so here is a summery; to create a place where one can directly experience what it takes to be free. To be a place of creation, where imagination can reach for the sky, while keeping our feet firmly planted. To become an ever evolving community that makes shifts in behavior based on what nature is providing. To be a catalyst for lasting change in our culture, local and global. To create leaders in the community that make decisions based on the short term as well as the long term effects on the community and beyond.  To revive wholesome traditions like food harvest celebrations. To have food celebrations regulary, pooling our efforts to make the most of the opportunity for fun, food, and learning.  To ensure that our actions on our land dont negatively affect any creature or natural resource down hill or down the line of time.  To create an abundance of food, friends, and good times, but also create hard work, discipline, and responsibility.</description>

To live and learn about the fun and friendship gained by living in an intentional community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ecovillage-dungeness-valley/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ecovillage-dungeness-valley/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a new Ecovillage forming with the design of CoHousing where each family will own their own property in clustered housing in the Sequim Dungeness Valley.  Our goal is to purchase 20-100 acres with the vision of some or all of the following:  Educational and Healing facilities, incorporating the latest in technology for self-sufficiency, like hydroponics, solar energy, small-scale hydroelectric supply from river or creek, self-composting toilets, organic farming; learning/lecture hall; outdoor survival workshops, Co-op businesses including Restaurant and much, much more.

We are interested in 38 acres to save an old diary farm.  It has one huge beautiful barn, 1 wood milking barn, a metal milking barn, 2 exiting homes that are livable and a variety of dairy supported building including a huge silo.  The land has an irrigation ditch running through it also.  There are many possibilities as Sequim is in the sunblet of the Olympic Mountains.</description>

The building is set up to be able to do arts that are not easy to set up in an individual house or apartment:  pottery, glass work, printmaking, jewelry, wood work, sculpture, metalsmithing.  It is set up so that we can live and work here even if we had to have some job on the outside to survive we could still live for our art.  I was looking at commercial property in Waterloo, Iowa, and there was a Nursing home for sale.  Everybody gets a room and there is room for studio space.  The entryway/dayroom is the gallery.  Who could ask for anything more?</description>

Looking for a group of like-minded mothers interested in sustainable living, alternative lifestyles, shared parenting, spirituality and living in harmony with life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/mother-tribe-in-nyc/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/mother-tribe-in-nyc/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I want to create a community of women in NYC — a space for living, sharing and raising children together. Next spring I will be moving to NYC with my 12-year-old daughter – we have spent the last 5 years in the Indian Himalaya’s working with women and communities and now the universe calls us to something new. Without a plan, we are leaping into the unknown, trusting in the divine and following our hearts. My greatest wish is to connect with other like-minded women — sharing journeys, stories and the tapestry of life as it unfolds together.
I would love to hear from other courageous women who would be interested in co-creating and sharing this journey with us in NYC.</description>

      <name>St. Joseph Farm</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22700&quot;&gt;St. Joseph Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; MISSION
St. Joseph Farm is a Catholic intentional community of young adults striving for holiness within modern society by building our daily lives upon the four gospel cornerstones of prayer, service, simplicity, and community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/st-joseph-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/st-joseph-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;VISION
We will be centered on the Eucharist and open to the Spirit.  We will resist the popular culture as much as it is a “culture of death” and participate in it as much as it is a “culture of life.”  We will respond to the needs of our local community and seek solidarity with the ones we serve as they lead us into a closer relationship with Christ.

With St. Joseph as our patron, we will especially seek to reflect and promote ideas often associated with him:  Just, quiet, chaste, teacher, protector, and carpenter.
•	In being just we will seek to live out Catholic Social Teachings, recognizing the dignity of all human life and creation.
•	In being quiet we will seek simplicity and humility in our actions, for “the fruit of silence is prayer.” 
•	In being chaste we will reject a popular culture of sexual objectification to allow ourselves, with clean hearts, to “see God.” 
•	In being teachers we will provide opportunities to others for spiritual and practical growth.
•	In being protectors we will both seek sustainability as stewards of God’s creation and defend the most vulnerable in society, for “the Church considers matters concerning the environment and its protection intimately linked to the theme of integral human development.” 
•	In being carpenters we will work, often with our hands in the garden or home repair projects, and we will recognize the dignity of human work.</description>

      <name>Biblical Living Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22701&quot;&gt;Biblical Living Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our community focus is to serve God and others. You must be a Christian, or be in the process of accepting Jesus as your Savior. Must be willing to work for the good of the community as well as helping keep the safety of the families in the communities. If you have a criminal background, you must be able to prove that you have turned your life around and have committed yourself to God. Racism, bad attitude, laziness, cockiness, bossiness, ones that cannot or are not willing to be part of a team will NOT be accepted. 

We would be willing to accept polygamist, (husband with several wives), the Bible doesn't say that Polygamy is a sin, however, only Bible-believing polygamist will be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/biblical-living-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/biblical-living-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I am an Ordained Minister; my husband and I have 4 children live in our home, ages 14 to 2.  With our country being very violent, separated, Christians' rights being taken, freedom of speech being taken, our rights to bare arms at risk, laws being put in place that goes against what God teaches us, we have decided to see if we could find like-minded people to start a community. 

Our hopes and dreams are to find Christians who believe that it is time for Christians to start taking measures to prepare for persecution as believers of the Word of God. We in no way are trying to be end-of-the-world preppers, we are simply trying to start a community where Christians can be safe and can have supplies that can sustain us. 

We know that a community like this will take some time to get going, and it will take time to complete. However, we are in construction phase of finding Christians that are just wanting to serve God, but be safe. 

Our hopes are to have the community in a state like TN. Where we can somewhat be on high ground, but yet be able to be in a place that is not in a major city. We are open to suggestions about any part of this future community.

Our vision is for everyone to have their own homes, however, be willing to have gatherings a couple times a week. 

We hope to have either a home-church or have an actual church on or near the property. 

We will ask for church tithes to maintain the church, community, to serve surrounding communities. However, if one is unable to give, we do understand, but we would ask that you give in other ways, such as volunteering for extra work. 

We have not yet decided on if the church would on the community or if it will be up to each family. I would like to see the church own land and each individual put their own homes on the property. However, it really is going to come to how many people will join and where the community will be.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22704&quot;&gt;Sunflower Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Encouraging others to understand the benefits of following a healthy, mutually supportive, sustainable lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sunflower-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sunflower-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Sunflower Cohousing currently has four members, and we are looking for others to join us in an environmentally conscious cohousing project. We have recently purchased a property in a small hamlet near Champagne-Mouton in France, where there is an infant’s school, doctor, pharmacy, post office, and supermarket. The property comprises a modernised 2-bedroomed house, with stone barns on both sides and a hangar, all facing into a central grassed courtyard. 

We have started to convert one of the barns into 2 small, self-contained cottage-style houses. We also have consent for 3 additional houses, and plans for 2 larger family dwellings. Each house will have its own private garden space to the rear, and a semi-private patio area to the front, facing onto the courtyard.  The new houses are all highly insulated, with solar heating pipes under the tiles of a sealed roofing system, and with wood-fired back-boilers producing heat and hot water from regenerative sources.

One section of the barns will house a community building, with a larger kitchen and dining/meeting area, craft room, a laundry, office space, and additional bedroom space for visitors. There is also an existing workshop area, machinery bay, and garden tool workshop, all of which will be incorporated into the community space.

We have started to create a community vegetable garden (our potager) and a new orchard in an adjoining 4 acre field which is also owned by the community. We intend to keep a small selection of livestock on this field, to complement the chickens and geese that already share our space.

We are working towards an ecologically friendly lifestyle, and to be self-sufficient where possible, but we also recognise that true self-sufficiency is very labour intensive, and so we try to achieve a sensible balance in order that we may also enjoy life. We have a range of systems already in place – composting bins, worm bins, aquaponics, vegetable and fruit production – and are constantly looking at ways to improve upon our arrangements but also to minimise our impact on the surrounding countryside. 
ᅠ
Between us, we have gained experience in developing permaculture systems and organic practices in the UK and Spain, in both wet and arid conditions and would be looking to introduce and expand upon those techniques as part of the production of food for the community. We also have a wide range of practical and creative skills, such as building, IT, animal husbandry, fleece spinning, weaving and knitting, willow weaving, preserving, sewing, dying, and basket making.

We are looking for others with a similar outlook on life to come and join us. Investing members will be asked to match our own investment to date (we are not looking to make a profit), and will in return receive an equal share and an equal say in the ownership and development of the community as a whole. We will also be constructing houses to rent for social members who will have an equal say and commitment to the community save for voting on capital expenditure.</description>

Since its birth in 1964, Wilderland has become one of New Zealand's most prominent sustainable communities. An ever-evolving resident-group maintains the land and holds the space for hundreds of volunteers from around the world to come and learn together every year.

Wilderland takes a holistic perspective. All aspects of living off the land, from the soil right through to the facebook page, are part of an integrated system of full self-sufficiency. All aspects are aimed towards a future of true low-impact living, true self-reliance, and real local economy.

We are a work in progress. Since the beginning, volunteers have had the chance to come and be part of developing our unique model, learning so much as we go. After more than 50 years, we have a lot to share, and a focus on sharing it with as many people as possible.

We are especially interested in forming partnerships with educational institutions around the world who would like to send groups of students here, for an in-depth holistic sustainability experience. Check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eStPg1GdQZs to see an inspiring example of one such partnership, and get in touch if you would like to know more.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22709&quot;&gt;New York Kibbutz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We live out our Jewish values through education, spiritual practice, respect for the earth, tikkun olam and artistic expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/jewish-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/jewish-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;See www.facebook.com/newyorkkibbutz for the most up-to-date information. Right now we have facilities for Shabbatons and other gatherings, where like-minded souls meet regularly. A property is being sought after by myself and others for a Intentional Jewish Community. Our current resources enable us to have gatherings year-round. Many people have an ideal notion of Community without ever having hands-on experience to determine if they enjoy the lifestyle. Another obstacle to living Intentionally is the difficulty in forming relations with those who not only share the same values but are committed to living in an Intentional Community. An opportunity thus is provided for individuals and families who are considering Intentional Community, to live in and experience community for a week, a month, a season. Bonds will be formed and a network will be created. Living together on a part-time basis will help to determine where, with whom, and how we want to live together before making a dramatic, life-altering decision to join an IC. In this fashion we will slowly but surely reach a critical mass of people and resources. This network will then begin the process of forming a permanent community in the place of our choosing.</description>

Now our mission is to continue as a model community and bring true sustainability to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/saint-michaels-eco-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/saint-michaels-eco-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a functional sustainable community with a large surplus of food and water.  We built the community years before the aqueduct was brought to our area.  We have springs, rainwater collection, clean streams that start in our community, and many water storage cisterns (one is the first floor of a building, but you would never know unless you were told).  On any given day we could provide food to feed over 50,000 people.   Our design is to use as little labor as possible.  Currently, the work crew is the owner and a local family of 3.  

Intentional design integration touches every part of our community.  Homes are built beyond LEED standards.  All homes have either a rainwater collection roof or a livingroof or a hybrid of both.  The landscaping is edible, for utility, and full of medicinal plants.  We grow the medicines for ourselves and our animals.  Our Permaculture Country Club is unlike any other Country Club in the most important ways possible.  Our course takes people though a food forest.  It uses no purchased water or toxic chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides.  The course has examples of regenerative agriculture, sustainability,  and permaculture at every hole.  It hosts the National Disc Golf Championship of Costa Rica every July.   We are a community that produces more than we consume.</description>

Our design will facilitate spontaneous connection, and a balance between private and community needs.
Our community will be located in an urban setting walking distance to public transportation, cafes, shops, and green spaces.
Our community will be inclusive and welcoming to all people.
We will be a cohesive community focusing on care, respect and helpfulness, sharing resources for elder and child care.
We foster participation by all through shared meals, joint projects and group celebrations.
We support an ecologically sustainable lifestyle that reduces our carbon footprint through energy efficiency.
We promote good communication and conflict resolution through group decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/urban-village-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/urban-village-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;URBAN VILLAGE COHOUSING

We are a new community (Fall 2015) forming in the Greater Boston Area.

We are seeking an urban site to build on or an existing building suitable to rehab into 25-30 units averaging 1000sf.
We hope to be a multi-generational community.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22717&quot;&gt;Tortuga Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Building a counter-weight to centralization, mindless consumption, global decline, without losing sight of modern achievements such as the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/tortuga-bay/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/tortuga-bay/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We decided it was time to stop watching the global decline and to start acting. So we are emigrating to found an ecovillage community.

Our goals are: 1) counter-acting global centralization, 2) preserving nature and local resources 3) become as autonomous and resilient as possible 4) build a haven where people are free to diversify and create, without having to fear for their livelihood.

To do this, we need people of like mind.

We anticipate the transition-town is going to combine EarthBag structures, diverse agriculture ranging from traditional forestry to modern aquaponics, community-owned energy, heating and water infrastructure and (of course) internet access.

The plan is to keep the community below ~120 people to not exceed Dunbar's Number and thus maximize the ease of self-governance. When it comes to rules, we prefer a hands-off approach.  Cultivation of nature and tolerance towards each other are usually enough, no cultural or societal norms need be set.

We are also considering joining an existing community or village to have an easier start, if we can find one that matches our ideals. (Communities that try to enforce a certain way of life are usually not a good fit.) If you think you know a place, we look forward to hearing it.

And if any of this sounds interesting to you, we're looking forward to talking to you.</description>

We are forming a new country based on theocratic republic form of government run by President-Pastor-and King.  The government leadership is hereditary in the family leadership voted approval by residents.  All are direct vote system in politics.

At this present time, we do not have any land or islands.  We are presently working on raising funds to purchase tropical island or &quot;no man's land&quot; or Terra Nullius.

The denomination is none.  Just our own church we call, Church of the Trinity of God and our version of the Knights Templar for men and for the boys, Boy Scouts (not associated with BSA) that we believe true to the Scout's Law and Oath as well as the Knights Oath.

We are quite opposite of United States's direction of politics today such as with what is happening with churches, pastors, bakeries, etc.  We are very Conservative.

To qualify, please notify me for further instruction on how to become citizen of TRSSS and requirements which is very detailed.  

Once secured location, then there will be establishment, new flag, submission to international community to recognize us, etc.

Your involvement will be necessary in daily life in the community with your skills anywhere from farming and family up to government leaderships.

Since this is tropical region, we will have resorts, Olympics quality sporting facilities, and farming (tropical food and seafood).

We will have high tech although some things pretty basic as well.

Prior purchasing, your involvement and citizenship application fees will greatly assist in the process but your own home is at your own expense.  Homes will be based on our own design (President of TRSSS is a Designer and CAD Drafter).  

If room or additional lands, we can consider manufacturing, stores, dealers, etc just like in your hometown.</description>

Our urban location is ideal, convenient to shopping, good public schools, universities, public transportation, and bike lanes into Boston.

We come to this community as individuals with our own aspirations, values, and experiences. At the same time we recognize that the art of successful life in a cooperative community is dependent upon building healthy capacities for compromise. We seek to live in community, learning from each other, respecting our differences and resolving the inevitable conflicts that will arise from these differences. Kindness, compassion, and respect are the foundation for our interactions. We are committed to engaging in honest, direct, and respectful communication with each other.

Many of our members have been here for our history, since 1973, with new members bringing energy and commitment along the way. We’ve raised children together and now most of us are retired, enjoying grandchildren, family visits, travel and social occasions, as well as the cultural life of the city. 

We share celebrations and support one another through losses. We gather for community events in our common room as well as our beautiful yard and gardens. We have off-street parking for one car per household. Many people stop on their walk to the “T” to smell our roses or choose a book from the Little Free Library.

Members own the building and land cooperatively, each household owning shares based on square footage. Shareholders rotate terms serving on the Board of Directors. We work together on committees and projects, including planning, maintenance, gardening, and social events. In our monthly meetings, we share perspectives and concerns, and make decisions by consensus.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22720&quot;&gt;Binary Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The purpose of this community is to alternate capitalism with a self-sufficient economy, based on the theory that man needs both in order to fulfill his intrinsically ambivalent nature, i.e. respectively the &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;static&quot; ones (please refer to my blog if you have the patience to read it ) .
I plan to expand its presence worldwide .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/binary-model/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/binary-model/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The &quot;static area&quot;  (as I call it) is represented by an overgrown gently sloping hazelnut grove and woodland which ends in a strip of plain , bordered by a delightful creek which (usually) runs all year long, providing for the irrigation of vegetables and corn fields. The land is set in a national park, so all manner of wild animals including wild boar roam freely and hunting is allowed.
The adjacent lands are all abandoned and can therefore be purchased at  very moderate prices, thus allowing the potential expansion of the community up to about a 4 hectare area in total.
There is also a spontaneous spring which runs all year except in summer and a well can be easily dug (probably even by hand) as water is a few meters below the surface. 
The climate is very temperate due to the low altitude and surrounding woodland. 
Construction would be allowed if one of the adjacent lands were to be purchased, as it is sufficiently far away from the stream.
It's also possible to connect to the grid, but solar energy is more in line with my purpose.
As everywhere in Italy, civilization is always very near. Yet, this place is, by its orography, very private. Although there are farms and people all around , the sensation of being fully immersed in a solitary wilderness is overwhelming.
I build everything with what I have at hand. I have recently constructed a gross but extremely functional chicken coop which neither foxes or weasels have succeeded in penetrating in spite of their obvious endeavors. The laying hens I raised in it , which are free to roam the land by day, appear to have developed an unusual wisdom and balance which make them very friendly and disciplined. They are so confident that they like to hitch rides on my shoulders or follow me around while they hunt for insects and grubs.
I get my internet connectivity only via a mobile 3G signal on a tablet which I charge via solar .

The idea is to move into this environment permanently, albeit gradually. For the time being, I still have a convenient  umbilical chord tying me to the &quot;civilized&quot; world by dint of a comfortable villa located about 8 miles from said wilderness, which I can reach even by bicycle. This large house is composed by three independent areas all equipped with relevant kitchens and bathrooms. This is an urban dwelling (albeit situated in the country, 15 miles from Rome) and offers perfect connectivity to internet, mobile and landline, apart from breathtaking views, a lovely garden with fruit trees and a swimming pool. From there, I occasionally jet off to wherever I can find I.T. contract work in Europe. My intention is to turn part of this house into a language school ( I'm fluent in five )  and cooking workshop with B&amp;amp;B or hostel facility .

I would ideally prefer to join forces with people who would like to participate in this venture. They wouldn't have to contribute financially , although that would be my preference , but would need to help me take care of the villa and the land, especially when I'm away for work. 
I would ideally like to purchase a flat land that would allow for taking off and landing with an ultralight aircraft and keeping a couple of horses, but although I don't lack the funds, this would have to be found at some distance from my present farmland, as the landscape would not allow for it.
I am also poised to purchase a small sailboat to moor in British waters, with which to escape on long sailing trips.
Self-sufficiency, in my mind, also includes transportation ...
And this project is very much about play and adventure as well, so the above would not be incoherent with it.
I have some funds  available for all of this. It's more a matter of energy, enthusiasm  and sharing.</description>

Baltimore Free Farm strives to promote urban agriculture, sustainability, and permaculture through the creation of green spaces and community sanctuaries which utilize reclaimed materials whenever possible. By providing entertainment, educational opportunities, and ethically produced food to local residents, we hope to instill a sense of pride in one's community and its ability to sustain itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/baltimore-free-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/baltimore-free-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Baltimore Free Farm is an egalitarian collective of gardeners and activists who aim to provide access to healthy food for all.

Horizontal Housing Co. is a non-stock corporation formed by members of Baltimore Free Farm in 2013. Because Baltimore Free Farm is a project under the umbrella of the 501-c3 organization Fusion Partnerships, it cannot collectively purchase property. The sole purpose of Horizontal Housing Co. is to purchase property for utilization by Baltimore Free Farm members as either gardening space or housing. In 2012, our good friend and Baltimore Free Farm member Paul Pojman passed away, leaving behind a house which BFF collective members lived in but did not own. Working in conjunction with Paul’s family members and NASCO, an organization which helps co-ops and housing collectives purchase property, Horizontal Housing was able to purchase this property and continue housing several BFF members on campus.

In addition, Horizontal Housing was able to purchase two lots from the city that are a part of Baltimore Free Farm’s gardening space. Like much of Hampden, these lots were under threat of housing development before Horizontal Housing was awarded the rights to purchase the land and it will now remain part of our garden for many years to come.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22722&quot;&gt;Living Miracles Worldwide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Miracle of Forgiveness: Enlightenment is experience of What Is, the falling away of the concept of a separate self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/living-miracles-worldwide/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/living-miracles-worldwide/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Living Miracles Community began in 2009 in rural Utah, in the Strawberry River Canyon area. Today the community exists in Kamas and the Strawberry River Canyon, Utah, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Chapala, Mexico.

This group of devoted brothers and sisters live simple devotional lives, hosting retreats, events, and devotional stays and traveling where invited to share gatherings that inspire and bless all who seek peace of mind and enlightenment. They are often referred to as &quot;Messengers of Peace.&quot; Acknowledging that truth is in the Mind, they offer an invitation to engage in the uncovering of the beliefs that seem to obstruct the awareness of love’s presence.

They meet with those who desire to discern between the ego’s thought system and the Holy Spirit’s purpose of forgiveness. The purpose of the gatherings remains unchanged: learning the Spirit’s purpose of forgiveness and awakening to Peace, Happiness, and Freedom.

They serve as mighty companions for each other and recognize that awakening is not a casual endeavor, but one that demands a deliberate and uncompromising commitment. The depth of devotion and faith reflect their willingness to question all assumptions. Total transformation of the mind is approached with passion and devotion and a burning desire from within. This is their unified goal and purpose.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22723&quot;&gt;Ananda Laurelwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Ananda Laurelwood offers the opportunity to live in community with other inspired, like-minded people who share a foundation in universal spiritual principles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ananda-laurelwood/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ananda-laurelwood/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Since 1968, Ananda has been a pioneer in small, conscious communities. Beginning with Ananda Village, this pattern of life has spread around the globe, with Ananda communities in Europe and India as well as here in the US. Ananda Portland has had a community in town since 1993, and it serves as a sister to Ananda Center at Laurelwood.  

Building a small community is an art, born of experience, character development, time, commitment and joy. Using the resources at hand, an individual can have direct experience of every aspect of community life at Ananda Laurelwood while also developing the spiritual and character qualities which make for supportive leadership, creative management, dynamic involvement and a richly evolving community life.  Situated in a beautiful pastoral valley, our surrounding farm, gardens, forest and wild-lands provide natural beauty, quiet, and a buffer from the conflicting vibrations of more urban environments. Yet when the world beckons, Portland is just a short drive away.  

Our 55-acre educational campus hosts a Meditation and Yoga Retreat center, a growing organic farm with wwoof opportunities and weekly public volunteer projects, a fully residential internship program, and certification programs in vegetarian cooking and conscious compassion-based eldercare.   Our center is a place of learning and connection, inwardly with the Divine through the practice of meditation and yoga, and then expressed outwardly in our shared activities: vegetarian meals, meditations, service, classes, and recreation.  Students in our residential Cities of Light and Karma Yoga internship programs have a private room with bathrooms just down the hall and three vegetarian meals are served each day. We believe in serving food filled with prana – or life energy. Thus we source organically grown and local ingredients as much as possible.

You can begin your journey in conscious community living by participating in the residential Karma Yoga Internship Program for anywhere from 2 weeks to three months, which integrates spiritual practice, service, personal support, and study of the universal teachings of Self-realization.  Visit our website at http://anandalaurelwood.org/spiritual-internships/ for more information. If at the end of your three-month internship, you’re interested in participating in the long-term Cities of Light residential program, you can apply and interview for acceptance. Costs and fees will be assessed at the time of the interview.  

The long-term Cities of Light residential program is tailored to support those who seek to develop the understanding, the skills and the character that allow for the development of community wherever life might take them.  Some members contribute their time in service to the center while others commute to nearby cities for work. 

On the 175 acres surrounding our campus we are developing an intentional community, what Paramhansa Yogananda called a World Brotherhood Colony, where all of life can be together in one place. We are striving to create a community where the values of simple living and high thinking can be put into practice as an alternative way to live that is more sustainable, and ultimately more fulfilling, where people can find what they truly seek: happiness.</description>

There's art on every wall, instruments everywhere, and spontaneous dance parties in the kitchen. Our pantry yells if you leave it open, there's a three-story firepole right above our chicken coop, and our rooms have bizarre names.

There is no &quot;typical pikan&quot;. We have a wide array of interests and personalities. But if you want a place that is weird and wonderful, that loves roasting vegetables, that's sex positive and queer friendly, independent and thrifty, artsy and nifty, we might be the place for you.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22725&quot;&gt;VillaNueva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The VillaNueva building incorporates sustainability at multiple levels, including material-efficiency (reduced use of land, building materials, energy), pedestrian access (proximity to public transit, healthy food, walkable neighborhoods), social experiences (attention to private spaces, community spaces and connections to the urban fabric), and natural affordability. VillaNueva residents engage the larger community, from neighborhood organizations, to the international dialogue of sustainability and resilience.

We are forming a group of working professionals to create this dynamic transit-oriented community, and develop its mission. VillaNueva is a five-story walkup with offsite parking. Use of alternative transportation modes, like electric cars, walking, transit, biking, scootering, and car sharing are highly encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/villanueva/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/villanueva/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;VillaNueva is a green, urban, naturally affordable, one-bedroom rental community between downtown Salt Lake City and the Salt Lake City International Airport. Scheduled for occupancy Summer 2016, the community will be co-operated by the owner and tenants. Community design is available here: http://cargoarchitecture.ca/en/portfolio_page/villa-nueva/

At over 160 dwellings/acre, the five-story design provides sweeping mountain views, amenity-rich shared patios, and private balconies. The 435-square-foot units are optimized to accommodate one or two young professionals and guests. Units are IKEA-furnished, inspired by cohousing and tiny house design. For example, kitchens are facing common breezeways to encourage social interaction. Ample storage is carefully organized to facilitate tiny house-style living.

Prospective tenants are needed to finalize simple community agreements.

VillaNueva was inspired by its sister property, Spence Garden Community, opened in 2010. Spence is an NAHB Green Emerald, refurbished 8-plex located blocks from Arizona State University and light rail. Sustainability graduate students co-operate the property, and recommend future tenants.</description>

Care for the poor, sustainability, justice, nonviolence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/white-rose-catholic-worker-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/white-rose-catholic-worker-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;WRCW is committed to faith, hospitality to the homeless, education for social justice, peacemaking/nonviolence, sustainability, and gift economy.  Started in 2009 in the Chicagoland area, the WRCW moved to Northeast Missouri in spring of 2014.  We are part of a larger 160 acre community with our immediate neighbors the Possibility Alliance community and Peace &amp;amp; Permaculture Center. All three communities are dedicated to integral nonviolence (meaning to self, others, earth, institutions, etc.) including striving towards electricity &amp;amp; petroleum-free living, gift economy, communal living, simplicity, etc. We live a simple life on the farm (which we very much enjoy!). We have three buildings on the land: a medium-sized workshop that has 4 season housing on one side and storage on the other, a small 4 season one-room cabin, and a small 3 season cabin.  Planning to build more natural buildings to expand our housing options. 

Life on the farm includes home-cooked meals, composting toilets, hosting those in need, growing vegetables, planting trees, continuing permaculture design, candle-making, chopping wood, hosting college groups, and much more!  Off the farm, we are involved in a variety of social justice causes.

There are plenty of additional opportunities on the 160 acres like classes on permaculture, wild edibles, primitive skills, nonviolent communication, canning/preserving vegetables, natural building, etc. Plenty of self entertainment is available on the 160 acres ... community plays, puppet shows, music jams, birthday parties, sports playing, weekly craft nights, etc. The 160 acres hosts over 1000 visitors a year ... so there are plenty of opportunities to meet people from all over the country and the world doing fascinating things.

The nearest town is La Plata, which is 6 miles away and has a public library and an Amtrak station! So it is easy to get to by mass transportation. We have extra bikes available for use. Kirksville is 14 miles away and is a small college town. There is a good article about the WRCW if you search on the internet for “White Rose Catholic Worker Marquette Magazine”.

The Catholic Worker movement is composed of over 200 communities worldwide of many different faiths (not just Catholic) that are committed to nonviolence, voluntary poverty, prayer, hospitality for the homeless, exiled, hungry, and forsaken, and protest of injustice and violence of all forms.  To learn more about the movement, the best book is probably “Loaves &amp;amp; Fishes” by Dorothy Day (co-founder).

Other skills – One of our partners, the Possibility Alliance, is often working on a variety of interesting projects like straw bale house building, goat &amp;amp; cow milking, hand tool repair, bike maintenance, canning,  spoon carving, fermenting foods, horse care, etc.  There could be opportunities to volunteer with some of these projects on occasion.</description>

Five Families. Four units plus a common space (two families share a unit). Quarter-acre lot with lots of fruit trees (hence the name). Solar panels, rain catchment, greywater, urban gardening, etc. Lots of children. 

Some of us go back to college days living together in shared rentals. Did the same for many years in San Francisco. Then in Berkeley. Finally bought a place together in Berkeley where we lived as a co-op house for quite a few years. But the goal had always been full cohousing, so after about a 10-year process, we achieved that in wonderful Oakland, California.</description>

To create an old-fashioned Kansas neighborhood in a new way.

Vision

We feel connected with and responsible for our residential environment.

We share the value and practice of ecologically responsible living.

We respect and give space to the life that members have beyond cohousing.

We are renewed as a cooperative neighborhood through celebration and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/delaware-street-commons-lawrence-ks/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/delaware-street-commons-lawrence-ks/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We began organizing in the fall of 1999. It took us seven years to build the neighborhood. We are an inter-generational neighborhood.  We have edible landscape throughout. We get together in the Common House as a rule on Sunday evenings for dinner. We also have a number of other gatherings planned and more spur of the moment throughout our time together. Compared to many Cohousing Neighborhoods, Delaware Street Commons is affordable. We have a mix of owners/permanent members and members who rent. We have found enrichment from both types.</description>

The Society promotes the non-dual gate of awakening in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/zen-buddhist-temple-ann-arbor/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/zen-buddhist-temple-ann-arbor/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a Zen Buddhist Temple that offers residency opportunities. Residency provides support, structure, stability, and community, which help to deepen one’s understanding and experience of the spiritual in daily life. Our structure seeks to establish a viable and nurturing balance between zen training and one’s obligations outside of residency to family, school, and work. In addition to the daily schedule, residents have access to teachers and are able to receive face-to-face formal teachings, and enjoy frequent informal contacts with them. In addition, the $600/month charge includes room, vegetarian meals, utilities, internet access, laundry facilities, and parking.  We honor diversity.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22731&quot;&gt;Sunburst2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our vision is to create an ecologically sound, self-reliant community, combining the latest technological advances in bio-culture and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sunburst-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sunburst-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Sunburst is a community whose ideology revolves around combining alternative-technology education with holistic living. 

We are an interconnected network of allied small groups of people living communally in New Hampshire, USA.

We provide our essential needs for food, shelter, energy, healing, companionship and self-actualization by sustainable growing practices, by harvesting renewable energy for heat, electricity  and mechanical work, by caring for animals, wild and domestic and by sharing life with each other.

We commune with each other with shared meals, dances, optional spirit practices as well as regular meetings and shared work on the grounds.

We generate value for ourselves, for each other and for our neighbors by selling extra food and plant medicine, education, forest products, alternative energy technology , natural healing and other  business ventures.

Our land {Each site} holds a group of private, personal homes, emphasizing small, energy efficient and simple buildings made from local materials, with centralized community space for dinners, music, dancing, lectures and movies. 

Natural healing is accomplished through  the innate healing abilities of our bodies, assisted by practitioners of chiropractic, massage, meridian therapy, herbalism, reiki, counseling and yoga. For our purification, our community has facilities for bathing, swimming, hot water soaks, sauna and sweat lodges.

Food production is  from foraging, gardening, greenhouse hydroponics, aeroponics, aquaculuture, farming, permaculture and agroforestry.

We intend our community to be an exemplary model of responsible living on planet earth, teaching others our culture, on site and on www.

Visitors are encouraged to come and learn, for a few hours, a few days or a few weeks, with several options for exchange of value.

Some of the interests and skills of current community members are solar and wind power, compost heating, filtered rainwater, natural-style parenting, greenhouse farming, homeschooling, music, and worker-owned cooperative businesses.

The community plans to be self-supporting, providing jobs through intense aquaculture, hydroponics, beekeeping, internet business, recumbent-bicycle making, soap making and perfumes. Sunburst is a home for those who share high ideals and who know that tomorrow is built today. We are presently in the formative stages: We now own 140 acres (50 acres of farmland, 48 acres on a lake Lake Wentworth and 42 acres where we are building our home ), located close to each other . (We are joining another community with 42  acres on which to build our buildings and residential housing). 

We want our members to reside in &quot;tiny homes&quot; , members can bring their own or reside in ours. 

 We are building the relationships and the organizational foundations of a community. We are planning on building a cluster of energy-efficient domes and developing a conference and education center which will demonstrate conservation of energy resources and sustainable agriculture.

This coming spring (17) we are purchasing and constructing two large greenhouses, to house our tomato and vegetable crops.  Also will be building/buying two &quot;storage containers&quot; where we will building a barn out of them. 

 We welcome people who have  &quot;tiny homes and/or small homes on trailers&quot; to join us at our community now. We are in the process of purchasing a community building where we will  have meetings and group  dinners.  The community house will include a pro-type aquaculture system utilizing fish and vegetables. Also we plan to  install a underground thermal storage tank for our compost heating system combined with our solar hot water and rocket stove's.  This spring we will be putting up another greenhouse for our hydroponic gardens.  In addition we will be building a &quot;living pond&quot; and constructing two sheds to house  our rabbits and chickens.

Like-minded persons who are ready to develop and explore themselves in a setting of openness and trust are invited to inquire about Sunburst, either as prospective members or as investors in a socially responsible alternative environment</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22732&quot;&gt;Social Progress Agents Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to support social entrepreneurs in their mission to serve and enhance society and the environment society depends on.  We do this by providing a place where we can live, work, and learn together. We have a library that can help us accomplish our missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/social-progress-agents-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/social-progress-agents-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I have the opportunity to create a community in this place I moved to, a community for social progress agents who want to help improve society and the environment using a cooperative leadership model.
I think an intentional community is much more different than a co-working space. An intentional community offers more benefits than a co-working space too. The other benefit is that you save a lot of money living in a 6 bedroom house with sufficient parking. This place has so much potential to help Social entrepreneurs serve their communities. Being part of community allows you to reduce expenses in many ways including food costs, because we can cook for everyone. I can even bake bread saving $4 dollars per pound of bread. We can also co-own or share cars to reduce expenses on vehicles and insurance. 
 
Benefits of living at the social progress house:
•	Reduce expenses by sharing things or cooperatively owning things like a plug-in hybrid electric car, car insurance, tools, bikes, computers, common area furniture and spaces, farm land, farming tools, food.
•	10-minute driving commute to VCU and downtown.
•	Co-working spaces
•	High-speed Internet WiFi
•	Rent is affordable under $350 - $500 per room and probably cheaper when we find a place we all want to co-own.
•	Be with like-minded people
•	Lots of books. We have a library that will help you develop yourself and your social enterprise aimed to help benefit the world and society.
•	We have plenty of refrigerator space with two extra fridges not being used. 
•	There are places to put your bike and your car.
•	There are around 8 parking spots in the parking area behind the house and off the road.

My name is Danny. I recently purchased a piece of property in Arkansas that is just surrounded by Ozark National Forrest. I have plans to make this an eco village. Starting with 4 recycled travel trailers and building them out to be trendy and completely off grid. I would like this to be the model of sustainable living and would like to see this be hugely successful! Because of the small size, I am mainly interested in folks that can bring an important trade to the community. Let me know what you can bring to the table. Let's get this thing started.

**UPDATE**

Shortly after listing our community on the ic.org website, our core group of members were asked to be a part of a television production.  While this is still up in the air, we feel it is important to inform interested parties that we may have to postpone our opening. Again, this is not a sure thing yet. But the possibly is there that we may be gone for filming, out of the country, for over a year. Though we are disappointed that our community may not open on time, we are excited for the opportunity to shine a positive light on intentional communities, and to share the idea with more folks who may have never known such places existed.

 If you are still interested in becoming a member, please contact me. We may consider letting the right folks occupy the raw land while we are gone. Please note that because we aren't sure of our future direction, as of now, we have not done the prep work to get our infrastructure in place like we had originally planned. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and we hope that you will still consider our community in the future. Please keep checking in. We will update our profile as more information comes available. Thanks again for your interest and understanding as we figure out the details of this new endeavor.

-Personal Growth: Allowing members time for spiritual practice and self-care, and developing skills for conflict resolution.

-Self-Reliance/Earth care: using permaculture and low-tech methods of subsistence.

-Service/Activism: Spreading kindness to fellow human beings through charitable donations, protesting 
harmful activities, political activism, promoting community projects we support, and providing a space for those in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/loving-earth-sanctuary/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/loving-earth-sanctuary/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Located in the Santa Lucia Mountains, and a partner of Still Water's Sanctuary in Missouri, Loving Earth Sanctuary is committed to non-violently resisting the exploitative, consumption-driven systems upon which modern society subsists. We believe that to do this effectively requires us to cultivate personal growth, heal our relationship with the planet, engage in voluntary simplicity, and actively work toward an electricity- and fossil-fuel-free lifestyle, as well as to engage in service to our fellow human beings.  

At this point our group is in the early stages of formation. We have 3 core members, 40 acres equipped with a barn, cabin, and working hand-pump. We are working to expand our small kitchen garden and food forest, and actively seeking anyone interested to volunteer, stay with us, or simply nourish their spirit on the beauty of the hills. 

Our long-term vision is to have a thriving, almost completely self-sufficient system for meeting our basic needs respectfully from the land. In addition, we want to be a source of support for those in need for whom the rural lifestyle would be beneficial too. Possibilities we've discussed include creating spaces for recharge, respite, healing, and mourning. We hope to be an educational center providing learning opportunities freely (without a price attached) the skills necessary for living in a time of ecological uncertainty.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22735&quot;&gt;Nottingham Cooperative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We want to show that cooperative housing is a viable way to live in the modern world.  We just try to all get along and to make things work as best we can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/nottingham-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/nottingham-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Nottingham is one of Madison, Wisconsin's, oldest housing cooperatives.  We are located right on Lake Mendota between the University and the Capitol building.  

Our house, with about 22 private rooms, has hosted a variety of events over the years in the common areas.  We've hosted various parties, plays, musical acts, open mics, and so forth.  

We have two scheduled house meetings per month where we discuss house affairs and responsibilities.  We usually have a house meal together each evening around 6 or 7.  

Members have a wide range of interests but generally lean toward the artistic side.  We also do some gardening and take turns making dinner.  We try to split up house responsibilities as best we can so that no one is burdened too much.  We do have students living here from time to time but we are not strictly a student housing cooperative.</description>

It is at the foot of the Cordillera hills and about 20 minutes to the beach of South China Sea.

Within the community, one can rent for low costs small huts or rooms and avail themselves of free, fresh herbal leaves that include soursop or Anona Muricata Linn, moringa oleifera, guava leaves that treat diabetic wounds, among others!

One can also forage for available seasonal and organic fruits like mango, cashew &amp; nuts, lomboy or Syzygium cumini, and many more!

The farm community owner, Ernesto Tadeja is himself kept healthy even if he is diabetic, once tuberculosis-afflicted (due to chain smoking) with these foods and activities.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22737&quot;&gt;Solidarity Collective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are an anti-capitalist and anti-oppression commune, with a strong dedication to personal growth and ecologically sound systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/laramie-ecovillage-project/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/laramie-ecovillage-project/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a recently landed community still transitioning into the fullness of our systems. We occupy 3 acres of formerly indigenous land, apartments that are converted 1930's motel rooms moved from Laramie, and an 1878 mansion that was also moved from downtown Laramie and has a storied history in the local memory. Our immediate neighbors are cows and antelope. It is dry, windy and gorgeous here.

We operate using consensus, practice strong and matter-of-fact conflict resolution, and are moving toward income-sharing. We require that everyone in the group have a personal growth or spiritual practice that is effective at helping them grow and navigate group dynamics. While we are *not* a UU community, we took early inspiration from the Unitarian Universalist principles (adapted slightly here): 

We affirm and promote:

    ~ The Inherent worth and dignity of every person;
    ~ Justice, equity and compassion in human relations;
    ~ Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth;
    ~ A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;
    ~ The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our community and in society at large;
    ~ The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;
    ~ Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.
    ~ The 8th principle (under consideration): speaks to our responsibility to practice anti-oppression and particularly anti-racism.

We have chickens, will be breaking ground on gardens in the spring of 2019, and hope to have a greenhouse by then as well (because, ya know, it's hard to grow food around here without that). It is our intention to be as sustainable as possible, and we are dialoguing about the level of self-sufficiency we will pursue. We share meals, rides, a library, meeting and project spaces and game times. As an income sharing group we expect to share cars, facilities and other resources extensively.

Our target population is between 20 and 35 adults. About half of our core group  have lived in community previously, and we range in age from mid-twenties to 50. Laramie is a college town of 31,000 at 7,200 feet of elevation. It is a liberal hub within a very red state. We are, in turn, an unapologetically lefty bubble in the midst of liberalness, with members who identify as socialists, anarchists and a variety of other politics.</description>

Our belief is a very simple one. We try to follow the teaching of Jesus Christ. He tells us about the righteousness in His Kingdom, which is not of this world (system) and this is what we desire. In all that we are doing, in all how we are acting, we try to stay righteous. May it be the work on the land or with the animals, righteousness is our benchmark. We are a simple family, live a plain but comfortable life. In order to maintain our expenses like fuel, taxes and so on, we sell part of our crops or products to others, who value pure food.

Farming can be simple, if one considers all aspects of life. However, simple does not mean easy living. In fact, working the soil is hard work, but still it's part of life.
We believe this part of the earth was created in perfection and destroyed only within a few decades due to inconsiderate farming methods.</description>

-- have regular shared meals and other opportunities to gather socially,
-- support each other in our personal and shared endeavors,
-- agree to resolve conflicts peaceably with each other,
-- make decisions together effectively, efficiently, and democratically,

      <name>Community for Mindful Living - Berkeley and Bolinas, CA (San Francisco Bay Area)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22743&quot;&gt;Community for Mindful Living - Berkeley and Bolinas, CA (San Francisco Bay Area)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Who are we?

We are a community of people who feel modern society is going a bit too fast.  While we accept it and live within the modern world, we also try to live in a slower, simpler, and more balanced way.

We’ve created this website to lay out a vision for living in community and connect with other people who are interested in joining and molding our efforts.  We are families, couples, and individuals committed to cultivating a practice of simple, healthy living within a modern community that we collectively create.  It would most likely follow the model of a cohousing/ecovillage community (private units with shared common house, gardens, etc.), but with a deep commitment to being a place of personal and collective transformation, for both residents and visitors.

For those of you familiar with the Plum Village tradition, one of the community models we admire, one could think of our efforts as a desire to create a year-round lay person Plum Village environment for us all – though not “religious” or tied to any single religious tradition.

We feel the dominant cultural focus on the “individual” and “independence” has gone too far and we’re beginning to lose our innate understanding of how all things are interconnected.  We choose to intentionally live in and build “community” – so that we can learn to be more “interdependent” and to better maintain healthy relationships with ourselves and others.

We consider living in a supportive community a valuable opportunity for both personal and societal transformation.  The benefits for our children, ourselves, our neighbors, and our planet are innumerable.

Are we a Meditation Community?  

Meditation is a practice for many, though not all, of us.  However becoming more present and insightful by cultivating mindful awareness of the present moment is something we all aspire to.

What is Mindfulness?

“Mindfulness is a state of active, open attention on the present. When you’re mindful, you observe your thoughts and feelings from a distance, without judging them good or bad. Instead of letting your life pass you by, mindfulness means living in the moment and awakening to experience.” Psychology Today

Are we a Spiritual Community?

We believe building and living in community are in fact spiritual practices. We’re not affiliated with any specific religion, and most of us don’t consider ourselves to be “religious.”   However, we do embrace various contemplative practices found in all religions, and many of us rely heavily on various Buddhist traditions, though we believe most of our mindfuless practices are common to all wisdom traditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/community-for-mindful-living-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/community-for-mindful-living-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We're committed to cultivating a practice of family-friendly mindful living within a modern cohousing community.  Residents own their living spaces and a shared interest in a large common house, gardens, and other communal spaces.

We consider living in a supportive community a valuable opportunity for both personal and societal transformation.  The benefits for our children, ourselves, our neighbors, and our planet are innumerable.

We are involved in three active initiatives.

1. Bolinas/Stinson Beach, CA  Project.  This is our BIG NEWS.  We are in very early stages, but seriously looking at creating an intentional community on agricultural land in this beautiful seaside community, 50 minutes from San Francisco.  If you have in interest in joining us, please let us know.

2. Berkeley, CA Project.  In 2011, we converted a well located 4 unit Berkeley, CA property into a small cohousing community with 8 adults and 5 children.  Currently, there are no openings, though we eventually hope to acquire the two adjacent properties, ultimately growing to 10-12 units.  Contact us to be alerted when openings become available.

3. Madrid Project.  We have a small 5 unit cohousing prototype project up and running in Madrid, Spain with a high level or intentional living and mindfulness practices at our core.  It is full at the moment but we regularly welcome guests from all over the world.

We Are United By:

1) A Shared Insight that all things are interconnected.  We inter-are.

 2) A Shared Practice of mindfulness and living in the present moment as a way of cultivating insight and wisdom.

The community’s success is measured by its effectiveness in supporting the growth and happiness of those it influences.

We Embrace Two Primary Values

1) Communitarian – Living in harmony with others.  We share the strong intention to live more collaboratively and closely with others in order to better understand ourselves and the world we live in.  We see living in true community among supportive friends as an opportunity for, both personal and societal transformation.

2) Educational – Spreading knowledge and inspiring others.  We find purpose in what we do by educating and empowering others beyond our core community.  We endeavor to model an attractive, healthy, joyful, sustainable way of living in a compassionate, cooperative and less consumptive manner.

Other Values Follow

1) Simplicity – Living simple lives in the present moment. We are living in fast-paced, distracting, chaotic times.  It is increasingly easy, and hazardous, to lose our bearings in the modern world.  We aspire to live simply, and slowly, in a supportive community that helps us stay focused on what matters most.

2) Ecological – Living in harmony with nature.  We strive to live more sustainably by embracing permaculture principles.  We pursue renewable energy, green building methods, the reduction of waste, compassionate consumption, and other methods of treading lightly on our planet.

3) Inclusion – We value and embrace inclusion.  We are non-sectarian and deeply respect the many different cultural and lifestyle traditions.  Our common thread is our commitment to cultivating an awareness of the divine in all things.  We are open to everyone who shares this respect and see strength in diversity.  

Characteristics of our Community Include

1) Participatory process. Residents participate in the design and management of the community, help prepare common meals, and together solve problems and develop policies for the community.

2) Common facilities. Common facilities and open spaces are designed for optional daily use, are an integral part of the community, and are supplemental to the individual residences.

3) Non-hierarchical structure and decision-making.  No one person (or persons) has authority over others, though we value expertise and seniority.  As people join the group, each person takes on one or more roles consistent with his or her skills, abilities or interests. We use a form of modified consensus for all decision-making.

4) No shared community economy.  Currently, the community is not a source of income for its members and typically work done by anyone will be considered that member’s contribution to the shared responsibilities.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22744&quot;&gt;WILA Farms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are all about the farm. We are all about the garden (about an acre).  We have tons of food available usually and like to eat it.  People on the farm will be expected to cook, wash dishes, weed that garden, (there will be others to help) and watch animals when we are gone (usually in the Fall, but camping trips sometimes in the Summer). We are   openminded.  We do not care what your sexual orientation is, what your beliefs are, our round table discussions can be mind-bending, so come prepared for anything to be discussed. We believe in Sustainability and the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/wila-farms/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/wila-farms/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We live off grid, grow 90% of our food, raise goats, chickens and go fishing.  We are well established in the community.  No drugs, alcohol, or smoking allowed.  There is a cabin available.  Heat with wood. People applying must love animals and gardening.   Work available just down the road with resorts and restaurant. Shared food at meals in the beginning (year). One hour a day of  work in exchange for lodging and food for watching farm while we are away and weeding in garden.  Share of all the garden produce will go to everyone on the farm.   There will be entire parts of the winter you will not have to do much work.  Mostly work is expected in Spring through late Fall.  So there might be two hours of work occasionally.  We are meat eaters, we treat our animals very well and expect that they are treated well and respected for what they give us. We love the woods and are surrounded by about a million square areas of it.  The BWCA just sits north of us. Wilderness abounds.  About 1/2 mile back from Lake Vermilion. You will be encouraged to raise your own garden.</description>

The focus also is on establishing ways of self-supply (bio garden, chicken, fruit farming).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/familia-feliz-ger1/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/familia-feliz-ger1/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Familia Feliz is a decentralized living community with shared economy. Decentralized means those people live together who want to do so. The community does not dictate where a member should live or that all members have to live in one place at all times. Instead, it is part of the concept of Familia Feliz to live in different countries and different places. We start in Spain and Germany as these are the countries we already live and call our homes. Our community life is based on a shared economy, decisions by consensus, veto for each and solidarity with each member.  We respect and develop private property and focus on life in peace and freedom.

Familia Feliz is organized in units. A unit can be a working unit like &quot;bio garden&quot; or a company run by members, as well as a a home unit, a group of members living in one house.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22746&quot;&gt;Casa Colibri Catholic Worker A.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are a community that advances the integral development of the families of Hostotipaquillo, Jal, who are in vulnerable situations, by accompanying them in processes to improve their conditions of life by means of their active participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/casa-colibri-catholic-worker-a-c/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/casa-colibri-catholic-worker-a-c/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Casa Colibri is part of the Catholic Worker movement started by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin. If you are unfamiliar with it, check out the national website to become familiar with the philosophy: 

www.catholicworker.org/communities/directory.html

At Casa Colibri there are five areas that enrich the community experience:

Children:
Monday, Wednesday and Friday we have 40 kids, ranging from 4-17 years old. First there is an hour of class, and then we serve them a homemade meal. These days the work consists of preparing and cooking the food, teaching or playing with the kids, serving the food, and cleaning the house. 

Sustainability:
Tuesdays and Thursdays consist of a variety of activities around the house, especially working in the garden where we have chickens, compost worms, medicinal herbs, and vegetables. Extra activities include the soap project in which the kids learn how to make soaps from herbs grown in our garden. 

Community Life:
This is a big part of living at Casa Colibri. The house also has many other activities that we do within the community, such as group check-ins, meditations, and excursions to the pueblo and surrounding areas. Every Friday we have a “happy hour” in which we do something fun as a community. 

Community development:
We also work with the community of Hostotipaquillo by giving extra classes and workshops (depending on the number of volunteers and their skills) involving the families of the children as well. We also work to create a culture of art and creativity in the house and with the greater community of Hostotipaquillo.

Spirituality:
This includes a monthly Mass, when friends and the families come to the house to gather, as well as weekly group meditations and discussions. The house is open to people of all spiritualities. 

The day starts with breakfast at 7:30 am, and on average we work about 6-7 hours, including the mid-day meal. The evening time, after 5:00 pm is personal time. Saturday and Sundays are free, with the exception of the monthly community Mass or special events.

Previous experience working with children, farming, and/or living in community is a plus. However these skills are not required, as long as you are open to learning, experiencing new things, and being challenged. Knowledge of basic Spanish is required.

The house asks that you make a minimum 6-month commitment.

In exchange for working with an open and generous heart, one will receive room and board. Extra personal expenses should be covered by the community member.
In addition to community members we also have national and international short term volunteers.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22748&quot;&gt;Uruguay World Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our hope is to build a world community of people looking to settle somewhere beautiful, safe, and easy to emigrate to. We are flexible and open to all kinds of arrangements. As of right now, we would only lease the land to people we have come to know and trust. If you are interested in emigrating to Uruguay, get in touch with us and come and meet us. If we build a relationship and mutually agree that sharing the land would be a good option, we can then talk about legal options for living on the land. However, we expect this relationship-building stage to take some time, so do not expect to meet us online and immediately come move to the land. Alternatively, we would love for people to settle nearby to us on their own land, so we can share resources and build a community together. We are a family with young children, but would love to develop a community that represents all ages.

We imagine a little village. One where we have our own individual homes and lifestyles, but can live in community with one another. Get in touch if you share this dream!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/uruguay-world-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/uruguay-world-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a family originally from Chicago that has chosen Uruguay as the place we will settle and raise our kids. Patrick (b. 1985) and Ashley (b. 1985) and Isabel (b. 2013) have 9 acres in the beautiful Uruguayan countryside in between Nueva Helvecia and Playa Fomento. Our land is 2 hours (by bus and ferry) to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and 1.5 hours (by bus) to Montevideo, Uruguay. Our land is fertile, our water clean, and we are looking for people with whom we can share our abundance! Whether that means to share in living on the land, in agricultural production, sharing tools or animals, sharing in schooling children, or coming together to share knowledge and have fun, we would love others to come to come live nearby!</description>

Each of us has potential. The world around us has hidden that potential in a sea of concrete and broken dreams.

A. Close this listing and think this is some strange stuff and return to your normal life.
B. To follow the white rabbit down the hole on a journey of realization you will not be able to return from.
Your dreams are outside of your reach. Happiness and Peace has eluded you.
Like sheep herded by fate.
Embrace your destiny, Releasing the caged animal inside.
Community, Study, Honor, Fitness

Break free from the world which binds you.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22755&quot;&gt;Aponi Gardens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The goal is to establish a completely self-sufficient community through permaculture, community enterprises, subsistence farming, agroforesty and ecotourism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/aponi-gardens/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/aponi-gardens/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I am looking for co-founders, investors, and business partners to establish non-profit corporations and my first eco-village/eco-resort.  So I need people that are willing to invest time, resources and/or work as hard as I have to establish these visions and dreams.  There is no municipal water at the property at present so it is not suitable for children under 18.  If someone wanted to help me establish the infrastructure to increase the water treatment facilities and construct private restrooms then that would be different.

Aponi Gardens is over twelve acres of land in the greater Big Thicket region of Southeast Texas.  The main property is in Tyler  County, along the northern gateway to the Big Thicket and the smaller recreational lot is in Montgomery County in an area known as the Little Thicket.  The goal is to establish a completely self-sufficient community through permaculture, community enterprises, agroforesty and ecotourism.  I have a unique vision and brand of ecotourism and farming that I would like to establish here and replicate elsewhere.  I am currently seeking co founders and partners.  We have open places for offgrid RV's, yurts, tents and tiny homes.  Also there is plenty of room to build your own wigwam, teepee or longhouse.    



  One week RV camping is $400 and you will be the only other party on the 12 acre property.  Tent camping for one week is $100, but other guest may be present.  If you want to be the only other party the fee is the same as for an RV.  RV and tent camping for one month is $640 as the sole party camping on the grounds.  For one month's tent camping with the possibility of other guest the fee is $460.



Some of the main types of construction that I am interested in are log building and ferrocement construction.

At present the only connection to the grid is electricity.  Electricity is available at the front of the recreational lot.

The Tyler County property is an amazing biologically diverse property with ideal topography for retention ponds.  I presently have nearly everything we need to build a log cabin.  During the dead of winter is the time to cut the trees traditionally.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22757&quot;&gt;Jourdan Valley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to develop a residential housing alternative designed to maximize interaction between neighbors. We believe that building smaller homes around an extensive, shared common space will foster an affordable, sustainable, and engaging community experience. We are seeking community members who want to live in a diverse, multi-generational environment with strong community support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/jourdan-valley/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/jourdan-valley/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our society focuses on traditional nuclear family homes, but for us, this format no longer meets our needs. We live in neighborhoods, in communities, but still many people don't know their neighbors and feel isolated and alone.  
​
We have a simple mission: to create an affordable, residential community with efficient private homes and generous common space structured to engage its members and create daily, casual interaction and shared experiences.  Tucked between Claiborne and St. Claude along the Industrial Canal, this area within the Lower Ninth Ward is well-suited for a pocket community. 

The Lower Ninth Ward has a history of strong community roots. We are inspired by the legacy of neighborhood participation and want to resurrect the high-functioning neighborhood traditional to this area to serve the mental, emotional, and physical health of the community. We feel that isolation in a community can be detrimental to its people, and our aim is to rebuild the neighborhood fabric that offers activities, shared amenities, and friendly environment to elevate the benefits to all of our neighbors. We hope that our development leads to other development in the area.  While the community still has limited access to groceries, schools, and health care we hope to be an impetus for additional, positive investment.</description>

The look of our village will be clean, green, modern, quality and organised. There will be a good mix of public and private space.

Demonstration
Our village and our processes will be a showcase and teaching ground for interested visitors. We will endeavour to inspire others to live more lightly on the earth and show that it is possible without compromising a comfortable, mainstream lifestyle.

Village
We aim to build a thriving, diverse community of 300+ people of all ages. The layout will encourage neighbourly interaction while respecting people’s privacy – we will have a strong sense of belonging.

Some people with homes in our village may work from home or in the village or work part-time in the city.

Narara
Our village is located at Narara, a little over an hour north of Sydney and 20 minutes from the coast. We aim to build positive and inclusive relationships with our neighbours, other parts of Australia and the World.

Eco-sustainability
We will live in harmony with nature, preserving natural habitats on village land and build a home with minimal environmental impact which considers orientation, thermal mass, planting for privacy and temperature control, insulation, energy efficiency and environmentally friendly materials, as well as eco-friendly water supply, power, drainage, garbage disposal and recycling.

Good health
Our village aims to actively promote physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing. We will pursue activities and facilities to develop good health. These will develop and change over time, and include both residents and guests.

Business
We aim to develop a business centre to encourage and nurture enterprises set up in our village – so that people can live, work and play here.

Caring
We plan is to establish a system of caring so that you will know what will happen in the event of a dramatic life change, e.g. your partner should die, you become dependently sick, you have an accident, you need permanent care or you need temporary assistance. We aim to develop a system of caring that will be agreed upon, documented and implemented.

Other options that may evolve
We will set up flexible systems to oversee the necessary changes to our evolving village and to encourage ongoing, fresh initiative and enterprise. We will support a diversity of activities, new thoughts and perspectives to keep the energy of the village alive.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22762&quot;&gt;Araminta Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Co-creating a ferociously powerful, non-violent, authentically democratic, residential community and community model that honors our differences of race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity and expression, ability, sexual orientation, age, class, religion… our common humanity, and our planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/araminta-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/araminta-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This community is growing out of the work of The Sum (www.thesum.org). We  envision both a Study Center and a an intertwined community where people can have an opportunity, in an environment of open-hearted dialogue, to be enriched by our differences and our commonality. This is a place where we can cultivate our unique genius and empowerment while being challenged to do our own, sometimes hard, personal work around the places we have privilege and the places we do not. We feel joyfully challenged to grow a garden on this planet where all people may find and experience &quot;home&quot; - where all aspects of our identities are seen and welcomed. We are creating a model for this kind of a community that will engender and share our human understanding of how this might be accomplished in the larger world. As a part of this, we experience a solidarity with the voiceless - including the environment - and seek to consider how best to withdraw our participation from violent and oppressive systems and engage with the development of meaningful alternatives.
We are seeking emotionally stable/mature core members who are willing to own their personal work as the deep soil preparation needed to grow a garden of empowered, ingenious people, healthy food, joyful connection, and social justice. Araminata Farm will provide the support and context for the work of The Sum (www.thesum.org). Our vision is that people will come from far away to Araminta as a place to study and learn. Some will stay and be a part of a life-long diverse community. Most will study and take their learning on their paths.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22764&quot;&gt;Windhorse IMH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Non-profit organization that provides services and education with a whole-person approach to recovery from serious psychiatric distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/windhorse-imh/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/windhorse-imh/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Windhorse approach was created to address a number of issues commonly experienced in conventional mental health models.

The desire to become autonomous and re-enter the community can become shaky after long periods of separation from what becomes “the outside world.” The Windhorse approach was created to interrupt or prevent these patterns of recidivism by keeping people integrated within the larger community and surrounding them with a team that accompanies them through ordinary, daily activities, while modeling compassion and mindfulness. We begin our work with clients by creating a healing environment with the team members and a therapeutic housemate in the home.

Our team approach allows for “all voices heard” which builds a sense of belonging and empowered inclusion. We also practice mutual recovery, during which the client and team members share personal experiences and learn from each other through the clinicians’ skillful approach to conversations, activities, and life.

During the program, clients start to seek more engagement in the world. Changes are introduced when a sense of self and self-worth starts to emerge. Patience, tolerance for uncertainty, and belief in the client’s ability to recover are crucial to sustainable change.

We are proud of our active and growing Windhorse Communities. Alumni often stay in touch with their teams, staff, and peers. They keep us apprised of work they have found, projects they are collaborating on, an interaction with a loved one that would have seemed impossible the year before, and much more. Families also continue coming to our support groups to share and receive helpful stories and guidance.

Since we started Windhorse Integrative Mental Health (WIMH) in 1993, we have gained wisdom, insight, and best practices from experiential learning and from each other. We have also become skilled at incorporating best practices that complement our approach.</description>

We are committed to living simply on a smaller footprint allowing time and resources for the pursuit of creative endeavors.

Our values are cooperation, tolerance, trust, and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/silver-leaf/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/silver-leaf/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Silver Leaf, an elder cohousing project, consists of a group of artistic, caring, and creative individuals committed to living cooperatively and harmoniously with our neighbors, the land, the environment, and the community at large.

But my husband and I are serious about wanting to live in community on the outskirts of Bend, Oregon. 

We have a young daughter and are primarily  looking for a few other small families to join us in living simply, sharing a lot of space, life and labor. Beyond that we would also love to have a variety of ages involved.

Our ideal setup is small personal spaces and a large common house for most of our needs beyond privacy- cooking, playing, creating...this allows for comfortably working together on life chores and allows more time and resources for extracurriculars. Also, there can be frequent human connection and assistance without the scheduling and driving that modern life entails.

Join us! Let's build a community!</description>

      <name>The Frum Farm - Shaare Shamayim</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22770&quot;&gt;The Frum Farm - Shaare Shamayim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; VISION &amp; VALUES OF SHAARE SHAMAYIM FRUM FARM
 
OUR VISION:
 
To create and live in a rural farm community of Orthodox Jews, that, in spite of our varied backgrounds, fosters harmony with each other, the community at large; and to be good stewards of the land, as we actively live out our Torah values.
 
OUR VALUES:
 
Hashem &amp; Torah first
We strive to be Torah-true, living a life of Kiddush Hashem, to produce a tangible example of the beauty of Torah living.
 
Stewardship &amp; Responsibility
We live gently on the Earth. We are thankful for Hashem's resources He has blessed us with, so we are conscious to take good care of them and use them efficiently. We take personal responsibility to be good stewards with all that we are blessed with. We will preserve the rural agricultural environment and appearance, maintaining open “no build” spaces, and creating a permaculture that is eco-friendly to the rural natural habitat.
 
Cooperation, Honesty &amp; Integrity
Through honesty, understanding, generosity, compassion and integrity, we live cooperatively with one another. When appropriate, we place the interests of the community ahead of our own self-interests, while also valuing our own self-worth.
We recognize our interdependence with all life, and its source. To all that came before us, we offer our respect and remembrance. To all with whom we share this world, we seek mutual understanding and respect. To all who will come after us, we strive to leave a better world. Most of all, we strive to honor Hashem in all that we do.
 
Commitment, Education &amp; Participation
Though we know that the path may be difficult at times, we are committed to our Vision for the long haul.
We seek the exchange of knowledge, skills, and resources with each other and the larger community. We seek to pass this education on to our children, while providing them with a quality education, both secular and religious.
Knowing that our community is fueled by the energy we give it, we all actively participate in community life and work. Each of us gives of his or her energy and skills according to the ability of each.
 
Respect, Kindness &amp; Support
Our farm community supports friendship and an “extended family” environment, thereby creating a sense of belonging for all. We support the growth of each other individually and the relationships amongst us. Each of us is willing to work on our own personal growth so that we can improve those relationships.
We also respect personal privacy and each individual’s choice as to their level of interconnectedness with other community members.
We respect the freedom of each person to live as he/she chooses, so long as that does not interfere with others in the community or run contrary to our stated core Vision and Values.
We value every member, including children, and treat them with kindness and respect.
 
Safety &amp; Balance
In our community, we strive to create an environment of safety - emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually – where all feel welcomed, safe and at home.
Each of us individually, as well as all of us as a community, takes responsibility for our actions, considering how our actions may affect others.
We maintain balance in our community: between Shabbat and the everyday; between group and individual; between building for tomorrow and enjoyment of today; between working hard and having fun; etc., all while seeking to elevate the mundane to holier heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-frum-farm-shaare-shamayim/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-frum-farm-shaare-shamayim/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are the &quot;Alternadox&quot; ;-) seeking to build an Othodox Jewish, but alternative-to-the-city, true, rural community, off-the-grid, with our own sources of power, water and kosher food supply.
A planned community, an “eco-village”, is to be built,  with green state-of-the-art engineering, and including an organic aquaponic greenhouse, with unique, inventive characteristics.  The community will exclusively use alternative power supplies (solar, wind), and will be a co-operative community.
It will include on-site educational facilities, with active outreach toward assisting others in building their own similar projects.
The community will be dedicated to kiruv, warmly welcoming Jews from all backgrounds, be they FFB, balei tshuva or convert; as well as being a safe place for women breaking free of situations of domestic violence. The community will be a place of peace, comfort, happiness and education, where a Jew is a Jew, treated with respect, as they learn to be community builders, and continue on to help others.
We are not seeking to build a commune or a kibbutz, but our vision is more that of an old-fashioned farming community (yet with new-fashioned technology!), where each family has their own home and open space, but where community members help each other and participate as a co-op, for the benefit of all...  a place where we can reap the benefits of a community, but have the freedom of the open country; and where we can truly live by the commandments with joy!</description>

      <name>Shiloh Springs EcoVillage</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22771&quot;&gt;Shiloh Springs EcoVillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Shiloh Springs EcoVillage seeks to exist as an offering of hope to the world and faith in our Creator that there are better ways to live and work with one another and the Earth than are now commonly practiced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/shiloh-springs-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/shiloh-springs-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Here at Shiloh Springs Ecovillage (Shiloh Springs), our primary goal is focused on quality of life, character development, and spiritual growth within the foundational principles of Messianic Judeo Christian faith with traditional Biblical ethics. We also have some beliefs in Mormonism, however we have no ties to any organized external churches. To that end, we stand apart as an anatomist community, and with that said, we are looking for a core group of initial founders to set the standard of common unity of faith in the Savior of the World, Yeshua, Ha Mashiach. 

We have many goals toward sustainability, on-site electrical power generation, renewable clean-burning fuels, power economy, and eventually power independence, more sustainable agriculture, more effective heating systems and technology, more earth-friendly recycling and waste disposal systems. These things take time, work, and collective minds and energy to bring to fruition. It takes people with sincere desire and strong work ethic to courageously try new things, refine old but proven practices, and to develop and implement new ideas. We believe it takes the synergy of a community of willing people who can think outside of the box and work in this living experiment in social evolution to help find better ways, hopefully becoming a part in a this new human renaissance. We also embrace the wisdom that there is some degree of security in knowing how to live and survive outside of far-removed infrastructures and unstable economies. This kind of sustainability is also the goal of Shiloh Springs EcoVillage. 

At Shiloh Springs we understand that personal and spiritual paths are very individual matters yet we are all part of one another’s paths and experiences. People who gather here should believe that personal and spiritual growth and development are deeply important to every individual. For it is not enough to feed the body, we must also feed the mind and the soul. It is the goal of Shiloh Springs EcoVillage that we encourage each other in this growth. Only in this way can we ever come to understand how to live and work peacefully and effectively with one another, how to solve problems and resolve conflict, and how to become that change we wish to see happen in this world. Therefore we will meet together for practical purposes such as work projects, conflict resolution, and EcoVillage planning and business, for these things are necessary. But we also will encourage the planning of recreation, fellowship, charitable projects, celebrations, and social activities. After all, we are neighbors and brothers/sisters of the Messiah's Gospel. Love and trust come of both working and playing together.

What we cannot offer at Shiloh Springs EcoVillage is a place to hide, from your brethren, yourself, or from the world. If you have criminal problems or a criminal record, social problems such as hostility, violence, addiction, or sexual predation or deviances from Biblical standards, these are not problems that can be resolved nor can they be condoned here. Shiloh Springs EcoVillage has a process for the consideration and admittance, as well as the removal or resignation of members and residents. When considering someone for membership, Shiloh Springs will require a completed written questionnaire we provide and a criminal/sex offender background check for the sake of the security and peace of mind of the entire community. As one of our primary industries is the growth and preparation of food for sale at the local Farmers Markets, member must be able to obtain a Food Handlers License. Having an infectious and or contagious disease many disqualify you from being able to join or live in the community. 

In 2007, after years and years of searching and praying regarding buying land, be were directed to this place here in Colorado. We purchased 70 acres in the county of Montrose, at the edge of the unincorporated town of Redvale. The land at Shiloh Springs EcoVillage is located on the rim of the canyon of Naturita Creek, which crosses the edge of the property some 500 hundred feet below. We are currently in the middle of construction of the community irrigation system. The plans for a micro-hydro plant are currently in development. We would like to build a common house for community gathering and to house facilities that would assist residents and be temporary housing for persons (such as student interns), with laundry and bathroom facilities. We also are looking to eventually integrate aquaponics into the greenhouses, and get a working permiculture-based system going regarding the gardens. This year we have introduction bee hives, vermi-culture (worm farming), and hops to the community. 

The land does hold a mortgage. It is not the intention of Shiloh Springs EcoVillage to give private ownership deeds to entering members or to break up the ownership of the land, but we do intend to place the land into a situation such as a trust, down the road when the mortgage has been satisfied. 

Shiloh Springs EcoVillage will offer short-term and, after a provisional period and member consideration, longer-term lot leases to residents. All members are required to work for the Farm Co-op, as a condition to retaining a lease to live within the community. Our desires are to have an ever-increasing emphasis on internal economy, through non-monetary forms of exchange such as barter, reduced or exchanged housing costs when possible, or paper-accounted trades between stewardships. Starting our own thrift store, herb shop, dry goods hardware, community cow and garden, and other home-craft enterprise is foundational to our success and will be highly encouraged.  

Our intention at Shiloh Springs EcoVillage is to move toward living off the grid, on renewable energy sources, producing fewer greenhouse gases, and living environmentally friendly in more unity with the land. We will seek to build using alternative techniques such as straw bale, hemp concrete bermed earth structures, attached south facing greenhouses, passive radiant heating systems, and passive cooling systems when possible. We encourage the development of additional types of cohousing and cooperatives within the community. We would also like to encourage implementing the use of vehicles owned jointly by the community itself, eventually ones electric powered, or ethanol and bio-diesel powered. We are dedicated to developing the ability of growing most of the foods we consume ourselves or to barter for them first, before outside food is purchased.

We strive to be good stewards of our land, with much of our acreage reserved for limited agriculture, with vineyards and orchards, the pastures and common garden spot. In the river bottoms we will attempt to reintroduce native blackberry plants and medicinal herbs to help revitalize our region's bio-diversity, as well as add to our pasture land. Additionally, we have cut out lots of the dead juniper and winter-kill from our forest and would like to consider the planting of a food forest among the trees. We wish to restock the fish pond on the land as another sustainable community food source. 

Outreach and education is an integral part of our mission, rather than isolating ourselves completely from the mainstream society or others with similar beliefs, we promote Shiloh Springs EcoVillage as a viable alternative to the disconnected rat race that popular society has embraced. Shiloh Springs EcoVillage will have an Altruistic Society for community charitable and outreach projects such as a Gleening Society, local Food Bank projects, and participating in other similar activities. We encourage all members to volunteer their time as they can as these opportunities in brotherhood, service, and good will arise. We enjoy sharing all that G_d has so mercifully and amply blessed us with, with willing hands and hearts. 

If you are interested in Shiloh Springs, please email us and arrange to visit. We also have conditional memberships available for those who would like to come and live with us on a temporary basis, to see if this lifestyle is for them. And though we are not actively seeking new members to share our Community with, we are looking for those core members to actually establish our community with. We acknowledge that this path is not for everyone, our paths may take many twists and turns, and not everyone is destined to put in the effort needed to live this particular lifestyle, but for those drawn to such a lifestyle, please reach out and lets visit.</description>

MISSION STATEMENT - A community holding sacred space, inviting people to experience the spiritual nature of life through action, reflection, and celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/arc-retreat-community-an-ecumenical-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/arc-retreat-community-an-ecumenical-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;ARC (action, reflection, celebration) is an inter-spiritual retreat center operated by a resident intentional community serving individuals and groups seeking time apart, rest and spiritual renewal. ARC is nestled on 90 acres of pristine wetlands and majestic white pine forest an hour north of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. 

ARC's intentional community members offer radical hospitality and hold the sacred space for guests to reflect, renew and heal. Nourish your mind, body and soul with community connections, homemade vegetarian meals and deep conversations with guests. We work hard and join together for the common purpose of serving guests and growing spiritually on our individual paths. 

ARC has a 40 year old log lodge where community members and guests stay in separate wings of the building. We also have a hermitage and a log cottage for guests. Community members are welcome to use the spaces when they are unoccupied. 

The four to nine persons living in intentional community commit to a practice of daily silent meditation, community relationships, personal growth work and managing all elements of the retreat center, as the primary way of living; all community members are volunteers, receive room and board, and a monthly stipend. Our food is cooked from scratch and primarily vegetarian.</description>

      <name>New Culture DC</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22774&quot;&gt;New Culture DC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; communication, community building, personal growth, social change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/new-culture-dc/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/new-culture-dc/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;New Culture DC is a non-land-based intentional community of over a hundred people in the DC/Baltimore region. Our members are those who have experienced New Culture at an event, gathering, workshop, or at an intentional community based on New Culture, and choose to become part of our intense and intimate network.

NCDC sees community as a means to social change, and one of our goals is to encourage our members to live in ways which serve as models of healthy ways of relating to the Earth and to each other. We see our community as a means to produce a world without fear, violence, coercion, or sexual repression. We believe that there are several key components to realizing this vision: self-responsible individuals; mutual support, honesty and openness in interpersonal relationships, a realization that means determine ends, and a realization that the personal is political — that is, a commitment to personal growth and change.

We are the DC New Culture group.  There are also local New Culture groups in Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, North Carolina, West Virginia, and Massachusetts; and there are intentional communities based on NFNC principles in Virginia, West Virginia, Washington State, California, Hawaii, and Oregon. To facilitate the community-forming and personal growth process, and to enrich our connections with each other, we hold conferences, workshops, and camps throughout the year, as well as many informal gatherings.  Often, New Culture people will become housemates, forming a kind of mini-intentional community.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22777&quot;&gt;TaraEden EcoVillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To create a community that works for all, while protecting and prospering our planet, being a shining example for the world to teach/ duplicate this sustainable lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/taraeden-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/taraeden-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hello, everyone!! 
So happy to finally get a public posting of our dream community!
First off, let me introduce myself, I AM Niki Lane, Director and Visionary behind this huge endeavor.
Yes, I believe I have lost my mind while at the same time being more sane than i have ever been!  LOL. In the words of MLK, I HAVE A DREAM! And I intend with everything i am to get this ball rolling; someway, somehow it WILL happen!  We are in what I would call the zygote state; we are not even in the embryonic state yet! In fact, It is kinda like the morning after conception! 
So if you are looking for a place that is up and running, a &quot;turn key&quot; step into perfection kind of situation well this is not it, keep moving. This is dirty, messy and so ground floor as to be almost subterranean! 
 We are seeking the most intrepid, energetic and gregarious type of individuals to come be founding pioneer FAMILY members. We need souls that desire to have an intricately involved commitment to a project, who have visions of a more perfect world and who desire with a fire in their bellies to be a strong contributing factor in the creation of something truly GREAT and wholly INSPIRING, with the tenacity to see it thru to the end! (Plus any and all who want to come for a bit and share in the excitement and add their energetic footprint to a worthy cause!)
If you are like me you have seen the dismal state that our beautiful mother Gaia has found herself in because of mankind's greed, unawareness and shortsightedness, and you see that if WE as a species ever want to manage to survive on this AMAZING planet, you see that MAJOR CHANGES MUST occur,,, and SOON!
Now also you must realise that IF we are to ever get the majority of humans on board with the eco-balanced, sustainable and soul-fulfilling lifestyle that will facilitate the continuing survival of our species then you know that we are going to HAVE to take the eco lifestyle to a higher, more sexy and ATTRACTIVE level. This means moving it to a place that the MAINSTREAM population can view it as a truly VIABLE, ACCEPTABLE and DESIRABLE way of life. 
We simply must move our sustainability from the hippy, wonky, and primitive poop-in-a-bucket far left to a more moderate , clean and orderly way of things.
 Think about it, how can we shift all the great things being done in this emerging field into a cohesive, technically advanced, unifying, cyclical, waste-free, planet-protecting, soul-soaringly fulfilling, self-balancing, UNSTOPPABLE revolution? Well, SOMEONE has got to PUT IT all TOGETHER into a VISION that gives life to that possibility!!

So to that end we have a CONCEPTUAL VISION description that paints a picture of what we are ultimately aiming for. This is a living document that grows and changes as we do. AGAIN, this is THE VISION, written in the present tense as if it already exists and is intended to SPEAK it into BEING!
 (Please be aware that this IS NOT what we have at the moment, it is what we are seeking to grow into! )
If after reading it you desire to grow WITH US, then PLEASE contact us for further exploration of your involvement!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22779&quot;&gt;Sky Meadow Retreat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; For people who are disillusioned with the world, have set themselves on a path to wellness, and are looking for meaningful work, a simple home-based lifestyle, and daily support from a small, conscious community to become more present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sky-meadow-retreat/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sky-meadow-retreat/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Seeking Co-managers for Holistic Eco-Retreat Center, Organic Farm, and Conscious Community in Vermont 
Sky Meadow Retreat, a unique sole-proprietor business in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom, is looking for several qualified people to manage the retreat and/or organic farm. You must have experience growing large gardens and permaculture crops for year-round self-sufficiency in a cold climate and/or managing a holistic residential retreat center focused on wellness and personal growth, including digital marketing and outreach. 
The retreat hosts small groups of 10-16 people for retreats of 2 days to 2 weeks, as well as individual and couple's solos focused on personal growth, wellness, and spirituality.  It is located on 120 acres secluded at the end of a road in the small town of Stannard, Vermont on a 150 year old homestead, and has been operating since 1999. The primary building is a large newly renovated barn, and the land surrounding it has been gently landscaped to include swimming ponds, open fields, wooded trails, and a hilltop with expansive views of the Green Mountains. 
In addition to the retreat, Sky Meadow is a working organic homestead growing much of the food for residents and guests, cutting wood for heat and building materials, and maintaining the buildings and land with primary concern for the integrity of nature and health of the environment. We are a truly holistic retreat center in that we source many of our needs from this land using our own labor, keeping us connected to the earth and part of our environment. We believe that connecting with the land in this way is an integral part of healing for ourselves and others.
The retreat is currently managed by a single founder/owner/resident with the help of interns who stay anywhere from several months to several years. We are looking for skilled and experienced people with long-term interest in forming a conscious community supportive of each other’s personal and spiritual growth. It is an ideal situation for someone who is looking for a home-based lifestyle integrated with nature, and a conscious residential community in a beautiful quiet setting. 
You should have some experience with small business, retreat centers, hosting guests and managing interns, as well as rural community living and organic homesteading. Above all you should be dedicated to your own personal growth and awakening, seeking intensive support in the form of intentional community, and passionate about serving the spiritual advancement of humanity. You will be working closely in collaboration with the founder to understand the current vision and systems and how they all work together. 
Compensation for managers includes housing in a beautiful, fully equipped and self-contained private apartment or cabin, access to staple vegetarian foods including all produce grown on the homestead, all utilities including hi-speed internet and phone, and a starting salary of $500/month, or your share of the net proceeds at the end of the year, whichever is greater. In coordination with the daily work required to maintain the retreat and farm, managers will be able to utilize the retreat facilities to lead group retreats and/or offer healing services such as massage or counseling.
This is a lifestyle fully supportive of your personal and spiritual development where there is space, time, and encouragement for self-nurturing and the intention is to use every interaction as an opportunity to become more present and conscious. You will be living and working as part of a small conscious community in a stunning natural setting that offers tranquility and seclusion plus meaningful connections with people and nature. The work is varied, challenging, and fulfilling as it contributes to the well-being of humanity and all of life.  
The Details
Becoming a manager of Sky Meadow Retreat is a full-time occupation requiring you to live and work here. We expect you to make this your primary life focus and fully dedicate yourself to this home-based, homesteading lifestyle. If you have needs which require you to go out or be away more than several times a week, this is not for you. 
Being here is a commitment to a different kind of lifestyle, one that is more whole and integrated, where you work where you live and provide for your own needs as much as possible from the land around you.  To maintain the stillness and integrity of this sanctuary, we ask that you limit your car trips in and out, reduce your internet and phone use, be mindful of your resource use and trash generated, and simplify your life.  If you have debts or financial obligations beyond taking care of your personal day to day needs, this situation will likely not work for you. 
This works best for people who's needs are simple, who enjoy being quiet in nature, are looking for a small intimate community of friends on a similar spiritual path, and want to settle in to a long term sustainable living situation that uses less resources and requires less money.  You will most likely have to change your habits of consumption and simplify your life, exchanging meaningful work and the support of an intimate community for all the variety of entertainment, comforts, and stimulation that many of us have grown accustomed to in our society. 
Here we achieve security by developing presence and learning to let go of the myriad fears generated by an untamed mind.  You will be encouraged to find stability within yourself, in your relationship with your inner source, instead of the accumulation or over-use of resources. Here our entertainment and nourishment comes from working and being with each other in present time, being in nature, and hosting guests who come for healing. 
We structure our weeks with 5 working/community days and two personal/free days, allowing flexibility for circumstances such as longer retreats or homesteading/gardening tasks that require attention outside of these  hours. It is important that all residents and interns structure non-working down time here for personal well-being and maintenance of a relaxed and productive lifestyle. At the same time, as a manager of a business, you should expect to put in extra hours as needed.
The homestead has its own yearly rhythm of work which is most intensified from April – November when we don't have snow on the ground.  The retreat is shut down December – March, and our busy season tends to be May – October.  The winter months offer more relaxed days focused on indoor projects such as building maintenance and office work, including marketing and retreat planning.  This is also a time when long-term residents and managers can arrange longer time away for travel or teaching.
The process of becoming a manager begins with a Conscious Living Internship for at least a month. This initial phase is intended to allow you time to become familiar with Sky Meadow, the way things work now, and the skills which form the foundation for the community, including Insight Meditation and Conscious Communication. No money is exchanged during this period:  you do not pay us to be here, and we do not pay you for your help. This is an initial trial period, which may last several months, in order to discover if we are compatible and can work and live together with each of us getting our needs met.
There is a high degree of structure here compared to some other communities or centers. On working days, we meditate together in silence from 7:00 – 7:30, check-in at 9:00 to set up the day, eat lunch together at noon, and have focused work periods from 9-12 and 2-5.  There is an optional evening mediation from 5-5:30 and we are on our own for breakfasts and dinners.  On personal days you are free to structure your time as you choose. 
Interns commit to work at least 30 hours/week for the retreat and homestead, doing a variety of tasks, many of which require physical labor outdoors.  The work is always varied and can be challenging in ways that build your strength without depleting or injuring yourself. The rest of your time here can be devoted to your personal business such as teaching or healing work, or your personal growth and spiritual nourishment.  We meet as a community one evening a week for a longer personal and confidential check-in, taking care of day to day business, and long-term planning, including scheduling time away or use of the facilities for your own retreat or healing work.  
As a community devoted to personal growth and consciousness we meet at another time each week to focus on Meditation and Conscious Communication. This is an opportunity to get feedback and direction for your practice of meditation and learn and practice the skills of Conscious Communication. We have found that both of these are essential for a healthy and vibrant conscious community, and focusing on them together once a week keeps them fresh and alive, enabling us to better utilize them in daily life.
We ask that you take the time to learn these skills and practice them at Sky Meadow, in addition to any other personal practices you already have. This allows us to share a foundation of tools that enable presence and interrupt the habit of thought that tends to consume and distract us. 
To be a candidate for manager you must already have some proficiency in interpersonal communication, silent sitting meditation, self-awareness, and ability to surrender personal preferences and ideologies. You must be self-motivated, able to assume full responsibility for several “departments” or areas of work at Sky Meadow, be accountable, self-disciplined, efficient, and able to see the big picture while also tending to small details. You will need to be comfortable working in close collaboration and under the supervision of Miles, the retreat founder, to understand the systems and procedures developed here for the past 30 years, before making changes.
You must be able to focus, be present, and learn new skills quickly and efficiently. You will put in a minimum of 40 hours of work per week, and often more, doing what needs to be done while at the same time taking care of your basic needs. You will be eligible for a share of the income from Sky Meadow and may negotiate a monthly stipend until that income is available.  You will also be eligible for one of the larger living spaces such as the Pond House cabin more suited for long-term residency. Managers with long term interests and potential will also have the opportunity to become partners in the retreat center business.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22780&quot;&gt;East Brook Community Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We aspire to build an egalitarian and democratic community here, and especially seek those with similar cooperative aspirations!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/east-brook-community-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/east-brook-community-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Community forming on 90 acres in Walton, NY. A small group of us have recently purchased the land with the intention of building a peaceful, active, socially engaged and resilient community based in permaculture, regenerative farming, cooperation, and ecological living. We are farmers ourselves and are starting a whole-farm CSA this year created as a worker’s coop and seek others will join us in that who are also interested in right livelihood and in all aspects of growing things: veggies, animals, tree and plant nursery, mushrooms, herbs, bees, etc.  The land and community can support folks with other skillsets and entrepreneurial passions too, and could be a base for small crafts, blacksmithing, child and adult education, permaculture design and installation, wildcrafting, and much more, even for those who work online,  or have a passion for hospitality like organizing farm stays and retreats.

We share the values of and aspire to FEC membership (thefec.org) in the future, but are also open to exploring possibilities with potential community members who may not be seeking a shared income, but who seek a homestead of their own and may be interested in a Community Land Trust-type equity-sharing arrangement.

We are just starting up and don't have a lot of income yet, but we think we are situated to do well and are willing to share what we have. We currently have shared housing available in a large farmhouse for worker coop members, and opportunities on the land for independent homesteads (and tent sites) as well. The land has good soil, multiple springs, a large stream, and is in the beautiful western Catskills about 2 miles from Walton, NY, and 150 miles from New York City. 

 We are open and welcoming to folks of all races, gender identification, sexual orientations, faiths, etc. and are kid and family friendly.

Our website is a work in progress http://www.eastbrookfarm.com/ (we could use some web experts here), and w're on FB and you can call us at: 607 865 5529 or email us at eastbrookcommunityfarm(at)gmail.com.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22781&quot;&gt;Hidden Meadow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To create a small community that will be a wonderful place to live now and play a strong positive role in a transition to genuine sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/hidden-meadow/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/hidden-meadow/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We currently own the property in question and are looking to live there with people who share our commitment to creating a genuinely sustainable society. The building site is on a rocky slope that overlooks a small, sheltered meadow. This housing effort is part of a larger initiative to sustainably develop a 185-acre parcel in St. Albans, VT, on the Georgia town line. Vermont Organics Reclamation is currently operating on the site (see www.vermontorganics.org), and we are looking to undertake approximately a dozen other projects ranging from an agroforestry project that seeks to reproduce what may have been done here by native Americans to a green business center elsewhere on the parcel.

By definition, unsustainable activities cannot continue indefinitely: sustainability is inevitable. What is not inevitable is the comfortable lifestyles to which we have become accustomed. We want to make significant contributions to a good transition to a genuinely sustainable and prosperous society and hope to find others willing to make positive contributions to some part(s) of this effort.</description>

We plan to be environmentally sustainable - producing all the energy we use.  We plan to have a very small footprint.  Our housing will be as near passive as possible, and our energy will be produced by Solar panels to the grid and possibly some form of geo thermal.  We have no garden but are connected to the college which as a small farm.  We have ready and free access to nature through proximity to the 1300 acre Glen Helen Reserve and state and county parks. We hope to have a senior complex with full handicapped access.  We hope to be governed by the principles of Dynamic Governance.  At present we have 45 members and hope to expand to some 60 persons living in 24-34 units.  We plan to be a sharing community that has a common space with kitchen, laundry, office, meeting room and outdoor area with play and picnic area, composting site, and floral gardens.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22783&quot;&gt;Grace: Sanctuary For The Conscious Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to create a regenerative sanctuary for the conscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/grateful-4-grace/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/grateful-4-grace/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are at the beginning of this journey. Formerly a co-housing space held for music events. We are currently in the process of transitioning to a more diversified sanctuary that benefits our new members and the community around it.

Our vision is to utilize the property to create community through the establishment of it's own ethical food source, music, art, and various other modes of healing the mind, body &amp;amp; soul.

We plan to incorporate permaculture techniques both in the physical and social sense. We plan to have compost toilets and outdoor kitchens. We envision buses, rv's, tiny houses, and tents to occupy our land. We will turn sand into luscious black gold. We will collect the water from the sky and use it to bathe and wash our dishes. We will create a maker's space for maker's of all types.

We plan on further developing our entrepreneur-like dreams on the property which will take many forms such as a farm-to-table kitchen, recording studio for musicians, &amp;amp; bicycle mechanic shop.  Creating an income doing what we we love to do within the comfort of our own sanctuary.

We would like to host you. At this time we can only take people that we feel bring balance to our current timeline. This being said, we are actively seeking builders, carpenters,  resource accumulators, grant-writers, healers, musicians, artists, permaculturists, arborists, labors, raw vegan/vegan chefs, homesteaders, upcyclers, minimalists, non-profit business managers, yoga instructors, flow artists,  well installers, natural pool builders, &amp;amp; people with earth skills we havent mentioned that you think may apply.

Typical stays are for 4 days unless an agreement is reached for special situations which may require more time.
we currently are working on building our first garden and wil not have enough food for visitors so we ask that you are able to take care of yourself for the most part. We appreciate a non-gmo environment. We try to live as harmoniously with the environment as possible so earth-friendly products are appreciated.</description>

Thus we make room for creativity and personal fulfilment in the context of each individual’s privacy and spiritual freedom. In the way we live together, in the way we care for the land and in the things we make, we intend to uphold the ideals of Camphill, in which each contributes what he or she is able to, and receives in turn what he or she needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/glenora-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/glenora-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Glenora Farm is owned and operated by the Ita Wegman Association of British Columbia for Curative Education and Social Therapy, a non-profit organization and a registered charity with the Canada Revenue Agency.

We live, play and work within the urban setting of North Vancouver to accomplish this. The community celebrates the striving of the human spirit in many ways. We honour the contribution each person makes to the community.

Our vision requires both a healthy residential community and a vibrant centre for artisan crafts, training and therapy. Currently this encompasses a community of five homes and a Centre dedicated to the development of the potential of each individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-cascadia-society-for-social-working/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-cascadia-society-for-social-working/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Cascadia is a life-sharing community. Its home is the urban setting of Vancouver’s North Shore, with several residences and a day centre.  Cascadia  is more than just a job or a safe place to spend a few hours each day. It is a way of life where each participant can make a meaningful contribution to the community, and where challenges are provided for everyone to grow in dignity and freedom to the fullest potential. Cultural, artistic and therapeutic experiences are provided through residential home care and day activities within the urban setting of Vancouver’s North Shore. By emphasizing the practical elements of life, skills are developed and matured. Beauty and order help to create a healthy soul atmosphere.

The coworkers responsible to the Cascadia Society have a background, ongoing education, or experience in curative education, youth guidance, or social therapy. They follow the principles of Anthroposophy developed by Rudolf Steiner, Ph.D., and the principles of the Camphill Movement, founded by Karl König, M.D. Their work is carried out as a freely given effort to care for the well-being of that inviolable human spirit within all of us, regardless of ability level.

Through meaningful activities, a healing environment, and truly human companionship, the Cascadia Society encourages each person to master their own life. This mastery occurs in the context of family, community and society. By emphasizing both independence and interdependence, Cascadia promotes individuals to become dignified and effective citizens in the community.

The Cascadia Society is a Camphill community and a member of the Camphill Association of North America.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22789&quot;&gt;Plowshare Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Plowshare Farm is an attempt to be responsive to the social, human, spiritual and ecological challenges of our times by working toward creating an environment where every person and every aspect of the natural world can be learned from and valued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/plowshare-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/plowshare-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Plowshare Farm is a community whose primary task is to serve those in need of special care.  Harmonious to this task come a wide variety of activities which support Plowshare Farm’s striving to be a vessel for the balanced and healthy unfolding of the human being.  How this manifests and the exact nature of our daily tasks are more challenging to describe.

Like a well-functioning farm (one of the things we strive to be) at Plowshare Farm there are many complexities of relationships and inter-weavings.  We are a group of people – coworkers and their families, residents, apprentices, and volunteers who live together in what we call lifesharing homes.  We are a biodynamic farm.  We are bakery, woodwork and candle-making workshops.  We are a vocational training center for people with special needs who join us during the day time.  We are a ‘safe port’ for those who, within their lives’ journeys, need some time in a haven for repair.  We are fertile ground for other initiatives to meet, germinate and grow.  We are a place where the line between caregiver and care receiver is blurred through the understanding that we each have something to learn from the other and that caring for someone or something else is often a very fine path for self-development.

At the heart of these layers is a conscious reaching toward the unfolding of what is truly human in us.  Questions such as: &quot;What am I, in my deepest Self, striving toward?” or &quot;What is my nobler Self and how might I become it?&quot; are questions which all of us, coworkers, residents, apprentices and volunteers, have an opportunity to explore within the structure of our daily lives.  As a community we carry the questions: How can we reach toward a relationship with our natural resources that is sustainable?  How can we participate in bringing about social renewal?  How can we stand as a beacon for conscious, interdependent living?</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22793&quot;&gt;SEED International Ecovillage Agricommunity near Cahuita National Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We're an ecovillage within an international partnership that's developing sustainability prototypes in ecological education and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/seed-international-ecovillage-near-cahuita-national-park/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/seed-international-ecovillage-near-cahuita-national-park/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Humanity is facing unprecedented challenges.  Rapid urbanization and depletion of natural resources, combined with the impacts of climate change, are forcing us to rethink our current patterns of living and to develop much more sustainable practices, including eco-villages.  Worldwide, societies urgently need to promote and advance viable examples of intentional, green communities.    
  
We're an international ecovillage within a partnership that's developing sustainability prototypes in ecological education and development.  Right now SEED is creating several model projects simultaneously, including an International Community for Sustainable Living in rural Costa Rica, located in the tropical southern Caribbean region near Cahuita National Park.   

Our growing eco-community is seeking like-minded individuals, couples and families interested in actively living sustainably using permaculture principles.  You’re invited to consider joining our International Community for Sustainable Living project.  'We hope that our website provides you with enough information to decide if our ecovillage community may be the one that you’ve been searching for.

We're a group of energetic, enthusiastic and committed individuals, dedicated to working with others to accomplish the common vision of an international ecovillage.  Currently citizens of Costa Rica, Canada, Columbia, Germany and the U.S.A are property-owning members of the community.  There are presently more than a dozen community families, with the residential aspect currently mostly weekend and seasonal.  Including community residences and SEED Agroecology Demonstration Center buildings, there are now over a dozen structures.

SEED International Community for Sustainable Living home sites are in the foothills of the Talamanca Mountain Range, in Cahuita District, Talamanca Canton, Limon Province, in the tropical southern Caribbean region of Costa Rica.  The elevation above sea level is between about 31 and about 166 meters, and the geographic coordinates of the Agroecology Demonstration Center are 9°42’06.43”N and 82°52’07.44”W.   

Our community is comprised of members who own ½ hectare (~1.25 acre) private lots within the 140-hectare (~245 acre) sustainability focused SEED corporation. The six founding members of the International Community together hold the SEED corporation partnership shares.  SEED is the acronym for the partnership - Society for Ecological Education and Development.

Individuals, couples and families that are interested in learning to live a potentially carbon-neutral, sustainable lifestyle are eligible for membership in the community.  SEED International Community for Sustainable Living members have the unique opportunity of benefiting from the experience and knowledge of fellow ecovillage members.  Current areas of community member expertise include sustainable building, safe water and waste management, renewable energy, agroecology, and landscape design.

The topography of SEED is a mix of hills, valleys, plateaus and rivers.  The Carbon II River, Cañajira River, Hone Creek and Cane Creek form the borders of the SEED corporation property.  Various ongoing sustainable projects are underway at SEED.  Thirty percent of the total SEED land is primary forest, 20 percent secondary forest and the remaining 50 percent was until recently used extensively for raising livestock. 

Land use at SEED is undergoing a transformation, with the international ecovillage being an important component in a master plan focused solely on sustainability projects.  All of the SEED corporation partners are also SEED International Community members, with each owning residential property in the ecovillage.  All subsequent SEED residential property owners are invited to join the community as fellow members.  Property owners are encouraged to maintain active memberships in SEED International Community, and enjoy the member benefits while living a sustainable lifestyle.  

Please consider a visit to experience the power and possibilities of sustainable living for yourself.  If you see value in our project, perhaps you’ll become a part of the growing membership of SEED International Ecovillage.  Lots in Residential Area 2 are presently filling, and a final residential zone is planned.  If you have a question after looking over our ‘SEEDcostarica’ website and Facebook page, please contact us at SEEDcostarican@gmail.com.</description>

The following statements represent the specific ways that we are called to bless the world together as a family.
Our Vision (The great need in the world to which we are called):
To live in and for God’s joy as a vibrant family of Jesus so that such communities are cultivated in close reach of everyone.
Our Mission (How our community can meet the need described in our Vision):
To discover and embody what it means to be a vibrant family of Jesus – an ecosystem of God’s gifts – and to train others to share this way of life.
Our Aim (What we are doing, near term, to fulfill our Mission):
To take the steps necessary to purchase, build, and begin full-time operation of the Eden Center by January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/eden-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/eden-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Eden Community is a Christian intentional community located in Abilene, TX. We are in the process of building an cohousing ecovillage, permaculture farm, and retreat/training facility called the Eden Center in the mesas of the Callahan Divide about 20 miles Southeast of town. Currently our community consists of three families, totaling six adults and four children, and we are actively pursuing new members who fit with our values, mission, and way of life.</description>

It provides members with a rural natural environment in which to live, work, and/or spend recreational time in a continuing context of sharing and community. 

The co-op owns our 700 acres of land, mostly rough bush in its natural state. It is no longer the working &quot;farm&quot; of fifty years ago, but we do have gardens and a few fields. Our buildings include houses, workshops, and outbuildings. 

Currently we are a small, loose-knit but stable group of seven resident members (currently all adults over 60) in four households, and several non-resident members, all linked by various long-term friendships and a love for this piece of land. Resident members work in individual home businesses (wood-workers, weaver, artist, writer/translator) or are retired. Incomes are separate and houses individually owned, while the land itself is owned collectively.

We look out for each other as good friends and neighbours, and take care of each other's animals and houses if someone is away. We hold an annual general meeting, and have occasional potlucks and gatherings. Several adult children of members visit often, and are developing their own group structure for their connection to this place. Residents are quite involved in the local community, through the community centre, choir, library, and other activities.

We are not actively looking for new members, but could be open to inquiries from Canadian residents living within a few hours' drive. People might get to know us gradually through a series of short visits. There are several approved house sites that new members could build on. Costs of joining include a one-time, non-returnable membership contribution, and house construction.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22798&quot;&gt;The Best is Yet to Come&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To Thrive in a land of uncertainty as our forefathers did. To follow in the path that God has set for you. To learn what the path God has for your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-best-is-yet-to-come/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-best-is-yet-to-come/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Core principals align with the Bible, Declaration of Independence, The Bill of Rights, and the Constitution.
Those that believe &quot;The Great Experiment&quot; has succeeded, will Succeed.
Believes that truth, Justice, and the American way will never die. 

It goes with out saying that when a group of people mutually pledge to each other their Lives, Fortunes and Sacred Honor, Devine providence prevails.

In day to day life,  a few rules in interaction with others.
1. if it's not yours, leave it alone.
2. If one has nothing good to say, say nothing.
3. Treat others as you would expect to be treated.

Simple principals. Don't you think?
Helping those in need is up to each individual. No demands on anyone will be made.
What else needs to be said?
Ask me anything.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22799&quot;&gt;Nama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Cohousing/ cooperative life:  a Nourishing Supportive Home for families, elders, and youth, with events from time to time and inter-generational life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/nama/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/nama/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a committed couple of artist-farmers, together since 2004.
Seeking to Join or to Build a community supporting homesteading &amp;amp; wildlife, with open and wooded land, potential for livestock and a vegetable farm, growing veggies and fruits for our line of Nama's Farmhouse Preserves.  We have been working with heirloom vegetables, and interested in seed saving and a small regional seed company of resilient varieties for a changing climate.

We envision a healing bodywork practice there or nearby, and space for creative and expressive arts experiences.  A land-based, TransitionTown-minded community life is our goal, and we are ready to open dialogue with people interested in building together. 

We would like to build our own home with super-local and sustainable materials.
We have been raising vegetables, preserving foods, keeping a small flock of chickens, and selling our wares at farmers' markets since 2010.  We have moved our farm three times in eight years of growing in Vermont.  We have found we can grow food almost anywhere, but it's the people to live in community with that matter most.


Nate is a professional massage therapist/healer, veggie grower, performer, and writer. 
Ama is a chef/ culinary creatrix, veggie grower, textile artist, graphic designer, and poet.

Some values &amp;amp; goals of ours:
Human Values and Ecological Values held in balance:
Spiritual Connection &amp;amp; Relationship with Earth, a peaceful Home where All Beings are Respected
Honesty, Love, Thoughtfulness, Intelligence, Artistic Expression and Appreciation.
Diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, skills and talents.
Knowledge of Nature's Wisdom &amp;amp; Science.
Skills in caring for each other &amp;amp; children, the land, plants, animals, mutual property &amp;amp; ones own emotional/matters. 
Valuing one's own healing, humility, gratitude, self-knowledge, and spiritual development.

We love Vermont, and feel this is an excellent place to stay and grow.  The kindness and community resiliency following Hurricane Irene in 2011 was marvelous! We have made many friends here. However, it has been difficult to overcome the constant suction of &quot;the machine&quot;/digital communications and distractions of modern life.  Most people seem too busy to take time to regularly connect.  We would like to be present with and responsive to the natural world including our human connections.

It feels clear the time is now to form or join a community.  We believe that we can fulfill our personal need for connection and work purpose by living with shared goals and private life, based in the attuned working of soil and forest for food and fuel &amp;amp; building together, learning sustainable skills, making amazing meals, music, and art.  
Together we can be happier, heal our souls, and heal the earth we steward.

One Love,
Nate &amp;amp; Ama

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22800&quot;&gt;The Nyingma Mandala Training Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our Focus

    Integrating spiritual growth with work that gets results
    Putting our study and practice into action
    Serving the Dharma and supporting Buddhist practitioners
    Working for the benefit of all beings

This way of studying and practicing the Dharma is a challenging and rewarding adventure. We have accomplished huge amounts for such a small community. We continue to learn new skills and deepen our understanding of the teachings, and we see every day as an opportunity for growth and accomplishment.

Day by day, we are building a model for how a Buddhist community can flourish in the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-nyingma-mandala-training-program/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-nyingma-mandala-training-program/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Tarthang Tulku came to this country because he saw America as a land of opportunity, where he could work to preserve and transmit the teachings that his teachers had passed on to him. He emphasized getting tangible results, with a special focus on preserving sacred texts and creating communities built around Buddhist principles.

Today, his older students are working to pass that vision on to others. Our aim is to create an enduring legacy and a home for the Dharma in the West.

The Mandala Training Program is for individuals inspired by that vision and ready to give their energy to making it happen. When you make that commitment, a dynamic path to inner growth and transformation opens before you.

The Mandala Training Program is a 6-month, residential work-study program that introduces students to our approach to the study and practice of Buddhism and participate in the community’s way of life. Students live and work in our downtown Berkeley Nyingma residential community. We dedicate our efforts full-time toward serving the Dharma and deepening our own understanding.</description>

We tend to be into health, outdoors, permaculture , environmental awareness, music, yoga, meditation, NVC, counseling, qi gong, hiking, etc. But mostly, we just want good people who want to be in casual community and who are willing to work through challenges when they do arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/woodacre-co-housing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/woodacre-co-housing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a newly forming, kid-friendly community, inspired by permaculture and co-housing paradigms. We started with two adjacent properties in a sunny part of Woodacre; the total land is about 2/3 of an acre. We've been knocking down the fence between the properties and planting gardens. It's already gorgeous and it's just getting better over time! There will be 4 households by May 1 (available now). So far there are 5 of us - we are one adult couple and two single adults happily co-parenting our 7-year-old girl.

We started out as neighbors and we're becoming like family. It's a small but revolutionary model ... and if you resonate, we'd love to hear from you! Let us know something about yourself and what you're looking for, and how best to reach you.</description>

This will be an arts based village designed and managed by the residents to encourage aging with purpose, sharing of talents, and mentoring South Salt Lake residents of all ages, incomes and abilities. The village will contain studio, rehearsal, and performance and exhibition spaces to serve residents and the community at large. Engagements in the arts will promote greater purpose, and cognition and creativity for the village residents who will be focused on enriching the lives of others in the community by promoting arts enthusiasm and social engagement. The village will be a conduit for lifelong learning in the arts, based on the understanding that this is healthy for older people, intergenerational mentoring is necessary, and establishing a role for older artists and teachers in the community is imperative.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22804&quot;&gt;The Grateful Belly Collective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission here at the farm is to get off grid and be self-sustainable. We are looking for driven individuals who wish to improve their quality of life by joining with others who share the common desire for community and autonomy. We believe that this can be achieved by working together as a community rather than individuals. Many hands make light work. We want our children and ourselves to live free and experience life as it should be lived...without constraints. We have a 7-acre property with very fertile soil where we can grow our own food and stay out of the grocery store. We know that whoever controls the food, controls the people. Let's take that control back and live free! Let's work hard and celebrate with potlucks and a bonfire. Let's breathe and not be stressed out by poverty and isolation! If this sounds like you, please contact us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-grateful-belly-collective/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-grateful-belly-collective/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a family-friendly farm located on 7 acres in Western TN. Our mission is to become self-sustainable by growing our own food, relying on alternative energy sources, and working together as a community to ensure the well being and prosperity of all of our members. We are planning on selling our produce at farmer's markets and at our store at our farm. Our goal is to have our farm-based business supporting the farm so that we can stay here and work on what matters. We currently have 10 adults and 10 children here. We currently do not have a community cabin built and therefore, you must have something to live/sleep in while visiting. There is a rather large open barn that you could pitch a tent in as to not get rained on. We do not have extra tents. We require anyone who wants to visit contact either Jen or Chris so that we can plan for your arrival. We have a strict no-violence policy here. It is not tolerated and you will be told to leave. We look forward to meeting you!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22805&quot;&gt;Possibilitarian Regenerative Community Homestead (PORCH)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; PORCH’s mission is to create a biodiverse community space that is healing, welcoming, educational, inclusive and nourishing through gardening communally; creating ecological restorative demonstration sites; and holding open community work days, workshops, and festive outdoor social gatherings in the Buckeye neighborhood of Cleveland.

We imagine a future where people work cooperatively to support individual thrivelihoods while stewarding the land and community culture simultaneously building a resilient and diverse ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/possibilitarian-regenerative-community-homestead-porch/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/possibilitarian-regenerative-community-homestead-porch/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;PORCH stands for Possibilitarian Regenerative Community Homestead. In basic terms, PORCH is a house with 2 kitchens, 2 bathrooms, five bedrooms, 2 shared living/dining room gathering spaces, 2 porches and a large community permaculture garden attached.  PORCH is a 5 years developing, and currently newly burgeoning, opportunity to live in a structured community environment, where collective work and engagement with the community are included in the housing agreement. There are currently 2 residents in the house, and 2 official non-resident collaborators.  We are looking for 3 new people to live in the house  starting as soon as May 2016.   Applicants should be interested in engaging with community, as well as working to maintain and improve upon an intentional community homestead model.

We are all about exploring what's possible through a community of shared values of people care, earth care and fair share... which translates to the values of communication, accountability and respect, creativity, open community, collective labor and collaboration, direct democracy, social and political consciousness, resilience and diversity, safer space, playfulness, inclusion, and place-based activism.

      <name>Shekinah Eco Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22806&quot;&gt;Shekinah Eco Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Shekinah Eco-Village is a vibrant neighborhood of clustered homes facing a common house and is based on principles of beauty, sustainability, and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/shekinah-eco-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/shekinah-eco-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Susan Manning, the founder of Shekinah Eco Village saw first hand as a real estate broker for nearly 25 years how much waste was created building homes, how shoddily built, even the most luxurious homes really were when it came to saving energy, and determined to do something about it. After many years of designing homes, researching new building methods and much trial and error, Shekinah Eco-Village was created. 

Shekinah Eco-Village is a net-zero highly sustainable, green, off–the-grid community. Most eco-villages look like a throwback to the 60's love child movement. Susan had a brighter vision. Eighteen homes will be nestled together with a common house on ten acres including four greenhouses providing all the electricity and heat each needs.  Susan is all about sustainability, yet it will look like a modern, beautiful neighborhood with lush gardens, sparkling water and benches to enjoy it all that anyone would desire to live in. Privacy is valued in each private dwelling, yet the opportunities exist for a close-knit neighborhood. You choose how much to interact.

Shekinah Eco-Village is based on personal freedom coupled with a collective wisdom that can only be had by active listening. We co-operate on many levels and work hard to minimize conflict, but are courageous enough to face it and work through it. Our community is beautiful inside and out. We intend a close-knit community through shared meals, gardens and work projects. Everything we do, we do with seven generations in mind: how will this impact them?

The common center includes a commercial kitchen, dining area, library/music room, meditation room, rooms for guests, massage room, craft room, and exercise area. Working together we can be free of so much: utility bills, high food costs, loneliness, ill health, and stress. With such an expansive common center, homes can comfortably have smaller footprints and still live large.

The ideal atmosphere is manifestation of the divine presence (the definition of the term Shekinah) and for our community it means whatever you deem &quot;divine&quot; to be, involving respect for the land, for one another and peace, joy, contentment and brotherly kindness.

While it seems isolated, it is actually only three miles from shopping, a college, library, medical facilities and churches.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22807&quot;&gt;Ben Badawi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To establish &amp;amp; maintain a small neighbor-feeding farm community, both agriculturally and socially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ben-badawi/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ben-badawi/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;NOTE: My original intent for forming a small farming community has changed dramatically in the last six weeks, as has the location. Things are moving FAST and I'm having trouble finding the time to update this description, but I've changed the basics in order to avoid misleading interested others:

There is work to do while healthy, intelligent individuals are daydreaming their lives away, so instead of “starting” a community, I’m inviting interested others to share in the difficult jobs &amp;amp; responsibilities of developing a community-based market farm (to feed our most vulnerable neighbors with little or no money changing hands) in rural Matagorda County, Texas. Whether your commitment is short- or long-term, the community can form itself however it forms.

Participants’ active physical/intellectual/emotional involvement is more important than their material assets, so unless you’re an ax murderer or a religious nut, we can exchange your work for a place to exist outside whatever rat race you feel is slowly killing you. My bank account hangs just above zero more often than not, but I have extensive knowledge &amp;amp; experience in different elements of establishing &amp;amp; maintaining a holistic/sustainable garden system and, as a career public school teacher, I’ve gotten pretty good at fostering community out of whatever motley crew walks through the doorway. Right now, though, it’s just me. Another plans to join me in August 2016.

It doesn’t really matter what part of the system you currently live in that irritates you enough to make you want to escape it, but it’ll be energizing to talk about it over a meal at the end of the day. There’s only a place for adults &amp;amp; older teens right now, but the only established rule for living is that we not apply our favorite religions to others, so everything else is pretty flexible.

It’s going to be a while before this unusual idea becomes more than a grassy shelf above the coastal plain, so we’ll want to discuss the substance of your interest before you commit to anything (your only “posh” accommodations will be your sleeping bag &amp;amp; tent, for instance, but we can easily build adequate shelter before winter... which lasts a couple of weeks, tops). Regrading a couple of trouble spots and establishing a trial food source are the current priorities, but I know a lot about low-impact, climate-responsive construction so you’ll learn a lot about passive cooling in a hot/humid climate &amp;amp; how to swing a hammer, depending on the number of participants at any given time.

If you can cook or play an instrument, you’re automatically at the top of my wish list; however, your strong back &amp;amp; willingness to share ideas &amp;amp; responsibilities is the dealmaker.

If this isn’t your idea of fun &amp;amp; fulfillment, then peace and best wishes to you. If it is, contact me.</description>

I’m looking to create a space that caters to alternative sexuality/lovestyle/lifestyle intersectional leftist/liberal/progressive/radical social-justice-caring-about types, especially kinky people/kinksters. Geeks of any &amp; all stripes preferred. In short, I’m trying to build a chosen family, of a sort, to live in a home together. I want it to be a place where people can be their whole selves at home &amp; be accepted. We will do our best to accommodate everyone’s disabilities, physical, mental, developmental, etc., so that everyone can live in a nice happy home. A place where you feel loved for who you are, regardless of what that may entail. A place you feel comfortable enough to live your life to the fullest &amp; where the environment enables you to do so.</description>

Visiting all kinds of places where people live in an alternative, off-grid and permaculture ways. During this trip we made short films about inspiring people who showed us their little paradises. If you want to have a look, check out our blog lemondrops.mobi.

The trip finally led us to a beautiful piece of land on a mountain slope in the Sierra Nevada. In 2013 we moved from the Netherlands to Spain to turn this abandoned land into our self-sufficient dream place. The land was a blank page to us when we arrived, so we had to start from scratch to create the basic needs and some luxury. We have dug, built, planted, created and discovered a lot since we have moved. It is has been a truly inspiring and fulfilling experience.

Since 2014 it’s not just the two of us anymore: Charlotte is our new mountain dweller. With her by our site we enjoy even more the time and freedom we have here in this new life. But we also realized that it would be great to have more families with young kids around. That's why we are looking for you!</description>

Further, we seek to develop a model that enables us to counsel others who have land to share on the successful concepts, methods, and tools we find most helpful in our ongoing efforts to provide sustainable solutions for affordable living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/autumn-sun/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/autumn-sun/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Based on a 6-acre rural property outside the historic town of Ashland Virginia, the Autumn Sun Community is developing a master plan for an intentional inter-generational community, based around permaculture principles, community gardening, and practical green-building practices for constructing small, sustainable homes.

The community property includes a single-family home, a large shared house, a log cabin studio, small business office, and 6,000-foot warehouse, all run on 90% renewable energy. Our master plan for the property includes the development of a 5,000-square-foot home for co-housing and shared caregiving, as well as a large greenhouse. We are tiny house friendly, and welcome occasional campers.

We are an open and accepting community of individuals who enjoy art, music, exercise, and outdoor living. The community kitchen, garden, workshop, and outdoor fire ring are frequent gathering places that are open to all, and enjoyably used for fun and free-flowing conversation. Community members show respect for each other’s privacy, and spaces abound for quiet contemplation and personal reflection.

Ours is a new community with a varied mix of employment. Individual and household income is managed by each family, with revenue-sharing potential for community projects. Community decision-making is made through processes best described as Sociocratic and Modified Consensus. Currently, “work trade” is an option in exchange for all or a portion of community members’ contribution for their portion of the shared living space. 

The Autumn Sun Community is filled with entrepreneurial-minded members. We encourage knowledge-sharing and group instruction. Community member revenue may be made through participation in collaborative workshops and shared community projects, as well as the individual use of the large workshop with shared workspace and tools. The same will hold for shared use of the large greenhouse once construction is complete.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22815&quot;&gt;Serenity Cabin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our focus is Community Security. Our mission is to make our focus an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/serenity-cabin/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/serenity-cabin/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a retired engineer with a background in law enforcement and a trauma nurse who is employed a few days a week at a medical center in Seattle. We are both in our early 50s and very healthy.

We are building an off-grid compound on 6 wooded acres with forest service land on 3 sides of the property. So far, we have a main cabin (2-story A-frame) and a tiny house (80 sq. ft.) that we are using as a shed.

We have solar power with battery bank and backup generator for power. We have hot and cold running water gravity fed from artisan well. We have washer/dryer, HBO, Internet, SunMar composting toilets, and much more.

The spring, summer, and fall here are very nice. The winters are nice too but the snow can be a challenge. Harvesting firewood is a never-ending chore.

We live here full time with our 22-year-old daughter and our two pit bull terriers.

We are creative problem-solvers, we work hard, and we play just as hard. We are considerate and responsible. Politically, we align with the Libertarians. Spiritually, we align with the Christians. But we try not to label ourselves. 

We are gun-owners, we practice regularly. 

We are at the point now where we want to bring others in and start building up this community. 

A like-minded couple with the wherewithal to fund and build their own quarters, tiny house or otherwise, would be perfect.

This is not a &quot;live off the land&quot; opportunity nor is it a &quot;chop down my trees and build a cabin for free&quot; opportunity. You need skills and gear to live in the mountains, funds to sustain your lifestyle, gumption to actually fall through with your plans, and a plan.</description>

We stomp out stalkers that try to slander or harm Innocent people. Ascension is rapid spiritual development. Our goal is tranquility.
Ascension is rapid spiritual development. 

Daily survival is easy for some yet is rough for others.
Organized stalking victims require privacy, healing, dignity, respect, and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ascension-arts-retreat-ti-intentional-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ascension-arts-retreat-ti-intentional-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Welcome, victims of organized stalking may wish to heal, build trust, live privately, or expose criminals that lied, stalked, fabricated evidence, used cloned voice software (fake voice software to frame the innocent person) to incite select powerful people (mayor, bishop, chief) against the unsuspecting innocent target of the crime network. They do this to ruin credibility of person and get more funds for joint task force fusion center ops that hire pedophiles, drug addicts, neighborhood watch people as confidential informants that stalk, poison, and fabricate lots of false threats assessments reports on the innocent innocent target of organized stalking-killing-ops. 
Why, you ask – ascension!

Daily survival can get rough when there are many slanderers as well as stalker-killers using hidden warfare tactics. Additional tactics used include massive slander campaigns, drive bys, thefts, false accusations, set ups, use of unjustified nsa letters, fake voice recordings, fake video group perjury, staged accidents, incite others against him\\\\her, and so on. The distributed organized crime groups draft  new players such as cops, fireworkers to do atrocious hateful spying, slanders. also worse.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22818&quot;&gt;Southern Nevada Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Build an intergenerational community within an urban environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/southern-nevada-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/southern-nevada-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Is it possible to grow community in the Nevada desert? Our small group of dreamers and schemers intend to find out.  Established in 2015 by Kim Henry and Marta Thompson, SNV Cohousing has been slowly and steadily expanding in numbers ever since.  Ours will be the first cohousing community in Nevada, so that means we are working hard to educate our future partners as well as prospective members on what it means.  And, yes, when we hear the comment “So it’s like a commune, right?” we smile, take a deep breath and recite what cohousing really is. 
We’re currently 5 households strong and have already identified a site in the historic Water Street District of Henderson in the Las Vegas valley.  We’ve gotten a warm reception from the owners of the property, the Henderson Redevelopment Agency, so are working hard to attract more members to take this project to the next stage. We envision a community of about 30 homes, intergenerational, with some commercial space fronting onto the neighborhood high street.  
 
We welcome inquiries from those living out of the area, as we know what an attractive retirement location Las Vegas is. And are willing to organize Skype visits if you would like to “attend” one of our meetings to find out more. 
Want to know more? If you don’t find the information you want on our website snvcohousing.com then shoot us an email. Kim, Marta or Michelle (snvcohousing@gmail.com) and one of us will get back to you shortly.</description>

Our site search is focused on West Acton and Maynard, Mass., two up-and-coming, walkable villages that are 60 minutes west of downtown Boston and have good services, cultural amenities, and proximity to many nature and recreation areas. We are looking for three to five acres of land on which to build a cottage-style neighborhood of 20 – 30 units with porches and gardens clustered around a common house with extensive amenities, including a gourmet kitchen, Great Room, office spaces, and guest rooms.  

Our project was launched in March 2016 by founders Victoria Thatcher and Mayhew Seavey, who spent a year consulting with cohousing leaders, town officials, developers, and architects; and also running informational meetings and workshops. In January 2017 a core group was formed and began meeting regularly. That fall we hired Katie McCamant, the nation's pre-eminent cohousing development consultant (Cohousing Solutions, Inc.) to guide us. We are moving forward with growing our group, member commitments, site search, engaging professionals, getting training in Dynamic Governance, and growing our group identity and cohesiveness.</description>

Become increasingly independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/tanglemoss-homesteading-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/tanglemoss-homesteading-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Nestled in the woods outside of Olympia, Washington, a group of friends are creating a space to become increasingly self-sufficient as an independent community. We are Tanglemoss Collective and we're hoping to get more people involved in our super rad project.

Objectives (elaboration below)
1. Collectively buy land
2. Live communally
3. Become increasingly self-sufficient
4. Share skills

Here are some ways you can support us and our project:

- Share this info and share our crowdfunding page via social media. Print this out as an info sheet or zine and post it at your local library/info shop/food co-op.
- Come live with us! We are five adult humans and a handful of non-human animals. We want to share this dream with a whole community of folks. If you’re interested in joining us, we’d love to hear from you.
- Contribute financially. If you’re not interested or able to join us right now, but want to support the cause, contributions to our Indiegogo or PayPal are greatly appreciated.
- Advice! Know anything about real estate, soil, promoting, recruiting, off-grid living, legal stuff for collectivizing, potentially becoming a non-profit or any other advice you think would be helpful? Contact us, we'd love to talk.
- Buy eggs! If you\\'re local, you can help support us by buying organic, free- range eggs from us.

More on our objectives...

1st Objective:
Collectively buy land. 
This property must meet the needs of the current participants, have long-term sustainability (water, farming acres, etc.) for our goals of becoming increasingly self-sufficient, allow plenty of living space for future community members to build dwellings, and potentially allow space for visitors, educational work trade, skill-share camp-outs, and who knows what. 

We currently have secured financing and are looking at properties. As most properties are not set up to accommodate pet goats or more than a “single family,” we anticipate initial financial burdens that greatly exceed the monthly mortgage. We are trying to make a space for a larger community using the means of just a handful of current members, so to help alleviate some of the financial burden on the founding members, we are also pursuing crowdfunding.

2nd Objective:
Live communally. 
Living communally reduces our need for manufacturing, transportation of goods and dependence on capitalism, and replaces that with the mutual aid provided by friends who trust and support each other. The community we are creating will be non-hierarchical. All decisions will be made by consensus. 

3rd Objective:
Become increasingly self-sufficient. 
Over time we want to make the property able to sustain its inhabitants without the need of outside resources. We will have electricity, plumbing, and all those luxuries, but we want to work towards not needing them, or being able to go without them indefinitely if we wanted or needed to. The climate in our area is projected to have heavier rain in the winter and drier summers, so we will build rain catching systems to help reduce the draw from our water well in the summer. We will, of course, grow our own produce, forest farm in our wooded areas, then over time start taking on more projects and mastering new skills. Some examples include growing our own wheat for flour, herbs for medicine, making oils and vinegars, building a stove out of bricks made from our soil, and spinning fibers.

4th Objective:
Share skills.
Humans are basically something of a terrible plague on the earth. Humans who lived here before us lived (and in some places continue to live) harmoniously with nature. We're hoping, with some expected trial and error, that it is still possible for us to live sustainably, without the need to import goods and resources. That's where we're hoping to get at some point. With this property, we aim to foster each others' efforts to decivilize and relearn skills for living which do not contribute to the destruction of the earth.

Thanks for reading!
We hope that you'll get involved or help us get the word out to folks who might want to get involved by donating and sharing!</description>

Some of us live together in community on the grounds, to support intention, commitment and the dedicated practice of living simply and serving others. Nationally, we offer teachings regarding meditation, dharma, wellness and personal development. This helps us transmit the full legacy of the Buddhadharma. Our own Embracing Simplicity Contemplative Order monastics and dharmacharyas (teachers) who live elsewhere offer their intermittent presence, prayer, and skills. And volunteers bearing witness, who support our global engagement with people who have been marginalized and oppressed, are showing up and responding with compassionate and empowering action.</description>

Our land is within a Geobotanical Reserve with unique flora and fauna among which there can be found orchids, hummingbirds and other endemic animals. For this reason, there is no pollution or industrial growth there. We have three hectares in the valley of the crater, where a true silence and stillness can be found.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22826&quot;&gt;Badulina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our Badulina welcome song:

You and me, we're gonna live freestyle,
At least for a while, till the day that we die,
I know we shall find a place under the sky
Where Love is the law and the truth cannot lie,
Who you've been where you going
Have you coming from far?
It don't matter for us, in the present we trust.
We know the worst criminal is a diamond covered in dust

So welcome back to your long-lost home,
You traveled from far but now you know 
you are not alone
We are millions, billions
Praying for change
One day we shall unite, gather under this name

Badulina
Open up your gates
Open up your mind
Open up your heart

[Badulina that's also title of the CD, book and beautiful song made by mystical music group.
When new people arrive I introduce them with this song text.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/badulina/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/badulina/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Welcome to Badulina, a young intentional community in South Spain. We enjoy living together with heart, mind and hands. We are from all ages and hold this land for our children and their children to grow up in abundance and harmony. We like to be healthy and open-minded and we aim for self sustainability while also enjoying the advantages of modern technology. Badulina is organized as an association. Joining members become co-owners of the project. Where we invite you to choose an area to build a home and realize your part of the Badulina dream.

We are living on easy slope of blooming terraces with fields of flowers on the fertile ground, taking a deep breath, cracking almonds, picking oranges, peaches, figs, apples and grapes already growing on the property, tasting the wealth of Mother Nature. Creating comfortable living spaces in the cooling shadow of the olive grove in a colorful mixture of creative buildings, people living and working together and hearing the laughter of our children. 

In average we are in-between 10 and 15 adults + children. We are currently 2 families with children, elders, visitors and volunteers. In the years the final goal is to reach about 25 members that have their own homes and private areas on the land. Our group is an international mixture of Dutch, Belgium, German, English and Polish people. Our common language is English.

Badulina is organized as an association that governs the whole land. Joining members need to contribute financially to become co-owners of the project. Where we invite you to choose an area to build a home and realize your part of the Badulina dream.

The place is about 9 hectares big, a whole hill with two river beds as natural barriers. We have about 2 hectares with 270 olive trees, 500 almond trees that need to be maintained and harvested and have 200 grape vines. Further a lot of herb land and over 100 fruit trees like: fig-, orange-, mandarin-, lemon-, apple-, pear-, walnut-trees, etc. We have chickens, bee hives and 3 cats.

On the land there is currently nice house in good state with electricity, water, internet, solar water heater and other basic luxuries. It is our temporary communal kitchen, community office and tool shed. Outside we have an extra kitchen, big dining table, sofas, etc. We have also a 6m communal yurt as our communal space. We also have some nice private yurts and domes spread around.

Still we are like settlers on this new land. Right now there are the communal facilities, some caravans, olive tree terraces and a nice atmosphere in nature but we need to improvise till we create facilities for the private places. We will not have fixed buildings for everyone yet. You need to build or arrange your own home on the land in time.

We are planning a big communal building, dance floor, swimming pool, water reservoir and solar system to become as community self sufficient. On the chosen private areas members can build their homes (first temporary ones that do not require building permissions), get water, electricity and internet to it and make their spaces beautiful.

We are at 500m above sea level and you can walk to the near town Orgiva. The climate is mild, it does not snow in winter, but there can be some frost in some mornings. There is almost no rain in summer and can be over 40 degrees in the midday hours.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22828&quot;&gt;Amrit Yoga Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Amrit Yoga Institute is nestled in the Ocala National Forest on Lake Kerr, an ideal site for the inward journey of spirituality and conscious awareness.

The Amrit Method incorporates Patanjali’s 8 limbs of yoga in all aspects of life. You will learn how to practically apply the formal practice of asana, pranayama and meditation in your work life and personal life thereby transforming unconscious ego reactions into skillful conscious responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/amrit-yoga-institute/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/amrit-yoga-institute/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Amrit Yoga Institute is nestled in the Ocala National Forest on Lake Kerr, an ideal site for the inward journey of spirituality and conscious awareness.

Seva is a yoga practice that literally means selfless service. Through the various seva programs, The Amrit Yoga Institute offers training in the authentic spiritual teachings of yoga through the Integrative Amrit Methods developed by Gurudev. This is a rare opportunity to study directly from a world-renowned yoga master who is known as a pioneer in bringing the spiritual teachings of yoga from India to the West.

You will learn to return to the present moment where you are integrated and undivided, and what you say, do and feel are in alignment. Washing pots, answering phones, making videos, chopping vegetables and vacuuming rugs will take on new form. In the spirit of selfless service, every sheet folded can be a vehicle of transformation; every pot washed provides an opportunity to move closer to the Source of love by letting go of habituated conditions and judgments.

In addition to your studies with Gurudev, his disciples, and senior teachers, you will live among a community of thirty to forty staff and volunteers. Through the practice of seva, or selfless service, you will have the opportunity to apply your training and practice to work and interpersonal relationships.

Not only will you learn to apply a spiritual lifestyle in all that you do, you will learn a variety of practical skill sets as you rotate through our various departments of operation.</description>

We believe this to be our soul's mission on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/purani-valley/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/purani-valley/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Purani Valley is a community that began forming in the beautiful Matutu Valley in Minas Gerais, Brazil. It began to take root by a shared vision of creating a community where people can develop their own gifts from a base of love, creative expression, art, music, poetry, and self-development. 

With much attention to detail, the construction began over 15 years ago to create structures with recycled materials, beautiful gardens, and an overall atmosphere of serene practicality. The environment is such that one can cultivate his/her gifts and receive healing through yoga, massage, gestalt, ayurvedic, culinary arts, baking, candlemaking, papermaking, beekeeping, farming, herbalism, and aromatherapy.

Multidisciplinary healing programs are created to revive the body, engage the mind and uplift the spirit. The environment is designed to accommodate groups for workshops and to promote authentic and true connection to each individual through music, dance, poetry, yoga, philosophy and education.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22831&quot;&gt;The Nest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Some of us are here to deepen our relationship with the earth.  Some are looking to foster community rooted in love and interdependence.  And some of us are just happy to have some good people to live and share a home with.  Some things that members would consider a big part of their lives: rewilding, foraging, permaculture, music, anarchy, love, sharing, community, activism, herbal medicine, education, human ecology, alternative economics, celebration, food, and compost.  Some of us identify as queer and we're all queer friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-nest/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-nest/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We're a house of friends and beyond.  It's a house that was falling apart and a few of us bought together to take some solid steps towards living our dreams.  We've fixed most of it up and now we're a house of 6.  There's a tiny jungle of a yard, full of beautiful flowers and wildness.  Our incredibly cool neighbors have some land that they've offered us to grow food on in exchange for some of the bounty, so some of us do that.  

Our dreams as individuals are big and intertwine all over.  While we share this somewhat typical house nestled within the grip of civilization, most of us plan on a future of living with the land in the near or distant horizon.  We're not sure what this house means to the bigger picture but we're pretty sure it's important.

And so our community is &quot;Established&quot; in the sense that here we are, sharing this space together, but still &quot;Forming&quot; in that we don't totally know what the future holds for us.</description>

We have a sister church in Kampala, Uganda, which is engaged in similar work.

God is calling serious disciples from around the world to greater trust and greater fidelity to his Kingdom; we are privileged to be on the forefront of this movement.</description>

To educate residents, interns, guests, visitors and the public about organic agricultural practices, as well as animal husbandry, clerical and business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/white-buffalo-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/white-buffalo-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;White Buffalo Farm is the oldest organic farm in Colorado, with a 43-year legacy. Nearly 4000 fruit trees and 3 acres of vegetable cultivation combine with 3/4 of a mile of national river help make our 50-acre farm a unique and fulfilling experience.

White Buffalo Farm is one of Colorado's oldest organic farms and a virtual paradise of fruit trees nestled in the foothills of the West Elk Wilderness, yet is an easy bike ride to Paonia. The farm is traversed by the North Fork of the Gunnison River and two irrigation ditches.  The farm is USDA certified organic and its founders pioneers in the organics movement.

Established in 1974, the farm's founder has years of experience growing food and community. White Buffalo Farm is evolving with the times. We are ready to engage wonderful new trends in organics, slow food, sustainability, slow money and relocalization.

If you are would like to explore living on the farm, please consider coming to visit the farm.

The farm is home to thousands of fruit trees, several acres of vegetables and three high tunnel greenhouses.  We grow cherries, European and Asian plum, peaches, d'Anjou and Asian pears, and apples. We grow tomatoes, squash, greens and a wide variety of other herbs and vegetables for our CSA.  We also raise laying hens and guinea hens.  WBF sells wholesale to the Front Range, direct at Farmers Markets and thru our Community Supported Agriculture (CSA).

Our core values are strengthening organic family farms, growing food for others, eating holistically and locally, placing goodness before money, faith in Spirit/God/Universe, being kind to the earth and ourselves, living in gratitude, being service-oriented, honoring creativity and art, honoring equity, demonstrating tolerance.

Growing food is healing, rewarding and feels great!</description>

We are an Educator's Kibbutz, meaning that our main focus and mission is achieving social change through education. Most members study education and work with youth and children in different educational frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kibbutz-shoshana-rose/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kibbutz-shoshana-rose/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are an &quot;Urban Kibbutz&quot;, i.e. a Socialist intentional community that lives in urban center and have a shared economy, mutual goals and missions, community life and events, etc.
Our Kibbutz numbers 40+ members from ages 25-27, and is located at the central city Rishon Le Ziyon in Israel. We live in the same neighborhood in roughly 10 different apartments that we rent. We have a fully shared economy (all income goes to the same bank account) and we manage our expenses together through conversations and consensus. 
We are part of a larger movement called &quot;Kvutzot Habhira&quot; (&quot;The Choosing Groups&quot;), which is a movement of alumni of the socialist youth movement &quot;Hamahanot Haolim&quot;.</description>

The world is on fire, and at any given time another  &quot;Arch Duke Ferdinand&quot; moment could occur causing us to spiral into extreme chaos. This is not a doomsday prepper group. I/WE are not concerned about the coming calamity that is inevitable and unavoidable. Our concern is what happens next. I am not here to spread a message of how to survive the apocalypse, I am here to spread a blueprint for the survivors of the coming catastrophe. It is imperative to reestablish society within the community of life and not as its enemy. Society has truly been at war with Mother Nature, God, our Fellow Man and this must not be allowed to occur when the time comes.
This will be an off-grid, heavily defensible, multi-faceted survival experience. We are in a forested location and I'm looking for forming members to plan development immediately.</description>

      <name>Odiyan Retreat Center</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22840&quot;&gt;Odiyan Retreat Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The mission of the Odiyan Retreat Center is twofold: 1) To assist in the protection, preservation and flourishing of all Buddhist cultures in Asia; and 2) To model as a living experiment the integration of Buddhist principles and Western thought through a live/work lifestyle dedicated to the benefit of our planet and all humanity.

The focus is on using work as an effective spiritual exercise, a practice in mindfulness and the means of perfecting six spiritual qualities, from generosity to discipline and patience, foundation of vigor, concentration, and wisdom. This basic training is called Skillful Means and is based on a book of the same name written by Odiyan founder Tarthang Tulku Rinpoche.  Rinpoche introduced Skillful Means as a way to help readers find greater satisfaction in work and life.

Classes and study opportunities available for all residents in Tibetan yoga, Skilfull Means, classical Tibetan language and other aspects of spiritual community life. 

Resident volunteers who stay on beyond six months also have optional opportunities for engaging in community activities such as daily early morning meditation and other practices of the Buddhist tradition. 

Skillful Means points out how the discipline of work develops awareness, strengthens concentration, and stimulates energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/odiyan-retreat-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/odiyan-retreat-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Odiyan is an all-volunteer non-profit Retreat Center dedicated to meaningful work, wholesome living and the inner development of mind and spirit.

The Odiyan way of life integrates creative and challenging work with a path of self-exploration that opens up your inner potential.  Odiyan’s dual mission is preserving the Buddhist cultures of Asia and modeling a living experiment integrating Buddhist principles and Western thought for the benefit of our planet and all of humanity.

Odiyan was founded in 1975 by Tibetan Buddhist Lama Tarthang Tulku. For over 40 years, volunteers from all over the world have been coming to Odiyan for six months or more to develop their own potential and contribute to the unique and holistic vision of enlightened knowledge for the benefit of all.

Odiyan Retreat Center sits on 1,000 acres overlooking the Pacific Ocean in northern California about 100 miles north of San Francisco. About 150 acres are managed landscape including seven orchards, four vegetable gardens, ornamental gardens surrounding the Temples, ponds, forests and open land.

As a resident at Odiyan, you will learn new skills, engage your mind and replenish your spirit in a wholesome, beautiful environment where accomplishment and learning about yourself go hand-in-hand. 

Living and working at Odiyan includes classes about Buddhism, a wide variety of work and sacred arts, vegetarian meals and a living allowance ($150 per month).

The minimum commitment to volunteer is six months.</description>

Property where village is forming is an active camp site for us. We have an established coffee orchard to provide a limited joint income. We are actively building cob homes. We want to have about 16 people, that may vary if we incorporate breeding or adoptive human folk.  Diversity is more than welcome: race, gender, oreintation, gender identity absolutely NOT an issue...it may work in your favor! We are attempting to practice several principles: permaculture, primitivism, sustainability and true communal principals, including polyamory if that suits your mindset. Right now, it is best if you have savings or a portable income. It does not cost much to live here.  $200 per month is more than enough to stay fed, clothed, and nurtured. We have a home in a small town nearby that we can retreat too when the jungle work becomes overwhelming. The home is BASIC. 2 bedrooms, a bathroom, a semi-shower....no hot water. But shelter and respite from jungle if needed. It is one block from the store that sells all the basic things you need. Very few people speak English...speaking Spanish is a definite advantage. It's not France, locals don't look down on you for not speaking their language, but it's hard to negotiate simple things i you don't speak the language. Currently we do not have a vehicle. The hike to the property is only 1.5 miles. The next town over, Las Varas, is about 20 minutes by car. Ocean is just about 10 miles.</description>

To become part of something greater than ourselves, and enjoy all the benefits that come with these new freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-hive-mind/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-hive-mind/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Hive Mind will be community based on my unconventional belief system. We will see ourselves as a singular entity separate from, yet encapsulated within society unfairly. We will live functionally using the organizational structure of our member-designed rituals and laws. We are not Capitalists, not Communists, not Socialists ... we are an independent form of Separatism. I coined the term &quot;Pagan Separatism,&quot; because the word Pagan really just means unconventional religion. As founder I am a Guru of the this undertaking. Our home will be the Hive and &quot;we&quot; are the Mind. I ask for a strong commitment to the teachings and the lifestyle.</description>

Who I am
Greetings, my name is Dustin and I am 29 years of age. I'm currently a lifelong resident of central North Carolina. I grew up without being taught many of the things a man needs to succeed in life, and from an early age I took an interest in things like economics and finance, investments, technology, animals and philosophy (as well as a fair bit of videogaming!) I was always very interested in being self sufficient, and at an early age I began to explore these interests with the support of my grandparents. I ordered 100+ chicks from Mcmurray Hatchery and learned Chickens the hard way and had a blast doing it. I grew up comfortable with tools and with working with my hands to solve problems thanks to my grandfather, his wood shop, and his career as a master wood craftsman and furniture maker. While I sadly didn't pick up the finer points of making beautiful things, I did learn much. As I grew older and moved into the world of business and entrepreneur ism I always felt something was lacking in my life. It seemed everything was about tomorrow. Putting off today’s pleasure for tomorrows gain became second hand to me and I became very good at resisting the temptation to go and do or buy the things I wanted. Instead I built up a sizable real estate portfolio and retired at 27. FINALLY I get to do what I want! Turns out, that wasn't meant to be and my portfolio was lost due to criminal activity by my mentor and managing partner. After soul searching last winter I realized that If I wanted to truly find happiness, I needed to be happy with where I was and not just with where I was heading. I needed to surround myself with good quality people of virtue and character for companionship. I needed to have land in order to continue enjoying the little back yard projects I tend to throw myself into. I needed a way to create a living from this land and the freedom to build as I chose. After spending the year researching various ecovillages, co-housing, intentional communities, and the like. Galt's Retreat was born.

Who we are

Galt's Retreat, named for the famous John Galt (I won't spoil it) is a philosophical manifestation of this dream. For now it only exists in my head and in the facebook group of the same name. (Update: It has BEGUN!) A number of potentially like-minded individuals who seek freedom and virtue and simple good living among good people have gravitated towards this group. We currently are in research mode(Update: We live on property now and others are transitioning) as we seek out the right piece of land and discuss our options for going into this project together. As of 12/1/16 we are networking actively and welcome all with interest in Homesteading, Ecovillages, intentional communities, etc.

What we are doing
We plan on buying raw unimproved land, preferably via splitting up larger parcels for greater savings, and building out our own ecovillage, including homes, powergrid, and for those interested - farmsteading. I've visited The Farm in TN and Earthaven in NC and drawn inspiration and potential, and want to incorporate sustainable permaculture design into our lives. Allowing us to live in proximity to nature, and in communion with it. 

Why we are doing it

I don't have to tell you there is something wrong with our culture. A large part of this push for an intentional community is cultural. We seek a place of peace and solitude and respect that is in short supply in mainstream culture and in the cities. For myself, this is as much a spiritual undertaking as health or business undertaking. But there are so many wonderful financial aspects to this that should not be ignored. There are even more health benefits to this lifestyle.

Pros and Cons

Imagine, just for a moment, that you could own a home, without borrowing money and without paying interest on that money for 30+ years. Imagine what kind of difference that could make in your life? As a primary benefit, our 'way of living' will be much less expensive than a typical lifestyle. We intend to build our own homes (Many of us already have experience in building or construction, electrical, plumbing, etc) using the best technology and technique of the modern age. I personally intend to use Compressed Earthen Block technology and build my home to last (I build things to last) Further benefits become synergistic and compounded when you consider the additional savings in reduced repair and maintenance costs, reduced energy waste, as well as the potential to easily learn to grow much of your own food supply (or even produce an income from your abundance!) 

This is truly a lifestyle, not just a move. There are so many ways to improve this that I haven't even begun to explore them all. 

There will be negative aspects. Rural living is slower, and while we fully intend to be close to civilization and employment opportunities, we will be living in a semi rural area, with space, privacy, and quiet more often then not. There may not be a starbucks on every corner - but the people will be friendlier. I encourage you to really consider the pros and cons of a rural ecovillage lifestyle in full before making any commitments.
----------------------------------------------
Breakdown

This is a call to those virtuous people out there who seek a life of win-win. Not win-lose. For those who desire to live a life that heals, not kills. For those who want to raise a family holistically rather than chemically. For those who wish to produce, not just consume. For those world-weary souls who have never felt at home in the modern world, and longed for the days of simple village living (Without giving up your internet or technology!)

For you, brothers and sisters, I made this video.

Bought land with other Voluntaryists (moved here, others haven't made the move yet!) Began building first structure, cutting walking paths, laying out plans for expansion pending additional help and bodies.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22852&quot;&gt;The Barnyard Homestead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to live independently, but with community values and support on a Godly foundation.  We are not opposed to worldly comforts, but we do believe that hard work, trust and honesty are core values that have been lost on many.  Our goals are to build a sustainable micro farm and ranch that can cover all the living, building and property expenses of the farm.  Every family will have joint ownership in the land and community buildings and have responsibilities on the farm. This farm will not be an attempt to seclude its members from the world but a place for some to fit into it in a way we understand. Jobs will be necessary for a time along with many other things. But in the end our mission is to create life long relationships with other families of like minds and develop a fully functional micro farm that sustains its members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-barnyard-homestead/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-barnyard-homestead/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are seeking to develop four homes with young families built ans sustained by our members along with a fully functional farm center on the goal of self sustainability and individual living.  Co-housing seems to be the best definition we are working to develop. In 2020 we would like to buy our-right or put a down payment on 20 acres in the beautiful Flathead Valley of norther Montana where we live and jointly own and build it with three other families.  The property will house each family a horse stable, pasture, both an animal and hay barn, a large garden space for community and market gardening, a large chicken coop and a few other buildings.  Expenses can come from the farm and or outside work we are not opposed to modern convinces.  The biggest reason we would like to see this collaboration develop is because we personal know how hard it is to grow a family in this day and age.  Our economy is failing many of us and if you dream on owning your own home and living on an active and working farm this is the alternative way without inheriting or having hundreds or thousands of dollars to buy it. We are looking for the young struggling couples that wish to have a family, grow in the lord, home school there children and have community with neighbors that they can trust and rely on. We are one family of four. My wife and I and our two children. We want our children to grow old with life long friends that are not molded to society and the worlds way of life and belief. We hunt and fish for food, gather firewood for our homes and additional income and work hard to maintain strong connection with grounded living and moral principals. Our farm will consist of horses, cows, goats, chickens, ducks rabbits, dogs, cats, pigs and most likely other animals that will come along the way. As this is a developing opportunity there is room for your say and in the next few years we hope that we find and get to know the family's we wish to development life long friendships with. Contact us and learn so much more.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22853&quot;&gt;Country Gardens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; ““We are a rural eco-village community, cultivating supportive relationships with each other, the larger community, and the Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/country-gardens/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/country-gardens/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are at the early stages of forming.  We are seeking like-minded, respectful, community-oriented, organically oriented gardening, permaculture, self-sufficiency, peace-loving co-founders to join with us in designing and establishing the village. 

We envision creating a rural eco-village community, cultivating supportive relationships with each other, the larger surrounding community, and the Earth.

We have strong Environmentalist Values—potential new members must be comfortable with the expectation that this is an environmentalist community.  Prefer members to be of a permaculture and organic mindset; for both gardening and farming animals.

Location
Our 95-acres of land are located in north central Oklahoma, which is in the center of the U.S. and part of the “Great Plains.” Our 95 acres is heavily forested in places and has some open pasture and farmland as well. We are 3 miles from a small town population 1,100, and about 50 miles west of Tulsa, OK. 

We already have a great deal that we do on our land, practices we have followed, and projects completed and in the works.  We are open to the community validating or changing these as the group determines:
1. Permaculture principles such as Hugelkultur, deep mulching, terracing with swales and berms; and rainwater capture
2. Energy independence using solar, wind, water capture, and earthship greenhouse
3. Peace-loving, open-minded lifestyle
4. Organically certified gardening
5. Ranching, dairy goats for milk, cheese, yogurt and Kefir production
6. Poultry for eggs and meat production, as well as for pest reduction;
7. Wildcrafting/Foraging for greens, mushrooms, fruit, herbs, soapberries, etc.
8. Agricultural land use for potential produce sales income through the Oklahoma Food Cooperative (www.oklahomafood.coop) and/or a nearby Farmer’s Market.
9. Hunting in an excellent white-tailed deer habitat with limited bow-hunting for shared meat acquisition
10. Cob-Straw-bale building (in process) for multi-purpose community use, such as for meetings, a loft for WWOOFers, group music making and drumming, and health food store inventory and retail sales.
11. Cob-Rocket Oven and Shelter (in process) for outdoor community cooking use
12. Greenhouse (Earthship design, under construction) for seed-starting and winter greens production.

Some of our core values, principles we would like to ascribe to, are listed below.

1. A Multi-generational approach to living and sharing labor and knowledge
2. Peace-loving attitudes with open-mindedness as a fundamental value
3. Tool and equipment sharing, for community projects
4. Egalitarian, Income-Sharing optional on communal farm enterprises (such as health food business, farm store, or organic produce sales)
5. Energy and self-sufficient lifestyle, (within reason--not from a paranoid viewpoint)
6. Communally engaged (while still respecting everyone's right to privacy)
7. Environmentally focused (respect and care for surrounding environment and the Earth as a whole)

What we prefer to avoid:
•Gun use other than for food acquisition
•Extremist viewpoints
•Using large farm equipment

When contacting us please include:
•What about Country Gardens interests you and what are your intentions for being here?
•What does living in an eco-community mean to you?
•What assets will you bring to the community?
•What is your background so far?
•What is your full legal name, address, birthday, and government form of identification?
•If anything stated above concerns you, but you are still interested in being a part of our community, please let us know what your concern is and we can speak further with you in that regard.

We will go deep into the Amazon jungle and survive in the wild.
For about one year, we will learn how to survive in the jungle, how to look for food and hunt, drink pure water from vines and rivers, make wood rafts, make rainproof temporary huts, learn about the medicinal plants and how to treat wounds, etc.
After the training phase comes to an end, we will dive into the jungle and live there for one year. 

Maximum age 33.
You have to be fit physically, or have the intention to be fit, we will train together for around one year before entering the deep jungle.

I know this sounds wild; it is. Thats the point.
The idea is to surround ourselves with pure nature and experience life in its purest form, pre-civilization.</description>

We have 3 greenhouses, a fruit and vegetable growing field, goats, ducks, chickens, a shop, a few dwellings, fruit trees, and a farm stand.  We also already have a few cats and dogs and will not be accepting any more. We are very open-minded and would love to have people passionate about permaculture and more natural ways of living. In the past we had a lot of fun but got sidetracked when venturing into beer- and wine-making and problems ensued, so lesson learned, we are working to get back on track to our original vision and will not be accepting people with any drug or alcohol problems. We still plan on having fun but hopefully with music, food, and dance minus the drunken shenanigans. At the moment the property is not very child-friendly, but with the right kind of folks and property cleanup, that will hopefully change.  We have lots of stuff for the creative person to mess around with. This year we would like to work on soil remediation and nut trees and redesigning our planting field in line with permaculture principles. Next year we would like to be able to have enough produce to sell at the local farmers market. We are not certified organic nor do we intend to be, but we do practice organic methods.</description>

Right now we are traveling across the US, looking at some communities we are interested in joining. Below is our vision for the ideal community. We still welcome email inquiries from folks who resonate with our vision!****

Our goal is to build or join an intentional community of families working towards ecological and social sustainability. The clear place to start is through finding like-minded, like-hearted individuals with whom we can embark on this journey.

I hope that in sharing my vision, our family will either find an established community of families interested in our joining as potential members, or that we’ll find a group of families interested in embarking on the journey of creating an intentional community together.

ABOUT US:

We are a family of five humans. Joey is in his mid-thirties and I am in my mid-twenties. We have three children together – Peacy is 5, born in March 2011. Micah is 3, born in December 2012, and Ahmik is 6 months old, born last January. We currently live in northern New Mexico on a small and anything-but-sustainable homestead. We tend goats, chickens, rabbits, honeybees and a garden. We have a dog who lives with us, and three cats who live in our outbuildings, keeping the mice at bay. We have lived in a number of other places over the past few years as well – New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut … and some other temporary spots along the way. 

I am a natural childbirth (freebirth) advocate, a gardener, herbalist, baker… I love to work with my hands – to create beautiful things. I built a cob oven last summer, and it has taken a huge place in my heart – stoking the fire, kneading the bread, forming the loaves and letting them rise … and baking, and then finally eating them and feeling all that love made tangible. I have a newfound love for sourdough. I have a strong desire to become a master grower of brambles … to learn how to cultivate the BEST black raspberries ever … because what could be better than raspberries?? I am also incredibly in love with waterfalls, thunderstorms … stones, mountains, willows … moss, ferns, motherwort, yarrow, mint, roses … . I am learning how to be the best mother I can be – to be mindful and deliberate in my relationship with my children. This is my greatest challenge, but the process is so rewarding when I commit myself to it fully, and looking back, I can see in the last five years how I have made enormous progress in my ability to be a gentle, compassionate parent.

Peacy is in love with flowers. She has big questions for a five-year-old, like “where does water come from?” “How are rocks made?” “Do crabs breathe air or water?” Sometimes I know how to answer her questions but usually we just contemplate them together… . She gets me thinking and I really love getting deep into things with her. She is very guarded around people she does not know, too. Micah is a very gentle soul … very internal, but really fun to be with. He likes to watch little creatures, like beetles and ants and bees, and to talk about them. He loves to share his joy. He also has a mischievous streak, and he loves the moon. Ahmik is so sweet, so open and bright and excited to be with others. She has an amazing smile, and a beautiful laugh. I can’t wait to see what she will be like when she is older. 

LAND:

I know that the land I choose to inhabit will ultimately shape my life to a greater extent than any other factor. So in that respect, there are a few aspects which I consider essential in determining where to live. 

Firstly, nearby access to clean freshwater is essential. That could take the form of lakes, ponds, rivers, or year-round streams. (Ideally, they would be strong and consistent enough to support human use for washing, drinking and watering gardens in dry times. I would rather not rely solely on well-water for these purposes, although living with the right people is more important to me, so I would compromise on my desire to use surface water for our needs in exchange for the right community. I would also love to implement good, simple rainwater catchment systems for these purposes.)

Secondly, the land would need to be fertile enough to easily support permaculture gardens, fruit trees, chickens and annual crops such as potatoes, carrots, beets, garlic, onions and greens. This would be taking into account composting of human manure to re-fertilize growing spaces.

Thirdly, the land would need to be part of or somewhat near to wild, undeveloped places, with ecosystems strong and abundant enough to support sustainable, ethical hunting and/or fishing for meat and foraging for wild foods. 

There are other aspects of the land which aren’t by any means essential but which would provide an advantage that I’d consider either important or just simply ‘nice.’ Obviously they are not all compatible with each other, and obviously a community/tribe could thrive without any of these, so this is why I don’t list them as essential. These include lush pasture for rotational grazing of domesticated farm animals, salmon streams, a long growing season, abundant sugar maples, and ocean or a large body of water within walking distance.

COMMUNITY VISION: 

My ideal for a community is one in which the members make a commitment to live and work together, with a common vision and with common values. 

A commitment to being together is essential. One of the main reasons for my dislike of the nuclear family model is that each family is working towards a separate goal of sustenance, making time spent together outside of the nuclear family rare. When we all have separate houses with separate meals to make, separate dishes to do, separate children to raise, separate gardens to tend, separate money to be made … where does that leave time to be together? If meals are usually shared, that means meal preparation and cleanup can be communal – and it means cooking and dishes can be more fun. If we raise our children together, we can share the responsibilities in ways that make sense for us and our children. If we work and build and grow food together, that can be more fun and more productive, too. Many hands make light work.

The vision of living together does not necessarily mean many families sharing one home, although it could easily take that form and work beautifully. It could mean many small, simple dwellings centered around a larger common space, where food is usually prepared and eaten communally in the common space … this seems to be the model in many traditional tribal cultures.

Making food central to community seems very important – food is central to our well-being, and with a shared vision of growing, raising and gathering our food communally – working together to nourish each other – it seems inevitable that we will see that we are all crucial to each other’s well-being. Because of this, in order to fully share meals, some overlap in dietary preferences seems necessary. It also seems like diet should be based on what the land can provide. It would be difficult to support a group of vegans in the arctic, for example.

Emotional maturity and making communication a priority, even in times of conflict and difficulty, seems essential in community. Meeting many different needs simultaneously can be difficult, and conflict is inevitable – it should be planned for. If we can listen to each other with respect and speak honestly and directly when we need to express something, conflict resolution can be graceful. Without a commitment to everyday openness and vulnerability, the natural flow of emotions will be blocked and tension will inevitably build. So it seems crucial that all involved in a community are ready to articulate their needs, feelings, worries, etc., and at the same time be willing to really make the time and space to listen to others when they need to speak. It also seems necessary to give each other emotional space, with forgiveness and understanding that we are all on our own path of self-discovery, and mistakes in how we communicate are possible, not cause for creating more distance between each other, but simply cause for further, deeper communication. Nonviolent communication could be a very helpful tool. 

My philosophy on being with children also holds a big space in my vision for community. They need respect and cooperation on the part of adults in the same way that we need respect and cooperation from them. If they are to grow into healthy community members, they need to be treated respectfully as human beings, and not as property. I want a children’s culture – a place where children are free to discover the world around themselves together through their play and exploration, or to join in with the tasks and projects of adults if they are interested. Respect for our children’s choices and their organic learning process is so important to me. Forcing children to comply with school, or even forced compliance with simple things like cleaning up, does not resonate with me. Naomi Aldort is an inspiration for me in this regard. Radical unschooling is an inspiration as well – not that school is inherently bad, but that the choice to attend school should be the child’s. All that being said, boundaries seem very necessary, as adults have needs too. It also seems necessary to have some parameters around children’s relationships with each other, specifically in terms of their conflict resolution – it seems only fair to guide their conflict resolution in a nonviolent way if a child is resorting to violence. Otherwise, it seems best to be aware but out of the way unless asked for. Respect for children starts in infancy – honoring their requests for closeness, comfort, and care through co-sleeping, breastfeeding on demand, etc., and through to their transition to adulthood by honoring their choices, as long as their choices do not interfere with the sovereignty/well-being of other humans. Through a balance of respect for our children’s choices and a commitment to vocalizing our own parental needs and requests, my hope is that a healthy parent-child dynamic will ensue, leading to greater respect and freedom for all.

Shared or communal childcare is also something that’s important to me, and something I am looking for in community.

Love for the earth and a commitment to working towards true sustainability is also so important. If we took the time to look at every facet of life to see if there is a simpler more gentle approach, we could greatly reduce dependence on industrially-produced tools and appliances. Minimal use of modern technology would be my ideal, obviously including electricity and gas, but with an open mind and a willingness to take an even deeper look at more simple technology to see if it actually improves quality of life or not, and if it does, what is the environmental impact of that technology and is it worth the trade-off? This would include prioritizing simplicity through natural building, simple tools for gardening, simple tools for cooking/food storage/food preservation, etc.

Another aspect of a tribe which I crave, but which would not necessarily be essential for me, is the regular sharing of celebrations. I am drawn towards pagan traditions in this regard, and would love to communally celebrate full moons, solstices and equinoxes, seasons, birthdays, weddings, coming-of-age, funerals… all of it. I feel like intentional celebration has the potential to greatly improve the health of a community!

The issue of meat is also one that I feel would play a role in community. Our family is omnivorous. We would strive to eventually raise or harvest all of our own meat, whether through ethical hunting and trapping, fishing, or pasture-raising farm animals, which would mean that a good deal of time each season would be dedicated to projects related to meat – slaughtering, butchering, preserving, hide tanning… etc. Animals do have many more similarities to humans than carrots or potatoes, which makes it easier for us to empathize with them. But carrots and potatoes are living beings too, with an incredible intelligence of their own. In order for life to be sustained, it needs to feed on life, and although taking the life of an animal can be devastatingly sad, our truth is that it is part of the natural cycle. So, we are not vegetarians, but we would not object to living with vegetarians.

How we deal with illness and healing might play a role in community life, and although I would be glad to live with humans with different philosophies on healthcare, I’d like to share my thoughts and personal philosophies in case they would cause conflict. I would prefer to, whenever necessary, have trust in my body’s immune system and ability to heal on its own. Susun Weed’s “six steps of healing” is an inspiration, as she starts out this way too – most of the time illness is caused by a physical or emotional imbalance that can be corrected through simple lifestyle changes or through emotional acceptance and release. If necessary, herbs can be a great ally. I would prefer to eventually grow and wild-gather herbs and tincture them, dry them, etc. to make an herbal pharmacy, with an emphasis of plants native to the region that I choose to call home, so as to be health-care self-sufficient. I have little or no interest in modern medicine, but I do have some interest in traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, and various healing modalities of native tribal people around the world.

The founders of this project are an alternative family consisting of one man and two women with four children. 
We home-educate our children. 
We raise our own fruits, vegetables, and animals. 
We believe in equality, not conditionally so (on a hot day, if a man can take his shirt off while farming, so can a woman, for example). 
We believe in a strong focus on healthy practices, ranging from growing our own food to self-care like daily fitness, yoga, weekly massage, etc.
We believe in continual growth through learning and spirituality. We are not &quot;religious,&quot; but we are spiritual and all the adults currently in this community are survivors of abuse who have broken the cycle and grown as people. 
We believe that &quot;many hands make light work&quot; and that people can learn from each other and grow together, living in peace with each other, nature, and balance. There is no need for &quot;over-consumption&quot; &quot;social status,&quot; etc.</description>

In, through &amp;amp; around the Kindergarten we plan to foster/engage a community, age-spanning from young children to aged-adults, interested in changing paradigms towards regenerative lifestyles, spiritually, culturally and ecologically, all the while developing voices strong in roots and eloquent in delivery. 

Language is a vital part of our model and community. We welcome polyglots especially with inclinations toward native and indigenous tongues &amp;amp; dialects 

Our set date for opening is Sep 15th, 2017. 

As a starting point, we hope to have a multi-purpose space that can adequately host:

1.	Culturally rich events such as:
             a) 	Story-Night Gatherings. 
             b) 	Theatrical Presentations
             c)	 Musical Performances
2.	Reading/Writing groups
3.	Craft Workshops
4.     Dream Nights

Additionally, we hope the studio space is fit to practice:

4.	Community Gardening
5.	Livestock Farming
6.     Shared art projects and exhibitions

We are very much looking forward to others joining this collective, be it for an event, a weekend for a longer-term stay. 

Drop us a line if you are in or coming through the area.

We are a community of people living in a mobile home park in New Lebanon. We have a wide variety of residents, some who have lived in the park since it was first built almost 70 years ago. 

We are hoping to build a stronger community within the park. Everyone owns their own home and is a permanent resident. In the past, the park owners have not fostered a strong sense of trust and community in the park. We are trying to change that. 

There is a large lawn for planting gardens, quiet and peaceful location, and a small town with plenty of opportunity for entrepreneurial minds. 

If you are interested in living here, please get in touch! It's the least expensive way that I know of to own your own home in a great community of people.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22865&quot;&gt;Muddy Creek Satyagraha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Muddy Creek Satyagraha is a network of people dedicated to living the ethical life free from the global economy, in an atmosphere optimal for natural living and nonviolent thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/muddy-creek-satyagraha/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/muddy-creek-satyagraha/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&quot;You cannot build nonviolence on a factory civilization, but it can be built on self-contained villages. Rural economy as I have conceived it eschews exploitation altogether, and exploitation is the essence of violence. You have therefore to be rural-minded before you can be nonviolent, and to be rural-minded you have to have faith in the spinning wheel.&quot; 
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi

Muddy Creek Satyagraha is a founding nomadic community living and travel along a foot path, interconnecting nature, food sources and intentional communities. The path, known as the peace trail, avoids roads and development traversing the Luckiamute, Muddy Creek, Alsea and Siualaw watersheds in the Central Willamatte Valley and Coast Range Mountains of Western Oregon with possibilities of spanning from the cascades to the coast and much further.

Satyagraha was a Sanskrit word created by Gandhi to engender his movement with one of the least understood yet most active forces in the universe, ahimsa, or nonviolence. &quot;Satya&quot; can mean truth and &quot;graha&quot; incites firmness or grasping. So satyagraha is the energy of nonviolence and can be translated as truth force or soul force.

Life on the peace trail is supported by what can be termed the &quot;true gift economy,&quot; or &quot;moment by moment true giving and receiving.&quot; This means we relinquish the privilege of payment, trade, barter, and expense, and instead enjoy giving in a voluntary way, giving without expectation of payback and with no relationship to previous receiving. Conversely through our Muddy Creek Satyagraha Nomadic Souperfood Soup Kitchen and through our own receiving of it's palio and phytonutrient rich superfoods, everyone's needs are addressed without correlation to past or future giving, living as our ancestors did before the loss of the tribal and extended family systems, and the communal cooking pot, and the cradle to grave social security that came with it, in exchange for a system that puts food under lock and key.  Our practice of the gift economy directly reverses this historic trend. 

The ecovillages along the peace trail are diverse and unique to each other but have in common three traits traditionally considered requisites for a nonviolent society. First that people are on the land together, second that they turn to nature, or ethnobotany, to some degree, as opposed to strictly purchasing and costs of life, and third that there is a desire that everybody's needs be met.

Traversing the peace trail can be described as a meditation or prayer-walk or pilgrimage. The trail is designed to support barefoot walking and living without a pack, so with silent, steady, weightless striding the upper body is effortlessly suspended and as the sacred landscape goes by at ancient foot speed the journey enters into a kind of extended meditation. The trail connects places of spiritual interest as we walk between two small zen temples, two inipis (sweat lodges), a Kalapuya earth mound and many traditional and beautiful natural places.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22867&quot;&gt;Second Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We have a bold vision: The earth will enter into a new age where human beings will grow up to a higher level of consciousness and create a brand-new social system. Based on universal values, the earth will become a harmonious planet with diverse cultures blossoming everywhere.

A. New Social System: Create an International Big Family
B. Ecovillage life: Possess nothing but own everything

The Ecovllage People will travel freely without border limitations and prefer living the ecovillage life as opposed to traditional lifestyles. There is only one global government, which is managed by saints and sages who no longer think of private profits and possessions.

Meanwhile, people's consciousnesses will grow up, the best qualities of mankind, like sincerity, beauty, kindness, love, faith, diligence, and honesty will be stimulated through collective life, and the weeds in people’s soul gardens, such as selfishness, greed, jealousy, complaining, and laziness will fade away.  Everyone will have and enjoy a harmonious, civilized, happy, and free life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/second-home/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/second-home/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Second Home was established in 2009 in Yunnan, China, by a group of people who held common universal values and the vision of creating a new life mode for human beings to sustain themselves on earth. Yunnan is a region that offers the best weather and rich natural resources in China. We set up three branches and the community members rose from the original 20, up to 180, including 20 older members and 14 children.

Second Home founder, Xue Feng, initiated this project in April 2009. Xue Feng is the spiritual guide of the Second Home, who wrote Chanyuan corpus and Xuefeng corpus since 2001, and have established a theory system on universe, life, LIFE, time and space, human beings, mind, consciousness and energy with over 8,000,000 words. This system combines the essence wisdom and teachings of Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Muhammed, and those of saints and sages from different cultures all over the world. It is a universal-values system beyond races, nationality, culture and religions.

New Universal Values
(It took 15 years to build the theoretical system, still in the process of updating and upgrading)

In our community, we have a harmonious relationship between people and nature. Everyone enjoys a simple and happy life here, the instances of crimes and fights are zero. Arguments, quarrels, and conflicts are very rare.

This is because of the solid basis of the universal values we had built before the community was established. It was initiated and written by the founder, Xuefeng, and since 2001, he has written more than 2500 articles with over 10 million words in Chinese. Before participating in setting up the community, all members are first resonating with the values, including the dream of creating a sustainable new life mode beyond the limits of countries, nationalities, religions, and races; and bringing people real happy, free, joyful, and blessed lives.

So this values system and the common dream are the deep roots and energy source that motivates all members of the Second Home under all circumstances.

The content includes the origin of the universe, the origin of LIFE and human beings, the crises human beings are faced with, the meaning and purpose of life, the nature of countries, political parties, religions, and marriage and family; the consciousness, spirit, thinking, structure, and energy of the non-material world, and the way of perfecting human nature, etc. It absorbs the wonderful wisdoms of human history such as those of Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Muhammad, and all wisdom essences of sages and saints from different civilizations and cultures.</description>

We are a family. We allow the Spirit to guide what we do, not in any dogmatic way, but in a real, open-ended sense. We are setting an example for creating reality patterns that are based on pure forms of consciousness, shared understanding, and spontaneous wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-birdseye-creek-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-birdseye-creek-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hi everyone, this is Will MacBride, founder of the Birdseye Creek Community. We are based on some great woodland property I own (just recently bought) in Gold Hill, Oregon. I checked the box &quot;forming&quot; there because we are a faily new community. However we're definitely up and running and getting more established each day. This is definitely a great &quot;ground floor&quot; opportunity as far as intentional communities go. 

This community is based on love, togetherness, leaving behind old neurotic patterns, and gradually awakening to the wonderful and fun possibilities that are all around us. This is a place where people can unfold in community with others and begin to explore new potentials in themselves and in reality. It's a place to be creative on many levels.

We value spontaneity and allowing &quot;The Spirit&quot; to guide what we do and essentially to solve problems. The quality of the consciousness here is such that the emphasis of forward looking creative energy gathers momentum and &quot;problems&quot; are worked out spontaneously and naturally as part of the entire progression.

As far as activities are concerned: We're into gardening, raising animals responsibly and humanely, natural building, music and art, and the formation of focused groups of various sorts.
 
6 people, 1 dog, and 1 cat live in and around an old ramshackle mobile home on the property. We will soon be building other structures, and are offering people the opportunity to camp for very affordable rent ($200 per month basic rate, somewhat negotiable based on someone's financial situation). There is an attached shop space that is excellent for various types of work.

This is a great place for artists and musicians, people into gardening and permaculture, people into natural building, and people that consider themselves &quot;off grid&quot; in a creative and active sense.</description>

We have and want more companion animals, farm animals, and working animals.
We are working towards both self-sufficiency and survival, but are not survivalists or hard-core preppers.
We are non-judgmental and accepting of people of any gender, sexuality, ethnicity, spiritual belief, etc.
We are eco-friendly and trying to be good stewards to the land.
We employ permaculture and organic gardening practices.
We are left-leaning.

What we hope you are:
Not an extremist in anything including survivalism and religion.
Wanting to build a life for the long-term.
Any ages, genders, with or without kids.
Bringing something to the table.
Ready to work hard alongside us to create a self-sufficient home for all of us.

If this sounds like something you would be interested in, get in touch; we'd love to hear from you. We don't have room for anyone to move in or stay with us just yet; we're working on it. We'll probably find the rest of our community before we can get the structures we need  in place; we're in the very beginning stages of this.</description>

We want to make our everyday life have a positive impact on the world around us and future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/no-mans-land/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/no-mans-land/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We want to be more or less around 6 families living there full time where they can park a home on wheels or build a small dwelling with natural or up-cycled material.  

While this is going to be on the side of an anarchist community, keep in mind there will be certain rules that will need to be followed. While most of the 18-acre land will be communal space, there will also be shared tasks that each member must fulfill one way or another. 

Some tasks will include taking care of the gardens, the livestock and maintaining the guest cabins, yurts, tree houses, and tent placements which will play a role in the community as rental income. We also will have a MakerSpace with several art and fabrication workshops for us to use which will need to be kept clean and organized. We want this to be a place for everyone and be an affordable artist/traveler resort.

The land will be used for small festivals and fairs 3 times a year or so.  There is only 5 or 6 acres of the land that is flat and cleared so the festivals can only be so small due to the lack of parking. Anyway, this will be our home so we don't want anything big, just a good party once in a while!

Living in harmony with nature, creativity and self-sustainability while having fun is our goal.</description>

Blueprint's communities serve as demonstration communities for documenting the development process and costs. That information will be shared on an open-source platform for other developers to copy, use, revise, and improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/blueprint-geneva-downtown/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/blueprint-geneva-downtown/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This 14 townhouse community is centered around a 4000-sq. ft. community house in the middle of downtown Geneva, on the shore of Seneca Lake in the middle of the Finger Lakes Wine region. The community is currently accepting applicants and is open to residents of all ages, incomes, and interests.  

These 480-sq ft. to 960-sq.ft. homes are grid-connected but are completely self-sufficient for electricity, heat and water. They feature modern conveniences such as in-floor radiant heat, designer kitchens, vaulted ceilings, central AC, and maintenance-free exteriors.

The community has shared resources including a community lounge, kitchen, dining room, theatre, storage units, workshop, and guest rooms.  The community also will feature an electric-vehicle-sharing program.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22877&quot;&gt;Donald's View&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our Core Values:
• Diversity
• Bridging
• Consciousness
• Communication.

Consciousness is the base  of Diversity and Bridging. Bridging is built by consciousness and makes diversity sustainable. Communication sustains all three. 

We intend our community and our selves to be bridges. We bridge:
• within ourselves as consciously as possible accepting all our inner diversity and the greater self-unity and inner peace and joy this gives us, and the more joyful and peaceful energy that results in our relating to others.
• to each other as members of the Donald’s View intentional community by using the bottom-up, 100% democratic problem-solving methods of the Assemblies pioneered by Donald Anderson with the National Association of the Southern Poor.
• as a community, with
o our neighbors and society at large to move forward to a livable future.
o towns, counties and communities surrounding us geographically
o other intentional communities region-, nation-, and worldwide
• from the old, “taker” paradigm in which corporations have the same rights as individuals without the accountability to a new, planetary community of harmony paradigm which future inhabitants will view as an aesthetic and practical enhanced, including considerations for geological orientation, geological sustainability, and golden mean in construction
• from a calculated cost-benefit paradigm to an artisan paradigm where all acts are of beauty in spiritual alignment with a mutually respectful future
• from work that harms others as it sustains us to work that sustains others as it sustains us.
• from a problematic present to a peaceful future, to our better tomorrow as a multi-cultural community living to thrive with no ecological footprint with all our neighbors: humans, animals and plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/donalds-view/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/donalds-view/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Donald's View is a forming intentional community in rural southern Virginia. We are actively seeking passionate founding members who
1. read this description carefully;
2. read, and feel resonance with our Core Values: http://www.michaelbrickler.com/donaldsview/docs/DonViewVisState.pdf
3. are ready to invest in every way (including financially), in our development;
4. communicate with us to discuss next steps.

We feel no one should be turned away for financial reasons _and_ everyone in the community, plus allies and other donors, contributes financially. 

Origins of the Community
The Original Founding Member is Michael Brickler. The land has been connected with Michael's family since his ancestors were enslaved on the land. This intentional community is multicultural to honor the African and Native American heritage of the land. It is also a  bridge for the larger surrounding community to cross to a future where our region can live in a more conscious, democratic, sustainable and fulfilling way.
Our name comes from Michael's uncle Donald, who through his organizing work with the National Association of the Southern Poor was one of the main people who helped Michael develop this view of life and who was responsible for our family keeping this land which was a part of the plantation where my great-great-grandfather was born.  
Donald started a celebration of friends, family and neighbors that we have kept going for over 48 years called &quot;Usufruct.&quot; He explained Usufruct as &quot;honoring the fruit of the land without owning the land.&quot;  We want this idea of Usufruct to be part of our daily life at Donald's View.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22878&quot;&gt;Tui Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Today 30 – 40 adults and children live in a beautiful place by the sea, Wainui Bay, on the edge of the Abel Tasman National Park in New Zealand’s South Island. Among the many activities of the community, we grow an organic garden, organic orchard and share weekly communal meals. Families live in unique separate houses and people are responsible for the financing of their own accommodation. Some people work at Tui Balms cooperative and many have independent incomes and occupations. A main focus of community life is the building of genuine relationships based on honest and open communication.

The Tui Spiritual &amp;amp; Educational Trust is a charitable Trust dedicated to the general promotion and enhancement of community life.

The Trust gains much of its impetus from the working example of Tui Community and some of its objectives are realised by providing programs in which people may visit, experience and learn the workings of an intentional community.

The Tui Events Park is currently holding events catering to Tracks and Tides Rites of Passage Foundation, Permaculture, Men’s &amp;amp; Women’s Gatherings &amp;amp; Heart Shares, festivals and markets. These events are either coordinated or administered by Tui Trustees. They are open to public participation and focus broadly on the healing and enhancement of individuals, through their participation in the challenges and nurturing of community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/tui-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/tui-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Tui Community was founded in 1984 with the aim to create intentional community. The group purchased a farm consisting of 50 hectares (125 acres) in Wainui Bay. Over the years community people and processes have evolved.  Now it is a blend of an “intentional community” and a “village” where people deliberately come together to share lives in a way that reaches out beyond nuclear family living.</description>

I filled out some sketches of what interests me in terms of sharing a space together.  I believe in an active community of listeners and communication heavy environments.  Obviously there are times we all need/want to be alone... and finding that balance really depends on the people.  I would like to find a group of eight people/couples.</description>

​
We understand that our wellbeing as a community is directly connected to the kindness, compassion and respect we extend to nonhuman animals, humans and our natural environment, and we are dedicated to promoting a space of safety and comfort for all, here at Forever MicroRanch (FMR).
​
FMR's permanent resident farmed animals are an integral focus to our social justice work, with whom relational ways of being are explored and lived within a multi-species community.  As members of this community model, we are committed to pursuing and advocating for a path of least harm toward all nonhumans, humans and the environment, which includes continual cooperative discovery and incorporation of accessible, attainable strategies to live as compassionately and sustainably as possible.

Our organization is built upon the foundational framework of pro-intersectional veganism.  
If you feel you would like to grow with us, contact us at @ ForeverMicroRanch.com to discuss your plans.</description>

Our community nurtures residents' lives through daily social interaction, shared community responsibilities, spiritual expression, and a balance of communal and private living, in a physical environment of quality homes and extensive common facilities. The members of Berkeley Moshav are deeply inspired by Jewish values and openly express these values in the physical, social, and spiritual dimensions of our intentional community. We are an inclusive community that respects and values diversity in age, family composition, economic circumstance, and Jewish observance.

We intend to create a community of households that are both committed to Jewish life and diverse in Jewish observance. We recognize that this will require compromise and accept that we will all have to go a little beyond our comfort zones in order to create a truly inclusive and Jewishly diverse environment where those who practice and express Judaism differently can make community together.

We welcome equally Jews from all backgrounds as well as non-Jews who wish to live in such a space. (Examples of the latter would include non-Jewish spouses/partners and participants in Jewish life who are neither formally Jewish nor self-identified as Jewish.) We will be a community that honors, respects, appreciates, and values differences in Jewish observance and expression. Jewish practice within each household is entirely at the discretion of that household.</description>

We're interested in compassionate communication, community building, permaculture, eco-villages, sustainability, micro-farming, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/common-roots-co-op/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/common-roots-co-op/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are currently 2 adults with 2 children seeking like-minded individuals to create a co-housing community in the DC area. Currently we are focusing our search in the Prince George's County area, where currently no other IC's exist. The easily available and relatively affordable rural land, yet close proximity to the city make it a great option for people working in the city who want a communal, sustainable, slower pace of life within a reasonable commuting distance to Washington DC, Baltimore, and Annapolis.

We would love to find more individuals interested in getting in on the planning! We seek to create a diverse community and will not discriminate on the basis of age, gender, race or sexuality. We are flexible and diverse in our interests depending on the interests of the community. Personally we are interested in community building, gardening, sustainability, micro-farming and homesteading.

We are seeking democratic and and community-minded people who want to come together to care for the land and create community through various interests and shared spaces (like community gardens, jam nights, camp fires, potlucks, board game nights, etc.). We're looking for visionary and energetic people who want to join us in the planning stages and be a part of designing our mission and goals!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22884&quot;&gt;Earth Care Collaborative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We envision an eco-village based around the ideas of permaculture, transition towns, non-violent communication, bio-dynamics, unschooling, natural/non-toxic living, child-centered natural/gentle parenting, and voluntary simplicity.

Both Nikki and Scott have an interest in educational philosophy, mentoring, nature connection, and sustainable development. We have discussed starting an educational institute but think that will be a task for once the community is established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/earth-care-collaborative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/earth-care-collaborative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;My wife and I own 5 acres of land in the Sierra Nevada foothills which has a south-facing slope and irrigation water access. It currently has a yurt and a 30-foot fifth-wheel on it. We plan to add permanent buildings in the future. We also own 1/2 an acre about 50 minutes west of Portland, Oregon, that we would happily share.

So we are currently without a community. We just moved to Marysville from Oregon a few months ago for my wife's first teaching job. We want to live in an eco-village someday. We figured we would put it out there that we are open to the idea of our land being the site for an eco-village. We own the property without a mortgage. It has great potential, but Scott is limited in the amount of work he can accomplish essentially alone since we have two young toddlers that need attention.

If the site is not ideal there is the option to work as a team to improve the value of it so we can sell and get a better site. We are yet to look at the legal structure that would allow for us to do that while remaining in collective ownership.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22885&quot;&gt;The Genome Collective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To create a sustainable model for the local food system of Binghamton, NY, and to educate students, households and businesses about urban farming, food reclaiming practices, and sustainable cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-genome-collective/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-genome-collective/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Genome Collective lives in Binghamton, NY. We welcome people of all ages, backgrounds, and identities who are excited about working together to create a collective home based around food justice, anti-oppressive values, art, and an egalitarian community lifestyle.

Rent for each resident-member varies from $250 to $450 a month, depending on ability to pay, living accommodations, and capacity to contribute to money-saving, sustainable activities. Rent includes all food, utilities, and household supplies.

More About Who We Are:
The Genome Collective was established in February 2016. The community lives in a roomy three-story Victorian house, located at 65 Park Avenue on the South Side of Binghamton.

What We Do: 
We strive to create a communal space open to as many people as possible, while also maintaining a safe, comfortable, and relaxing space for all of our members.

We keep a very well-stocked communal kitchen, and maintain a 1500-square-foot mushroom farm in our basement. We also keep about a 1/4-acre vegetable garden outside. 

We have an unattached garage, which we use as a wood shop, music studio, and bike shop. Above the garage there is an open temple space where we host yoga and meditation classes.

A significant portion of the Collective's food is dumpstered. We believe that dumpstering is a just method of obtaining and repurposing unsellable but nourishing food in order to feed as many people as possible while helping to fill a gap in our food distribution system.

We plan and hold community events about once a month.

We treat our house like a living organism. Our house guidelines and identity are articulated in a living document called the Genome, which community members regularly revisit and update to fit the Collective's needs as it grows and changes. We hold weekly meetings, make decisions via consensus, and strive to maintain a reciprocal relationship where the Collective actively supports and feeds the individuals that comprise it, and the individuals in turn support and feed the Collective.

You have beguiled me with desire, O Christ, and with love divine transformed me-- Orthodox Liturgy

We are a small, Orthodox Christian, community located at 155 Broadview Ave (East Toronto). We are seeking to build a communal life that is structured around the reality of God’s love in the midst of the city. Our life together is marked by the rhythms of prayer, study, liturgy, community life, and a variety of work motivated by a deep respect and love for the poor (our masters, as the early church reminds us). Some of our projects involve running a bakery, thrift store, visitor house, and creating spaces where people can exist without charge and come to discover their own value and mystery. Most recently, we are looking to find ways to be present for folks who are living in very difficult high rises in neighboring Scarborough. We are renting out apartments and attempting to participate more fully in the lives of these neighbors and looking for ways we can offer Xt (love, joy, beauty) into these spaces. All of this work is informed by an overarching attempt to live more deeply and boldly into the intoxicating vision of The Gospel and the Byzantine Liturgy. Though we are committed to the deep value of our tradition, our community includes people from a wide variety of traditions. We have a beautiful mission that is divided into two rooms. One is a place of outreach where dinners are served.  Our life has been deeply influenced by the writings of Jean Vanier, Dorothy Day, and the spirituality of the Little Brothers of Jesus. Applicants need not be orthodox but they would need to be interested in learning about this faith and participating in our liturgical and prayer life. Room and board can be provided. Interested folks should contact Gary at goneil327@gmail.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/st-john-the-compassionate-mission/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/st-john-the-compassionate-mission/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are small group of young adults (mostly in our late 20s and early 30s). The community was founded by a charismatic former Little Brother of Jesus who continues to live on top of the bakery. He is assisted in running the community by another young priest and an older deacon. We are trying to build a substantial lay wing to this community.</description>

October 22, 7pm. 2B Oakway Rd, Timonium, Md.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/universalus-intentional-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/universalus-intentional-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This community wishes to establish a community of secular dharma practitioners. Living in harmony and care with individuals of common core values. 
Here is the thesis:
Intentional Community 
Theses of dharma 
•    We are committed to the practice of the dharma.
•    The practice of the dharma consists of four tasks: to embrace suffering, let go of reactivity, behold the ceasing of reactivity and to cultivate an integrated way of life.
•    All persons, irrespective of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability or religion can practice these four tasks. Each person, in each moment, has the potential to be more awake, responsive, and free.
•    The practice of the dharma is more concerned with how one speaks, acts and works in public than how one performs spiritual exercises in private.
•    The community honors the dharma teachings that have been passed down through different traditions while seeking to enact them creatively in ways appropriate to the flourishing of the community at large.
•    The community of practitioners is formed of autonomous persons who mutually support each other in the cultivation of their paths. In this community of like-minded individuals, members respect the equality of all members while honoring the specific knowledge and expertise each person brings.
•    The community and its members are committed to an ethics of care, founded on empathy, compassion, and love for all creatures who have evolved on this earth.
•    The community and its practitioners seek to understand and diminish the roots of violence that are present in themselves and in the society and institutions at large.
•    The community of dharma practitioners aspires to nurture a culture of awakening that finds inspiration in Buddhist and non-Buddhist, religious and secular sources alike.
S.B.; After Buddhism

Just as a farmer irrigates his field, Just as a fletcher fashions an arrow, Just as a carpenter shapes a piece of wood, So the sage tames the self.
Care is the path to the deathless; Carelessness the path to death. The caring do not die; The uncaring are as if already dead.
The sage moves through a village, Just as the bee gathers pollen, And flies off without harming, The flower, its color, or its fragrance. From the Dhammapada

      <name>Psytrance Bisexual community :)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22889&quot;&gt;Psytrance Bisexual community :)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Hi! Do you love psytrance? Are you bisexual?
if you said yes to both questions, then here is a piece of pie for you &amp;lt;3

Why psytrance, you might ask, and why bisexual only, you might also ask, you sillypie with oh so many questions.

I feel psychedelic trance provides the glue that will hold the community together. Psy trance has its own energy code we all know about and love. We can organize parties and why not our very own festival :D
We know if we all love psy-trance, then we probably have much in common, apart from our sexuality. 

Then why bisexual only? Because... because!
Yep, thorough answer to your questions.

Let&amp;#039;s grow together! and shine like buttercups &amp;lt;3

spirituality/shamanism allowed and encouraged. 

:)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/psytrance-bisexual-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/psytrance-bisexual-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ok I will use this to talk about logistics.

I chose Dutch forests, because:
They are in the midsts of beautiful nature, but also close to Amsterdam city.
Not sure if we will live in the actual forest, but at least nearby so we can have awesome walks there and pretend we are hobbits and elves.

We are a short flight away to most European cities like London, Berlin, etc, where the trance scenes are awesome. 
We are in Europe =  Psytrance festival season in the summer wohoooooooooo :E

Now, this community is &quot;Open Source&quot; so, anyone can suggest other alternatives, like, renting instead of buying, living nearer Amsterdam instead of in Veluwe, living in a big house versus living in small private houses, etc.

what else? yes, bring a pillow for pillow fights</description>

      <name>Urban Coup</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22892&quot;&gt;Urban Coup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Urban Coup will be a resilient, positive and diverse community that contributes to a healthier world, and one that enriches its residents' lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/urban-coup/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/urban-coup/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Urban Coup (the 'Coup') is an initiative of a group of Melbournians who share a vision of creating not just housing, but community...but more than this, home is where our community is, our family, friends – the networks that support and nourish us.

We are a cohesive community that is welcoming, supportive and inclusive of all individuals. We currently have two cohousing projects in development, driven by slightly different needs and the extensive shared knowledge of our memebership.

Urban Coup also presents a range of opportunities for engaging and sharing with diverse local communities via supportive activities. This may lead to partnership, social enterprise or simply manifest kinship within our local hood via volunteer activities. Examples include: a food cooperative; local garden and food exchange; skill exchange workshops; upcycling activities and support for diverse local causes. We actively encourage the development of cohousing communities in Australia. 

We have more than 35 members so far, but are always looking for more, as these members are divided between the two current projects. We also hope to be able to incorporate some social housing into the mix of accommodation, however this will depend on opportunities. 

'Near and Tall'

 Near and Tall is a high-density apartment development close to the CBD. This project is at an advanced stage of planning, with a partner architect and developer engaged, and is actively seeking participants as either owner/occupiers or investors. Members Contract Pack will be available for signature in late November, and a Terms Sheet will be available for investors five weeks later. Projected move-in date in December 2019.

'Far and Wide'

Far and wide is a lower-density garden-st development in the middle to outer suburbs. The project is in an earlier stage and is seeking participants to further develop the plan.

Real names for each project will be decided by the community based on the site, when it is secured. Urban Coup is a group of committed people preparing to purchase land and develop an environmentally sustainable urban cohousing community. We are a cohesive community that is welcoming, supportive and inclusive of all individuals. Both projects hope to purchase land and begin to build in 2017. 

Urban Coup was formed in May 2008, when a group of like-minded folk gathered to discuss their dreams of what living in such a community would be like. We found we had a lot in common and thus decided to work together to build first our group, and then the dream: a new co-housing community. We are now comprised of a healthy mx of couples, families and singles.

The group is made up of people from many different backgrounds, with health professionals, graphic artists, architects, designers, urban designers, environmentalists, engineers - who are now becoming friends. Currently, we meet fortnightly and often socialise before or after the meeting. We also go away together a couple of times a year to enjoy being in community whilst we build our dream. 

In this time, Urban Coup has developed an extensive invetory of healthy group processes and proactive ways of dealing with conflict should it arise. We operate under a consensus decision-making model and our conflict-resolution processes are based on the non-violent communications (NVC) approach. Members are offered training in both these group processes.

And the name? No, ‘coup’ is not a spelling mistake. The Urban Coup is our way of living differently to help ourselves to help the planet. Choosing to build a cohousing development is our answer to an age when global resources are being strained by modern living, urban sprawl is ever-expanding, and many of us in the city find ourselves isolated from real community in our current homes.</description>

      <name>Willow House Christian Intentional Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22893&quot;&gt;Willow House Christian Intentional Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Indeed we share expenses and space to ease the economic burden of living. But more importantly, we believe that by living together we will see one another as we really are, which will (we hope) lead us individually and corporately to repentance, forgiveness, grace, and growth as we seek Jesus together.

We are completely on the grid as we are limited by the surrounding infrastructure and fiscally. We do have a wood-burning fireplace and hope for a wood stove at some point.

We don't grow much food on our property, though we grow a little more each year. Alternatively, we seek to support local farmers through CSA's (for produce) and herd share (for raw dairy). One of us runs a natural foods co-op and we get a lot of our food from there too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/willow-house-christian-intentional-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/willow-house-christian-intentional-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We're just a group of normal 20- and 30-somethings living completely on the grid in urban Roanoke, Virginia. We have four bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, a cute little dog, and a lot of love. We might have an extra room for you.

It costs a little bit of money. Unfortunately, we do have bills!

We're college-educated, grow / eat as organically / locally / ethically as we can, read a lot, cook a lot, enjoy good beer and bourbon (if it isn't a stumbling block for someone), and like to talk about things that are meaningful. Most of all, we love, love, love Jesus. That's what this is really about. Fellowship. Iron sharpening iron. Exhortation. Living as biblically as we know how. We go to All Nations Church. We don't care where you go as long as it's biblical and you're committed. That's how this can work.

We have interfaith friends and love people who believe differently than us, but our home is not interfaith; that is not the purpose right now. Consider us your friendly urban Roanoke monastery that affirms secular jobs and marital hanky-panky -- or just a kind of faith-based intentional community.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22894&quot;&gt;Ommhome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to help facilitate positive social change through realization of one’s true nature and harmonious living. Our main goal is to educate people how to live mindfully in the Now and with purpose, but also understand at their core that the nature of the Universe is playful and not serious. If you’re dwelling about the future or past, you’re missing what is happening in the current moment, which is all there really is; an “Eternal Now”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/tao-te-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/tao-te-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ommhome is a tiny nonprofit retreat center and intentional community on the big island of Hawaii dedicated to helping people find a natural and harmonious way of transcending their anxiety and depression, including bipolar disorder, and live a life full of vitality and love. Mindfulness is the key, specifically meditation, yoga, internal arts, diet, communal living and being connected with nature. Our vision is off an off-grid permaculture eco-village with rustic minimalistic structures in the Puna region.

Our belief is that most mental health issues are a result of living in disharmony and that “highly sensitive persons”, usually creative individuals, are far more likely to be pushed over the edge by their enivornment.

The Ommhome mission is to help facilitate positive social change through realization of one’s true nature and harmonious living. Our main goal is to educate people how to live mindfully in the Now and with purpose, but also understand at their core that the nature of the Universe is playful and not serious. If you’re dwelling about the future or past, you’re missing what is happening in the current moment, which is all there really is; an “Eternal Now”.

We are completely donation based, like Vipassana, because we believe in giving without expecting something in return (even Karma), but we do have suggested minimum donation amounts and work hours in order to make sure that we can stay in operation.

Ommhome is meant to be a 501c3 educational nonprofit organization completely funded on the goodwill and generosity of others, and serve as a demonstration of how passionate people can create other organizations like this.

At this stage we are looking for the intrepid individuals who are passionate about this cause and want to put in the hard work to make this center a reality. The community aspect is secondary to the retreat center part, with the idea that the community will grow organically over time.</description>

      <name>Quaker House Residential Community (QHRC)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22895&quot;&gt;Quaker House Residential Community (QHRC)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Experiment in Quaker community under the care of Ann Arbor Friends Meeting, committed to diversity and inclusivity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/quaker-house-residential-community-qhrc/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/quaker-house-residential-community-qhrc/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;QHRC is a small intentional living community. We share and care for a beautiful six-bedroom, turn-of-the-twentieth-century house in Ann Arbor, close to the University of Michigan's central campus. 

We strive to embody our strong commitments to: multi-cultural/ intergenerational/ racial/ ethnic/ LGBT inclusivity; delicious, healthy meals; simple, economical, and environmentally friendly living; mature, stable, supportive relationships; and open, forthright, and honest communication.

Quaker membership is not required though we respect and uphold the spiritual leadings of the Ann Arbor Friends Meeting (peace, nonviolence, social justice, and respect for all).

Regular evening meals are a central activity of the QHRC. Each housemate cooks for the others a few times a month, and participates in weekly and monthly chores as well as regular house meetings; this participation totals approximately ten hours per week. A monthly financial contribution is required. There is a formal application process.

The first floor of Quaker House is frequently used for community events. The second and third floors are exclusively used by residents. The house is smoke free. Pets are not allowed. At least a one-year commitment preferred. 

Quaker House has had a varied history. From 1955, when Friends purchased it, until 1962, it served as the meetinghouse. For many years it housed an international student cooperative. In 1983, the Meeting discerned that “The purpose of Quaker House is to enrich the life of the Meeting and to carry forward the testimonies, values, and concerns of Friends through outreach to the wider community.” Between 1984 and 1991 Quaker House was home for a refugee family from El Salvador and for a small community of Quakers from the Meeting. Since 1991, Quaker House has been home to the Quaker House Residential Community (QHRC), a cooperative living community under the care of the Meeting. 

This community was originally envisioned by the Ann Arbor Friends Meeting as &quot;a small group of people living in Quaker House and exploring what Quaker community means. We feel that Quaker principles such as seeking the Light, speaking to that of God in every person, living simply, and making decisions by consensus are wonderful underpinnings for creating such a community. The group’s exploration may lead it into spiritual sharing and deepening; new ways of working, struggling, and celebrating with each other; and/or providing each other with support and challenge to reach out to the larger community.&quot;</description>

      <name>Lincoln Court: A Mixed Use Intentional Creative Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22896&quot;&gt;Lincoln Court: A Mixed Use Intentional Creative Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; In addition to the innovative mixed uses, including affordable and universally accessible housing and cohousing, is a higher purpose around creativity - creative aging, nurturing artistic entrepreneurs, cultural exhibits and performances in residence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/lincoln-court-a-mixed-use-intentional-creative-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/lincoln-court-a-mixed-use-intentional-creative-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The LINCOLN COURT is a mixed-use intentional urban community. The project is a collaboration among Wyoming Community Media, Caddis Architects, Wonderland Hills Development and Dozzer LLC. 

In addition to the innovative mixed uses, including affordable and universally accessible housing and cohousing, is a higher purpose around creativity - creative aging, nurturing artistic entrepreneurs, cultural exhibits and performances in residence.

Plans are to develop on the 20-acre Back 40 Subdivision on the West End of Cheyenne, Wyoming, consistent with the approved Missile Driver Corridor Plan.

The property is adjacent to the former Hitching Post Inn site. The project name is homage to the Lincoln Court, a motor lodge that preceded the Hitching post, which fronted on the Historic Lincoln Highway (US 30).

The project is planned to be a mixed-use development consisting of owner occupied (possibly some rental), universally accessible senior and inter-generational dwelling units – detached and duplexes with the &quot;cohousing overlay&quot;, civic and community spaces and appropriate retail that would support the community such as a coffee shop, offices, live-work options.

The project will be anchored by the proposed City of Cheyenne sports complex adjacent to the Ice Center.

The LINCOLN COURT also is interested in innovative continuous care, including inter-generational &quot;green houses&quot; as championed by Bill Thomas for caregivers who could live &quot;on site&quot; in the cohousing community with their disabled family members who need more intensive and specialized health care nearby.

The target market is wide open and consists of inter-generational individuals and families, as well as seniors over 50 years of age, who may be local or out-of-town &quot;empty-nesters&quot; and wanting to downsize, &quot;vigorous retired&quot; people wanting to stay active and age in a community setting. In support of this, the project will investigate compatible services such as personal care, urgent care.

The project is a public/private partnership with strong private-sector partners and the affordable housing component involving participation by local, state and federal government agencies. The project is economically viable with a balance among strong equity from the public and private non-profit sectors, debt financing and sales/lease.</description>

* housing must serve residents' needs
* more of your money should stay in your hands
* architectural design affects well-being
* people who have access to both community and privacy are healthier and happier.
* personal and community empowerment comes from individuals understanding the relationship and interplay between the wide angle view of community development and the individually focused aim of real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sun-villages-queanbeyan/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sun-villages-queanbeyan/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;74 apartment homes have already been built and sold in a mainstream way. Stage three of the total development is called Sun Villages, which is an additional 25 units with social spaces, flexible architecture for changing needs, ownership by way of company shares, and long-term leases that are unprecedented in their tenure and security and which vary according to how much space you occupy. The Sun Villages model is an Australia first, with several components from places around the world including elements of co-housing. Our financial model is designed to keep more money in your pocket where you don't have to pay: solicitors’ fees, stamp duty, mortgage insurance, bank fees, interest on a mortgage and agent fees when selling to upgrade or downgrade.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22900&quot;&gt;Eashira Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are an intentional community built around multi-generational households committed to sustainable living and shared resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/eashira-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/eashira-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;There was a time when multiple generations of families lived together in the same household or the same community for both ease and economy. Over the past few generations this concept has been lost in American culture, and many feel we are worse off for it. Each generation is pushed out of the home they were raised in, to build their life from scratch, shouldering tremendous financial burdens just to replace the family home they left. Children are disconnected from their grandparents and other relations. Parents are often left to carry the load of caring for and raising their family, on their own. 
We understand the need for privacy and independence as generations mature, and our village can provide this without being so disconnected from other generations. Our homes and land are designed and arranged for both private spaces and shared spaces within a household. We even extend the multigenerational concept so that a household contains multiple generations of multiple families. This further enriches the lives of everyone in the community and it allows us to share resources, skills, and experiences.
Our buildings are designed with “aging in place” features to accommodate families in all stages of life. This includes features such as wide doors, ground floor accommodations for mobility impaired family members, grab rails, easy to operate handles, minimal obstructions, and non-slip surfaces. Households have a variety of spaces for everyone from single adults, couples, or larger families, to accommodate everyone as their needs change.  
Having multiple generations of multiple families living in the same community, or even the same household has many advantages:
•	Family members experience the high level of emotional bonding and closeness across generations.
•	Older generations provide important role models in the socialization of children. Younger generations learn how to care for their elders.
•	Spending time with children can bring purpose and meaning to the lives of older generations. For example, the physical demands of keeping up with kids and helping with homework make them feel younger, more useful, and active.
•	Grandparents help grandchildren survive changes in their parent’s domestic structure by giving grandchildren undivided attention and helping when single parents are overwhelmed. 
•	Multigenerational families have financial benefits for everyone involved. If grandparents are in good health and willing, they can help care for young children. Adult children living in the multifamily household can save money while going to school, finding a job or saving money to buy their own shares in the village company.
•	Family members provide constant companionship, as well as help reduce financial strain and stress.
•	Village members look after, help and support each other.
•	Bringing village members together can be a joyful time to treasure and share.
•	While you have the ability for solitary time to yourself, you are never so isolated as to feel lonely or on your own.</description>

      <name>The Agrihood Project</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22901&quot;&gt;The Agrihood Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are a group of Calgarians seeking a more connected and rewarding life in a rural setting. Our dreams bring us together and help us create a vision that includes self-sufficiency, balance, and a deeper commitment to community and stewardship of the land. Our vision is to integrate our group into Rockyford and engage the residents of the Village and surrounding area in our projects. We want to actively and enthusiastically participate in the community while bringing the Agrihood to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-agrihood-project/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-agrihood-project/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;An agrihood is a housing development built around a farm and often includes a re-skilling component. Residents work together, contributing their labour and skills to grow delicious, nutritious food and keep the cost of food affordable. This arrangement makes farm-to-table living a reality.

Our plan includes three pillars. The first one is a Sustainability Centre, which is a demonstration site showcasing building methods and food growing in Southern Alberta. We will share our knowledge with others to build resilience and self-sufficiency. Our programs emphasize high-quality education and lifelong learning in both the Rockyford community and beyond. We also envision the Centre as both a demonstration site and a hands-on learning lab for program participants to connect concepts with real-world design. Programs are offered in tandem with the physical development of the site, allowing program participants to help design, build, and contribute.

The second pillar is growing food. Food security is important to all of us, and much of the school ground is dedicated to food production. A large greenhouse enables us to grow food year-round. We envision providing high-quality produce to the citizens of Rockyford and surrounding area, giving the residents the opportunity to buy local and support the village. In addition, our goal is to model a resilient and adaptive community that draws agri-tourists into Rockyford. 

And the final pillar is housing. Our focus with the housing is to create highly energy-efficient and healthy homes constructed out of environmentally responsible materials. Once the housing is completed, we anticipate there will be approximately 16 – 24 units, attracting 30 - 50 new residents to Rockyford.</description>

      <name>New Oleans Catholic Worker</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22902&quot;&gt;New Oleans Catholic Worker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Catholic Worker does not have a Mission statement per se. If it did it might be from Matthew 25:35-36. Sometimes known as the corporal works of mercy:
    Feed the hungry,
        Give drink to the thirsty,
            Clothe the naked,
                Care for the ill,
                    Visit the imprisoned,
                        Welcome the stranger.

At St. Thomas House, &quot;welcoming the stranger&quot; means we invite houseless families into our home and all that taking care of a home and the people within it entails: paying for rent, utilities, food, cooking that food, doing lots of dishes and laundry.

​If you value this as well, please help us. We would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/new-oleans-catholic-worker/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/new-oleans-catholic-worker/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;More  on  what  we  do . . .

What we do at the Catholic Worker can be analogous to a 3-legged stool—the 3 legs being Spirituality, Resistance and Community with each leg having not  only action but values and beliefs as well. So what does all that mean?

For Spirituality, ​we study the Bible, we pray.

For Community, we house houseless families; we also, serve a meal Tuesday at 6:00 pm for anyone who wants to come. 

For Resistance, we practice non-violence in resisting the dominant culture of the empire. We have a peace vigil Sundays at 2:00 pm and support other local peace and justice groups.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22903&quot;&gt;Paoli Area Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; A vibrant, sustainable community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/paoli-area-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/paoli-area-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We would like to start a community or ecovillage in this area if others have the same desire.  We would like it to be a good one for families and a place to do small-scale natural farming together.  We are moderate both on politics and religion so whether you're liberal or conservative you're welcome and if you're in between that might be the best fit. 

In this area there are a number of people who have interests in natural farming, ecological living, and similar things. Several of them are in the Paoli Mennonite Fellowship, which my family and I attend; there is also the Lost River Market and Deli, which sells natural foods and is a common gathering place.  Across the road from there is a natural healing center. Nearby is a yoga and meditation center just starting--the Old Tomato Factory, and Black Vulture studio is forming there too. Lazy Black Bear is a nearby place that hosts events focused on protecting the forest. Living roots Ecovillage is under ten miles away,  and there is a good farmers market in Orleans. 

I'm just starting growing fruit and nut trees, and gardens, mushrooms, and maple syrup. It would be fun to work with others expanding these things or even starting a dairy farm and cheesemaking, or a community workshop, canning area, or tool share, or any of many other possibilities.</description>

All are welcome regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion. We are looking to share the rent on an apartment or small house in Norman, depending on how many new members we have. Among our members are Buddhists, Pagans, Christians, and Hindus (and we are open to others!) and we share our spiritual paths with each other.

More than just a group house(s), we are founded on a deep commitment to sharing our labor, resources, and lives - together we can achieve more than any of us could individually. This manifests in many different ways; as a community we are fully income-sharing, with a single joint bank account. We reject the rigid market system and value all community-oriented labor equally, whether it's working a salaried job, doing housework, freelancing, or community organizing. We are dedicated to the principles of inclusion, feminism, anti-racism, and anti-discrimination. We strive to be egalitarian in all respects, and make decisions transparently and by consensus. We place high value on open, respectful, genuine communication, and desire a healthy, productive, and sustainable world for all people regardless of circumstance or nationality. If you resonate with these ideas then we'd love to hear from you. Our world is your world ... let's join forces!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22907&quot;&gt;Naturamata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Cerchiamo persone motivate e decise, disponibili subito, che vogliano trasferirsi in campagna, per condividere progetto di vita in autosufficienza. Non è un’offerta di lavoro, ma la ricerca di compagni di avventura che vogliono cambiare vita. Con capitale o senza capitale, non importa, ma bisogna almeno poter disporre per un paio d’anni di 300 -500 euro al mese per partecipare alle spese comuni. Dopo un primo periodo di assestamento la proprietà sarà donata ai partecipanti, che costituiranno un’associazione. Al momento c’è un agrumeto in produzione, un mandorleto in collina non irriguo da recuperare, molti ulivi sparsi in parte selvatici. Tutto quello che si realizza dalla vendita dei prodotti, verrà fin da subito condiviso. Il territorio, grande e vario, è quello di un antichissimo podere nella zona di Carlentini (SR), con caseggiati e vecchi impianti, un bosco di querce, panoramico, arieggiato e ricco di macchia mediterranea. Le abitazioni sono da sistemare, ma in parte abitabili subito. Molte persone provano e rinunciano, perché c’è molto da lavorare. La vita in campagna non è quella che si vede in tv, ma quella che ti sporca le mani e ti piega la schiena, per vedere crescere i tuoi prodotti genuini e un pezzo di pianeta diventare la tua casa. Perciò occorre essere determinati e forti, nel corpo e nello spirito, e soprattutto liberi da condizionamenti filosofici, etici e religiosi che impediscono l’armonia con una natura bella e crudele. Per maggiore chiarezza: il progetto è incompatibile con scelte vegetariane, animaliste, pacifisti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/naturamata/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/naturamata/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Dall'etimologia borgo significa città fortificata e mercantile, torre, nell'uso comune è un quartiere della città, usualmente fuori le mura. In altre spiegazioni si legge anche la differenza fra borgo e villaggio, dove il primo può essere considerato una città anche molto piccola, ma importante ed autonoma, il secondo rimane spesso un'insieme di case e di persone privo di struttura economica e politica.
 
Sta tutta qui la differenza fra il borgo rurale e l'ecovillaggio, come si suole chiamare una comunità di nuova tendenza nel linguaggio forbito dell' utopia contemporanea. L'ecovillaggio si rappresenta spesso come un'isola felice, al di fuori del travaglio e dei conflitti di una società in continua trasformazione, in realtà sono progetti rimasti sulla carta o esperienze travagliate come tutte le altre.
 
Questo non è il progetto di un ecovillaggio ma di un borgo rurale.
Il borgo mi fa pensare al maniscalco, all'osteria, al mercato, ai viandanti, alle botteghe artigiane, al disordine di gente operosa e libera, anche avventuriera o temeraria, ai contrasti stridenti fra ricchezza e povertà, allo scontro giornaliero fra la bontà  e la cattiveria, fra l'arrogante ignoranza e la signorilità. Il borgo è un luogo dove convivono lavoro e passione, cultura e divertimento, regole e galera, natura e scienza. 
 
Ma andiamo con calma, non vogliamo costruire una città, non c'è lo spazio, anche il borgo sarebbe troppo grande. Del borgo prenderemo il dinamismo, l'assetto territoriale, l'idea delle fortificazioni. Abbiamo anche la torre e un alto promontorio detto il &quot;poggio di progenio&quot;, da dove guardare le coste, nel caso che il nemico venisse dal mare.
 
Ma in tempo di pace faremo l'orto, la carciofaia, pianteremo i legumi e i cavolfiori, le zucche, cureremo l'agrumeto, gli ulivi, i mandorli e i fichidindia. Faremo i contadini a tempo pieno, per coltivare la terra e mangiare da re, perciò saremo anche saggi, nobili e generosi, come i veri re.
 
Verranno fuori le diversità, alcuni saranno miti e riflessivi, altri irruenti ed istintivi, qualcuno amerà la strategia, altri la poesia o la cura del corpo se non quella della mente. Il carattere  forte ed equilibrato trascinerà quello più debole, quello smaliziato aprirà gli occhi al timido. Alcuni lavoreranno la terra, altri la esplorereranno, tutti insieme la conquisteremo, per strapparla ai devastatori e agli usurpatori; non ci sarà pace senza giustizia, non ci sarà libertà senza lotta. Il male non va ignorato o evitato, ma affrontato, sia che abbia le sembianze umane, quelle di una forza occulta o di una infezione virale. Non aspetteremo la buona sorte, andremo a cercarla ovunque si trovi.
 
Il terreno è grande, bello e fertile, l'ideale per mettere su casa e lavoro, famiglie, singoli, coppie, alla fine un gruppo di amici che si organizza per vivere e produrre.
 
Non inventeremo nulla di speciale: quando tutto sembrerà normale, sarà già speciale.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22908&quot;&gt;Armadillo Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are a group of local artists and techies working to create a new housing alternative in Austin, Texas. We are planning a neighborhood based on the “cohousing” model, which started in Denmark and has now spread worldwide. There are hundreds of cohousing communities in the US, Canada, Australia, Sweden, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium, Austria, and elsewhere. We want to be the first successful one here in ATX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/armadillo-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/armadillo-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This new neighborhood strives to be a physical reflection of the Capital City’s best characteristics: self-expression, art/music/creativity, collaborative cooperation, exuberant celebration, welcoming hospitality, aesthetic beauty, clever utility, wondrous weirdness, and environmental ethos.

We are a circle of individuals and families of any age, genetics, national origin, religion, gender identity, dietary preference, political leaning, or physical/mental ability who want to live or work as an ownership-based collective.

Dillo CoHos are about maintaining interpersonal connections to apportion living and working spaces beyond traditional suburbs, residential towers, or apartment blocks, including in-common and private areas for gardens, socializing, craft-making, dining, and storage.

Our members aim to develop or re-purpose an affordable, mixed-use, multifamily property in the Austin area based on Permaculture and ecological design principles in a mutually supportive climate.</description>

We needed something, anything, so we consensed...then we travelled...then we worked...then we suffered...then we died...because it wasn't actually sustainable...it wasn't even livable...and ultimately it wasn't survivable.

This option removes the encumbrance of land ownership, which arguably is impossible--or at the least incredibly injust--in these united states...

You can be a nomad anywhere.
You can help others anywhere.

Primarily sailboats.
Secondarily water-based living.
Tertiary nomadic lifestyle.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22910&quot;&gt;Woodbury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; My vision is to bring together a small number of daring, independent, and nice families and individuals to help create a home where we can share resources, farm, brew beer, drink beer or wine, cultivate mushrooms, create art, and be an oasis from the city for those of us who work there. As we evolve and grow, we may even be able to use our land to provide some or even all of our income, making us truly self-sustaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/woodbury/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/woodbury/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The goal of Woodbury (no, I’m not married to the name…) is to combine the resources of its members into either a land trust or other legal entity that will allow us to leverage our funds to purchase enough acreage to allow us to be nearly self-sustaining or even potentially generate enough income to offset the cost of owning.

There is no master philosophy, dogma, or oppressive covenants, please. You may smoke, I don’t; that’s fine. I don’t want to be anyone’s mother. Maybe your family is into home schooling. I’m in my 40’s so I won’t be attending … unless there’s cookies. What may set this community apart is that we aim to have amenities close enough for everyone to enjoy and get a sense of connectedness with others while having enough space to allow for solitude and privacy.

The biggest hurdle to creating this community is that the only way it will become real (spoiler alert: or any cohousing/intentional community) is for all families and individuals to be solvent enough to qualify for the mortgage. Although we may end up purchasing a very large piece of farmland that could allow for us to enable share-cropping, exchange of services, barter, etc., we cannot accept anyone at this stage who isn’t able to invest financially in their share of the community.

Some of the proposed ideas for Woodbury include:
A Modest Common House—a place where we can meet, socialize and share meals and memories. Many properties already have homes built on them already that we could use for the common house without building new.

Residence—In order to maximize the flexibility, sustainability, and affordability of our new residences, the current plan is to build customized container homes. Our homes can be stand-alone or attached to other neighbors as desired.

Retreat/Vacation Home—Those who want a place in the country to visit and relax on the weekends may enjoy living in Woodbury part time. One option if we choose, is to have retreats where people can camp, do morning meditations to awaken their spirits. 

Sustainability—Our building practices, water usage, food production, and energy production will be designed to be self-sustaining. Our home will use less energy through smart design, generate all the energy we do need from renewable solar electric, possibly hydropower, and/or recaptured methane. 
(no) Zombies!—This isn’t a doomsday bunker cul de sac, but we want to be a resilient as well as sustainable community. Residents can stock emergency supplies, food and water. They can also be a source of help for each other when needed.

Food—Our goal is to acquire enough land capable to feed everyone in the community, perhaps more. We will primarily focus on permaculture and create both tillable crops as well as a food forest. There will be an outdoor community garden during the growing season and greenhouse during the winter. 
Income generating if feasible—With the amount of land we may potentially have, the possibility of offsetting the cost of our homes should be considered. We may want to build a community center to host seminars and ongoing workshops. In the end, the possibility of income will depend on the talent and availability of community members.
Frugal when possible—A key goal is make Woodbury affordable, not requiring two full-time jobs per household just to get by. To control costs, we are pooling finances to buy a large property to reduce the build cost per acre, employ modular building techniques with container homes lowering the cost while making the ability to add on to the home far cheaper than conventional buildings.
We are organizing now to find the rest of you that want to join us in this adventure.</description>

At the center is collaborative shared space, dorm/hostel style. We are quickly acquiring new spaces in order to offer infinite indoor and outdoor living spaces. We are building collaborative relationships in our surrounding community that offer infinite fulfillment for all. We are experiencing ways of being in the world that work for everyone. We are focused on healing, spiritual practice, and being intentional in all aspects of life. We have intentions of offering healing retreats as well as regular collective healing practices for all in the community. We are a block away from an urban farm and market, across the street from a beautiful park, two blocks away from an amazing artistic intentional community, a block away from Atlanta’s beltline (a paved multi-purpose trail that traverses the city and has infinite community building properties), and walkable to an eco-friendly library. The connective and healing potential of our village is infinite. People are contributing in infinite ways, contributing the joy and the gifts that they are. For those contributing financially, it is currently infinitely affordable at 300.00/month. All things are possible. Reach out to us as you feel warmly drawn and explore the beautiful possibilities for collaboration! Thank you!</description>

Our community presently consists of four adults. We are American, Ukrainian, and Mexican. Our visitors are from all over the world. We created Supra Rustico (SuRu) with the intention of living in a relaxed, tranquil environment. San Francisco, Nayarit, is well known for it's laid back lifestyle, good vibes, and great surfing. Our space is approx. 100x50 meters of riverfront right in the heart of San Pancho. Our neighbors include Entre Amigos community center, and the Jaguar Conservation Society. Beautiful scenery, wildlife, and a warm-hearted local population make this one of the really special villages along the Riviera Nayarit coastline. 5 minutes from Sayulita.  We currently have cold showers, bathroom, electricity, gas stove, fridge, and all basic needs. We have a two-bedroom house, a covered patio kitchen area, a terrace, and a palapa along the river. It's rustic but we have everything we need, and plenty of space to expand, or pitch tents.

At Supra Rustico we try to take it easy and enjoy life. We ask that members be willing to contribute in creative ways. Video equipment is highly prized, and we are working on several creative projects. If you have something you are working on, we can help, or allow you the space to concentrate.

All we ask in return is that you are peaceful, friendly and contribute in some way. We've got ample room, and a few hangout areas. No jerks, and no bullies, please. We have a lot of visitors already, and the vibe is chilled. The town has everything, great live music, plenty of art, and culture, and it's economical. We are attempting to chisel out our own little corner of paradise, and we welcome visitors. We have tents and enjoy building.</description>

Values
* Sustainability (Emotional, Environmental, Fianancial, Energetic)
* EnJOYment (Find Joy in what we do)
* Nature (Returning back to Nature itself, and Natural ways of Living closer to Nature each time)
* Wisdom from Anscestral Cultures (Rituals, Ceremonies, healing tools, natural medicines, attitudes and lifestyles)
* Education / Ethics / integrity
* Diversity and Intercultural Exchange&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/natale/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/natale/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;After 14 years of patience and persistence, I am closer to being successful in my life vision project. 
Thank you to two of my dearest friends that I am blessed to walk this planet with, I have received a donation of enough money to now go and buy two hectares in the Sierra of Oaxaca, where I always imagined the project to take place. I have done my preliminary work and training over the years and have enough knowledge on the matter and all the right contacts to make it happen as soon as I know which part of the Earth needs me to be her guardian. 
This year is destined for answering to the land’s call and purchasing the right to be on it, develop it with Permaculture design principle and live there peacefully, receiving people in the years to come who are seeking to learn about Natural Building, Community living and who are also looking for a place to retreat to and do personal work.
I am building up a web page with a blog to inform people interested in this project’s development, as well as a donation system, for receiving any additional help people want to provide along the way.
I am currently starting to write a more detailed description on the different phases of the project so to give a clearer idea of the short-, medium- and long-term vision of how I see it in the NOW.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22916&quot;&gt;Petawawa Tribal - Shared Housing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To provide a shared household where members can rely on one another, form bonds and with the saved time and resources of sharing, have more free time to enjoy the important things in life. We prioritize social connection, feasts of real food together and playing together. Hiking, sports, movie nights, board game nights and art nights are held in the household. 

Healthy and balanced living is important to us. Mindfulness practices are part of the routine of several members already, and we use circadian lighting throughout the entire house to support everyone's hormonal balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/petawawa-tribal-shared-housing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/petawawa-tribal-shared-housing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We have been interested in living in an intentional community and eco villages but modern circumstances of career mean we live in Petawawa, Ontario. So we decided to move in to a shared housing unit. We made friends over the last year and now the members of that shared household have gotten together to share a complete house together. 

While we aren't right out in nature, its a 5-minute walk to the rapids and there's plenty of wilderness about. In this house we love cooking, eating and playing together. There is a big table where we share feasts and meals of real food and love playing board games.

Let's call Petawawa Tribal an unintentional group that decided to form an intentional community. 

It's a bilingual household, so if you need practice then we'll be happy to oblige. 

Members come from diverse backgrounds but are respectful, helpful and friendly.</description>

We are a skill-sharing community with ongoing learning and production of our own food, energy and entertainment.  In this way we reduce our income needs and need for outside resources; but continue to integrate with the local and regional community in order to not become reclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/earthen-heart-community-homestead/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/earthen-heart-community-homestead/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Earthen Heart is a 20 acres parcel in Southwest Michigan.  It is being developed as an Eco-Habitat with permaculture principles.  The main home is a renovated old farm house with 3 bedrooms. The main house also has shared community community space for meals, showers, laundry, Internet and phone, yoga space, grid-connection etc. There are several outbuildings and space for trailers, campers, campsites for tents or earthen buildings, etc. which are used by visitors and long term members on the property. 

After 7 years, Phase II of Earthen Heart has begun in 2018!  We will be offering short term stays through Air B&amp;amp;B in order to generate income to fund the management of the property and ongoing development.  We are also looking for qualified and financially stable individuals to consider a more long term stay as well.  That is why we continue to list here.

The Earthen Heart goal is to create a lean rural alternative where we live more simply and reduce our consumption levels but increase our quality of life.  We strive to generate more of our own food, housing, art and energy on-site in a skill sharing educational growing community.  We have walking perennial food and medicine trails and gardens, blueberry patch, garlic and onions, potatoes, corn, fruit and nuts, many greens, asparagus, strawberries, etc.  Generally there are some domestic and farm animals around such as chickens, goats, dogs, cats.</description>

Our goal is to create a pocket neighborhood community consisting of families who have the opportunity for home-ownership and include individuals often seen as ‘at-risk’ (elders, people who experience disability and people below median income). This community will be based on strengths, interests and shared values not deficits and needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/our-home-cathedral-park/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/our-home-cathedral-park/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our Home - Cathedral Park will be twenty, for-sale units and will range from 1 - 3 bedrooms between 600 - 1,500sf.  All units will face a central, shared, landscaped courtyard and have either direct access to the courtyard or to an outdoor deck that faces the courtyard.  Units will be efficient, sustainable, accessible, affordable, aesthetically pleasing, welcoming and a neighborhood asset. The Our Home - Cathedral Park will provide the hub of home to ground from and extend out from for work, school and the larger community where our children, our adults, and our seniors can build relationships and community. Through private and community partnerships, Our Home plans to make available a percentage of homes at below market prices or will assist with supports and subsidies to encourage affordability for individuals or families at 80% or below of median income.</description>

There are three main principles to be concentrated on: (1) ENVIRONMENTALISM--meeting the goal of only using 100% clean energy (solar and wind) on a permanent basis; utilizing plant-based bio-compounds; aquaponic greenhouses for organic fish &amp;amp; vegetables  (2) FUTURISM---having the architectural and design elements reflect the fun optimism of the modern futurism aesthetic; (3) DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM---trying to live up to the social and governmental philosophy that prioritizes people living in a society with the environment, instead of prioritizing the making money for individuals sake.

Community members will be expected to finance the purchase and construction of their own home, but community help with construction would certainly be possible. I'm proposing five types/styles of houses from current manufacturers to be available as choices: Geodesic Domes, ICOSA Pods, NOMAD Microhouses, A-Frames, ROMERO LV Houses.</description>

We have individual households which we maintain financially on a personal/household basis; we collectively maintain shared resources such as the land (130 acres belongs to NMC, our dues cover land taxes and maintenance costs for shared resources ) including several fields and a large forested area, farm equipment (most all but the tractor needs some serious TLC), tools, barns, sauna, driveways/culverts, etc. The land has been pesticide/herbicide free since 1972 (and most likely much longer before that) and we keep it that way (ie. work with VDOT and power company to maintain own clearing of right of way along roads/power lines, have a policy of not using these chemicals, etc). Each homestead generally maintains their own food production, although we trade and share our bounty of our various endeavors which include currently  (at the different homesteads)  bee keeping, several goats, 1 cow (who is trying to get pregnant and milk), chickens, rabbits, veggie gardens (of course!), a perma-culture inspired forest berry garden. Community members meet about 2 times a month for meetings, but meet for social events (potlucks, bonfires, movie nights, equinoxes and other sacred celebrations). We do not push any food/religious/cultural practice on anyone other than reaching for sustainability and that is one thing we love about it here, we have independence to explore our hobbies without judgment and get to learn from everyone's interests, such as car repair and welding! We just ask folks live as closely with the earth as their heart and mind needs, and as our oldest member says &quot;live simply so that others can simply live.&quot;</description>

We are over one hour away from the two larger towns of Cabo San Lucas and La Paz.  Todos Santos is an artistic community with many art studios and yoga classes. 

I have friends in our neighborhood that bought land around 2004 and built houses of all kinds...big, little, some sustainable and made with alternative building materials. There is a mix of gringo and Mexican people.  We live in a neighborhood where the lots are reasonably priced so that the co-housing/neighbornet idea can take hold easily.  (Also, there are some rentals available off and on.)  This proposed ecovillage is a loosely defined geographical area comprised of privately owned households. 

Our vision is that people buy their own piece of land whether they are a family, single person or group.  Then everyone will donate some money to buy collectively a piece of land where we can build whatever we want to do collectively....share meals, share child-rearing, elder care, garden, ecological projects, art projects, natural building, alternative energy projects, etc.  The vision is to help each other in the details of living, while we create a community that emphasizes sustainability, living sacred with the earth and supporting each other.   Members participate when they want to.  There are no mandatory activities.  We are just forming, so the details are yet to be created.</description>

Our outlook and values are pragmatic and centered on making life easier for our housemates by sharing the work of the home together with a focus on permaculture, sustainability and yogic principles. We do form strong bonds among members that are reminiscent of an idealized family. The central purpose of our community is derived from shared values of generosity toward co-living members, the earth and the wider community, a sense of service both to the home we inhabit and the members we live with, and a strong central work ethic both in our own lives and in service of the home, earth and community with which we live in partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/living-room-yoga-commune/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/living-room-yoga-commune/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Residents unite around a common interest to collaboratively manage a space, share resources, and coordinate activities which contribute creatively and intellectually to the world around them. We offer short-term accommodation and host outward facing events, increasing connections with the broader community and world. The community at Living Room Yoga Commune is focused on the principles of permaculture, yoga, and resilient living. Many housemates are a member of hOur Exchange Ypsilanti Time bank, which is connected to other timebanks in the county, state region and the world through the use of hOur World software.</description>

Our challenge continues to be finding a suitable location near goods, services, healthcare and social opportunities needed by Seniors; but when that is secured, we will name our property. Core members are retired, but we seek couples and singles age 50 and over. Austin enjoys a robust economy and a plethora of continuing educational, social, and cultural opportunities. Our intent is to build small but stylish single family homes and generational homes incorporating universal design for aging-in-place and low maintenance materials. Homes will be available for purchase in the range of $200K to $300K per unit by member occupants; and perhaps for rent under the same guidelines as apply to members. Our design concept includes flex bedrooms which may be used by guests or staff and possibly guest quarters in the Common House. A monthly fee will cover use of common areas, exterior insurance, grounds and building maintenance, and other agreed common costs. On our wish list is contract employees who provide a concierge menu of services such as housekeeping, transportation, meals, fitness, social and cultural opportunities. Our intent is to live independently among companionable neighbors for as long as possible. Please feel free to request an update on our progress and or to visit further about our concept and goals if you are a prospective member.</description>

This is a small ecovillage to exist on a 1.5 acre parcel of land at the south end of the Rensselaer Plateau in rural Stephentown NY. The land has already started to be developed, and I have lived on it for five months during 2015. My goal is to have three or four microhouses, along with three domed greenhouses for aquaponics and non-aquaponics growing, all surrounding a communal green with pools and ponds. We're ready for people to come now.

The house is owned by a married couple who live as part of the co-op with their 2 children. We have adequate space for 11 long-term members maximum, which includes 3 two-three room suites for couples/small families, 1 &quot;in-law quarters&quot; apartment with private kitchen and access, and 2 single bedrooms. 

We share housing to create a space to practice &quot;mindful living&quot; with the support and accountability of a small group. Through open dialogue and consensus-based agreements and practices, we try to understand and support one another's vocations, reduce expenses by splitting costs, reduce resource usage, and offer one another positive social support. We seek to be a safe space for people of diverse orientation, perspective and background.</description>

As it sits right now, we have not yet acquired any land to further this venture.  We are currently homesteading on a small rural lot outside of Shelton. We plan to place our home(stead) on the real estate market September 1st, 2017, although we are actively searching for land now.

We have been playing with this idea lately – there’s a 40-acre property for sale (in Mason County) that’s already sectioned off into 6 parcels. We are looking for four other like-minded families to join us in the purchase of this property. One parcel (the smallest: 5 acres) will be shared between the five families, and used primarily as animal pasture, animal housing, garden plots, etc. This property is within walking distance of a freshwater pond, as well as a saltwater inlet. 

The 6 parcels are all different sizes: (in order of tax ID numbers) 5 acres shared, 6.18 acres, 7.45 acres, 7.26 acres, 7.35 acres, 5.88 acres. You must be able to pay $50,000 to $60,000 for one of these parcels plus 1/5 of the 5-acre parcel. There is already a gated entrance, private road, power/internet, and home sites are established. Side note: we have chosen the 7.35 acre parcel.</description>

Our purpose on this land is to develop and maintain sacred space and to create a sanctuary where others may come to heal, to learn, to transform, and to evolve to their highest, most conscious beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/maya-retreat-center-eco-retreat-homestead/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/maya-retreat-center-eco-retreat-homestead/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We reside on ancient, sacred land. Our island is the oldest known barrier reef dating back 480 million years. Our property is lake front, and is sacred land where Native Americans resided and held ceremony.  We are developing the land into self-sustaining ecosystems.  We utilize permaculture and biodynamic farming techniques.
Our main house is primarily used for functions, events, and short-stay hosting. Our carriage house apartments are for longer-term community members. Cabins are used to serve volunteers, interns, short-stay hosting.
We believe in creating a higher conscious lifestyle and service to others. We are interested in individuals with some health and wellness background and training who would contribute to more workshops/events; and would fit in without lifestyle of co-housing with some sharing of land, property, and the beauty and fruits it has to offer.
We believe in promoting and supporting women who have struggled, and much of our focus is on teaching, training, and supporting women to evolve.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22929&quot;&gt;Grace Changes Everything Ministries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Educate individuals of Spiritual freedom, facilitate small community formation, and directly aid anyone seeking to live from their heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/grace-changes-everything-ministries/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/grace-changes-everything-ministries/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Job Summary

This is a brand new position within Grace Changes Everything Ministries. We have designed a new home-based community model that seeks a community leader to facilitate, develop, and grow its member base. Growth will be measured comprehensively but not least of which, spiritually and financially .

We are not a religion. We are not a church. We are not any sort of organization that aspires to a new set of rules in order to achieve genuine spiritual growth. Titles (pastor), degrees (seminary), and book knowledge (biblical literature) have never genuinely taken the place of relationships, community, and encouragement. We do believe in God and we believe that He/She is divinely and actively working and communicating.

Has this ever been done before?

Some progressive spiritual leaders around the world have created a truer sense of community within their existing religious infrastructure ( Relevant: Faith, Culture, &amp;amp; Intentional Living , Jan-Feb 2018, pps. 068-070). Francis Chan in 2013 notably developed, &quot;We Are Church&quot; out of San Francisco, CA, a home-based affinity group of a church-planting network. However, there is no network currently developing that has stepped away from the church culture without leaving faith, and focused entirely on the spiritual, emotional, psychological, and economical well-being of a small group of 12-15 individuals. There is no non-profit corporation that seeks to develop a network of such communities for the inherent good of its member communities... until now: Grace Life Communities Association .

What qualifies me to be a community leader?

Your life experience, your work experience, and mostly your desire to learn the skill sets needed to start, facilitate, and grow a small, home-based, affinity community within our network. Grace Changes Everything Ministries equips all new prospective community leaders with relevant and comprehensive training. The founder also participates with every new community by way of a 4-6 week teaching experience with his book, &quot;Blinded by Normalcy: What is Life Anyways?&quot;

Is this a job? How do I make money?

This is most definitely a job. You are training to start, facilitate, and develop a small community as part of our network of affinity-based communities. You will ultimately be accountable for the growth of your community in terms of realizing your member's individual goals/dreams. You will be paid based both on the measured growth of your community's portfolio of local fundraising, income generated through individual member's economic activity, and corporate funding projects from Grace Changes Everything Ministries that you participate in securing.

How do I get started or learn more information?

Simply apply through this site. We will schedule a time to meet personally. This opportunity is currently available in Michigan, however expansion efforts are under way for growth regionally and nationally.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22931&quot;&gt;Serenity Yoga Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Love, peace, kindness, communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ahimsa-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ahimsa-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hello, Sat Nam, Namaste!

We are a family of 4 starting a small community for healers, energy workers, yoga teachers, and organic permaculturists.

Our background is in Kundalini yoga, Tantra, women's empowerment, and conscious relationships. We'd love to find like-minded people to live with in our community (separate housing on the same property) that we are also using as a retreat center and AirBNB.  We'd also like to grow most of our produce.  

Our experiences living in a 60-home co-housing village taught us a lot about what we want. We are looking for like-minded people who are homeowners or who have the funds to be homeowners and would like to join us in making our vision a reality.

Things that are important to us:

--The community will be based on love, peace, and communication.
--Spiritual and yoga-focused
--Shared meals several times a week
--Pet friendly (horses welcome, too!)
--like-minded neighbors, especially energy-workers, yogis, midwives, herbalists, and healers
--eco-friendly homes on one piece of land so that our kids can play together and go from house to house but each family will have their own space.
--organic community garden
--natural parenting
--Limited screen time for children
--Sustainable as much as possible...fruit trees, gardens, etc.
--No animals raised for meat on the property (meat eaters are welcome, just no killing on the land)
--Eco-friendly in as many ways as possible
--Children will be homeschooled, unschooled, or private schooled

Our community will include a Montessori school teacher or someone else who is a good candidate to teach our children to think for themselves and to be curious and explore the world around them, as well as teaching them responsibility and self-care, body-positivity, etc.

UPDATE as of March 2018:  We have land and it's grand!!!  We have a hoophouse, greenhouse, fruit trees, pecan trees, raised beds, and outdoor sheds.  Our family is living on the land in a pre-loved house.  We have horses, dairy goats, chickens, and ducks.

We are currently seeking one individual or family to join us.  Must have organic gardening and/or permaculture skills.  We will add more families in the coming years.  We are open to RV, yurts, tiny houses, medium sized houses...whatever will fit together into our community.  We hope to have a yurt for a classroom and workshop space some day soon!</description>

We are a cohousing community and plan to build our homes on a small section of Seven Springs, the former girl scout camp.  

Our rural cohousing community will have 25 to 35 individually-owned homes grouped close together and will be designed to maximize walk-ability and sustainability.  Our homes (a combination of single family homes, townhomes, and/or multifamily buildings)  will be clustered around a large common house where our multi-generational and diverse group of families and friends will share common meals and group events.  We also hope to include other cohousing norms in our common house like guest rooms, a large commercial kitchen, a yoga/dance studio, a space for child care, and a workshop.

We also aim to grow our a community of friends and supporters of Seven Springs Lodge and Retreat whose mission is &quot;To help foster a connection between our surrounding communities, the great outdoors, and our State and Local Parks by providing group camping experiences and Leave-No-Trace training close to Winston-Salem, North Carolina.&quot;

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22936&quot;&gt;PermaTree a Holistic Gaia Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; MISSION &amp;amp; VISION
Living a more meaningful and resilient life in harmony with nature as self-sufficient as possible planting our own food and eating healthy.

A community where you can come, share, learn and be inspired for becoming ambassadors of healthy &amp;amp; resilient lifestyle change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/permatree/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/permatree/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;SUMMARY
We (open-minded Swiss &amp;amp; French couple) started in March 2016 created PermaTree a Non-Profit Organization with the philosophy of permaculture which we live by and apply. We are a holistic farm focusing on a sustainable lifestyle by growing and cooking our own organic foods. We build a bamboo house, compost toilets and a river nearby from where we get our water. Half of the land here is a natural jungle reserve so we don’t touch it. Before, the land was occupied with cow farming and so now we are recovering the soil. On Sundays, we go to the fresh market in Yantzaza to buy all the food until all grows within the farm. 

BASE FARM INFORMATION 
Surface area Total - 78 Ha Conservation area - 40 Ha Current Production - 10 Ha Geography Lowest point - 800m above sea level Highest point - 1300m above sea level Soil Type Main soil type - Ultisol - red clay with high mineral content Some areas containing higher OM than others Historically used as pasture land for over 10 years Climate Tropical/Rainforest - Af in Köppen-Geiger classification Rain Season: May - June; Dry Season: July - February Significant rainfall all year, even in the driest months. Average annual temperature in Yantzaza is 22.7 °C; Annual precipitation averages 1959 mm.

PERMATREE
As a community, we wake up together, eat meals together, take turns cooking for each other, and share in the responsibilities of keeping daily operations running smoothly. 

Each community member may have different responsibilities, but we do our best to work together as a cohesive group. Inevitably there are challenges, both physical and interpersonal, but even in these, we try our best to learn and grow from them.

The PermaTree Project is a 1-year old permaculture site in the edge of the Amazonas region of Ecuador in South America. The farm is approximately 76 hectares or 180 acres and located about 3 hours north of Loja, in Southern Ecuador. The lowest part is 800 to 1300 meters over the sea level. Which means we have a high variation of micro climates within PermaTree. It was not so long ago a dense tropical jungle with huge trees, and later in the '60s, half of the property was made pasture land for cows. Lucky us, the fruit orchard is very diverse: papayas, bananas, plantains, cacao, mangoes, bananas, lemons, white zapotes, lulo, guayabas, ice cream bean, passion fruit, sugar cane, and tons of other edibles. 

COLLABORATION &amp;amp; KNOWLEDGE
PermaTree is a place where people come together and create mutual enrichment. Participate and teach/learn from people who share their knowledge. On the other hand, we are always looking for mentors to teach the respective topics which match the specific sub-project. Or visit the farm to get a taste of permaculture in the green. Here we stress collaboration. We are about mutual enrichment and working together. There is no room for people who think they know everything. 

EAT &amp;amp; COOK HEALTHY
Eat healthy, seasonal, local and partially organic food. We eat as much organic produce as possible and harvest as much of our food from the finca as we can. Sundays we go to one of the local markets to buy our food for the entire week. We cook all our meals together.

SUSTAINABILITY 
Learn first-hand what sustainability looks like. Our water is directly from the waterfall. Our house in built from fast-growing bamboo instead of wood or cement. We have no glass windows just bamboo windows and most doors are recycled or made from bamboo too. We have recycled many beer bottles for the shower and toilet facility. We have also recycled used tires for stairs and erosion control projects. All our light bulbs are LED so they use a very small amount of power. One of our showers is heated by black pipes with the sun's rays. All of our grey wastewater goes into a banana circle and then a pond. We have composting toilets and use the compost in the garden. We try to be an education center where many people can learn about all these ideas/techniques and how they can apply them in their own homes. We also have a natural swimming pool which is fueled by the overrun of the main water tank for after hot days:) 

SURROUNDED BY NATURE
At PermaTree you are literally surrounded by nature. We are located at the edge of the Amazonas region in the south of Ecuador with a breathtaking landscape view of the Rio Zamora. The twilight is spectacular on cloudy days. At night you can enjoy listening to the frogs, bats and owls. During the day, if you are lucky enough, you can see eagles very near our bamboo house. Snakes, spiders and moskitos are a part of the ecosystem here. You can walk around the farm which is about +75 hectares or 180 acres. There are several creeks and waterfalls within the different micro climates of the property.

FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AT PERMATREE:
Depending on the season you can find: papayas, bananas, plantain, cacao, ice cream bean, sugar cane, pineapple, guava, lemons, guayusa, hierba luisa (lemon grass type), cassava (yuca), wild cherry tomatoes, corn, rosemarie, basil, thine, aloe vera, vettiver,  neem, noni, naranjilla, zapote and we have been planting guanábanas, mango, avocados, oranges, grapefruits, chirimoya, coconuts, strawberry, maracuya, bread fruit, bamboo (bamboo shoots), macadamia, peach palm (contact), soursop, jackfruit, star fruit and dragon fruit.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22940&quot;&gt;Venus Development Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Self Sufficiency is an absolute critical initiation when stepping upon the stones of the future. We are partnering with those who provide the resources necessary to make this a reality, for all of us, no matter where we are.  
OUR FOCUS:
FOOD, FAMILY &amp;amp; SAFETY

All people everywhere deserve to have the ability to grow and harvest good and highly nutritious food. Reviving the family unit by providing resources for developing simple self-sufficient and sustainable lifestyles. Creating safely balanced environments while ensuring prosperity and providence.  
 This requires our focus to become defined as:

Food Security
Energy Security 
Energy-Efficient Architecture
Pure Water
A Prosperity Plan on the land that regenerates and profits year after year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/venus-development-project/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/venus-development-project/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Venus Development Project has many things to do this year. We will be showcasing some closed farming systems as well as learning to work with the land in a good way. We will be farming sweet grass, hemp, and food. We work with an organization called Living Earth Solutions and they provide us with many sustainable and self-sufficient templates to work with. Our intention is to grow into a learning center that will support the local women's shelter and provide education and training in self-sufficiency to them.  We are currently looking for those who would like to be apart of this property in its beginning stages.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22941&quot;&gt;The Abrahadabra Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Obligatory Disclaimer:
The Abrahadabra Institute is a repository and distribution center for occult-related art, information and technology.
It is not affiliated with the OTO, the Golden Dawn, or any other ritual magickal organization.

• Premise #1:
Every man and every woman is a star.
• Premise #2:
Abrahadabra is an encrypted key to intrastellar transformation.
• Premise #3:
The Physics of the Body of Light is humankind’s surest path to Completion.

These are the core assumptions that define the Abrahadabra Institute. These are the things we seek to validate without reliance upon or commitment to any other religious, philosophical or metaphysical influence. We are determined to arrive at an irrefutable accounting of these core assumptions on all coherent levels, with special attention paid to the underlying physics. If we view these central tenets as an evolutionary imperative generally lost on the vast majority of human beings, it is clear that they will have to be recognized before being acted upon skillfully enough to affect any meaningful change. Since a hugely successful body of work already exists combining over 40 years of investigative research and aggressive experimentation, we are actively involved in the social networking this precedent logically beckons. This networking assumes a healthy range of manifest forms both artistic and academic. Whatever we may do to reach a larger receptive audience, we are steeped in the intrinsic meta-science underscoring this unique star model at every pass. It is important that the Abrahadabra Institute establish and maintain strong connections with as diverse a pool of forward thinking individuals as possible since our unfolding model anticipates overwhelming validation at the highest levels of artistic and scientific expertise alike. We know of no other Body of Light thesis in this world that has any rational hope of achieving this. We have a great many proofs to reveal at present, but the greatest proofs are yet to come.

For the benefit of those who have not heard of Abrahadabra, it is a modern reconfiguration of an ancient word of power purported to be invested with uniquely *magickal* qualities that has been hailed down through the centuries as especially auspicious, particularly with respect to bodily health and vigor. Its true origins have never been completely sorted out but it comes to us in written form via the Roman physician Quintus Severus Sammonicus in the 2nd century A.D. referencing a certain Abracadabra incantation technique (found on certain amulets and charms referred to as Abraxas stones) among the Gnostics. It was said to be successful in the reduction of fevers, dispelling of assorted maladies and was also useful as a spell for returning lost or stolen items, among other things! There are conflicting interpretations as to its meaning, but its geometry has never been in doubt. Formed from 66 letters in 11 sequential rows, arranged with 11 letters at the top, descending to 1 letter at the bottom, we arrive at a perfect inverted triangle of letters equivalent to (but not always strictly displaying) the entire word repeated exactly 6 times. This word can be posited in either an ascending or descending direction. If descending, the word-glyph is thought to have the power to reduce; if ascending, to exalt. It is perhaps the most basic (yet enduring) example we have of *word magick* as understood in ancient times that is still perfectly recognizable as such in modern times.

Aleister_Crowley

While the magickal formula of Abrahadabra does not actually originate with Aleister Crowley, he certainly positioned it for maximum exposure with respect to the upcoming Aeon of Horus. His Liber Al vel Legis (aka the Book of the Law) has proven to be a significant game-changer for occult philosophy in the modern era, where Abrahadabra is linked to praeter-human stars and the corresponding notion of Completion. It is not the province of the Abrahadabra Institute to either endorse or discredit Aleister Crowley with respect to those austerities he declares of himself. That is for his readers to decide as he would almost certainly be the first to insist upon. The Abrahadabra Institute’s official position on Aleister Crowley is that the sum of his work qualifies him as the premier star theorist of his generation. There is abundant evidence to grant him this distinction in our reasonably expert opinion and there are certain topics we may periodically engage that would not be possible without the precedents he laid in. Having said this, it must also be admitted that Aleister Crowley was much better at initiating vital transformational discourse than he was at qualifying his arguments, or even doing an adequate job of presenting relevant facts in their proper order. For that we most often need qualified specialists and there is no shortage of logical holes left hanging in the balance with respect to the conversation of Abrahadabra and its relevancy to praeter-human stars.

Although the Abrahadabra Institute is rooted in the magickal formula of Abrahadabra, its overall mission is by no means confined to this alone. It came online in the Spring of 2002 under the auspices of abrahadabra.com which hosted the (now dismantled) Abrahadabra Forums. Abrahadabra Forums was a grand (albeit tumultuous) experiment in what we came to call open-source occultism where a sacred space was created to discuss Abrahadabra and everything related to it in some apparent way. What we soon discovered was that this magickal formula is amply deserving of its reputation as the *Word of the Aeon* since there seemed to be nothing of merit pertaining to modern occultism that it did not integrate with and contribute to in some distinctive fashion. Literally hundreds of sub-forums were created to keep pace with all the specialized topics people wanted to discuss until finally, after 11 years (and millions of unique hits per month) it was decided that it had ultimately served its useful purpose. Abrahadabra Forums has had a demonstrable impact on the worldwide web and will be missed for the quality of discussions and presentations housed there, but time is of the essence and it is time for us to enter into a more proactive professional phase of networking operations.

This is because the Abrahadabra Institute is in a unique position to impart vital Body of Light principles and assimilation techniques completely unavailable anywhere else on Earth. When we defer to Abrahadabra, we are referencing what we know to be a comprehensive physics of consciousness quite unlike anything that has ever been consciously perfected. Not only are we able to define exactly what praeter-human stars are (based upon its innate syncretic properties), but can also train people with enormous confidence to emulate and maintain that state of physiological perfection going forward in their daily lives. While we are still only at the threshold of the most exciting epoch in human history, the model of Completion that the Abrahadabra Institute is privy to is hands-down the most powerful transformational technology ever captured in this world. So in phase 2 of the Abrahadabra Institute’s networking agenda we are going to be raising up self-initiated stars one dedicated practitioner at a time. We have everything in place to accomplish this right now so there is no good reason to postpone it. There is also no reason for anyone to fear what they might have to sacrifice to embark upon this transformational work since Abrahadabra does not amount to a belief system in itself and does not demand anything in payment for the rewards it has to offer. It is an alchemical projection discipline of the highest order; a remarkably potent visualization practice that is inclusive rather than exclusive. It may subtly change the way you view certain things but that is between you and yourself alone.

There is nothing that the Abrahadabra Institute extols that requires anyone to believe a certain way.
It is the nearest thing to *the method of science – the aim of religion* that has ever touched down in this world to date.

perseverance furthers,

m1thr0s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-abrahadabra-institute/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-abrahadabra-institute/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Ouroboros Lodge, Gallup, NM (was: The Nuit House, Olympia WA)

Greetings,

The Abrahadabra Institute is an occult organization unaffiliated with any other ritual magickal organization, it has been active in the global occult community since 2003 and its founder, m1thr0s, a Hermetic Alchemist who founded the discipline of Mutational Alchemy has been involved in the American occult community since 1970. Our loosely knit organizational structure is a testament to the lack of interest we hold in forming a religion, church or a following. Individualism is very important to us and strikes a discord with many “intentional community” types more often than not, who prefer to be lead. We are leaders but do not particularily want to have people following us around so we take a different approach to membership and followers than most other organizations. In this sense we are more akin to the A.’.A.’. than anything else, which is purported to be wholly universal anyways and requires no strict dogma or even much adherence to any rules but one’s own True Will. This True Will is wholly up to the individual. This makes us attractive to artists and those sick of silly religions, interested in learning together abut the mysteries of the old religions, the occult, new ways of occultism and alchemy, and finding ways to perfection.

Our original house was The Nuit House an Olympia, WA, micro-intentional community intended to be a knowledge-focused community, with little focus on natural living and more focus on an urban artist setting.The house mutated within a year into strictly and artist collective, then back to just occultists, then a mix, then no particular focus at all. Now we’re focused on creating a larger intentional community and focusing on the American cultural zeitgeist that is often embodied in Visionary Art and Nu Aeon technologies. Aleister Crowley’s Abbey of Thelema is a touchstone for us, obviously, as we are called *The Abrahadabra Institute* as are many retreat centers worldwide. Core members are occultists. The Abrahadabra Institute is focused on the formula of Abrahadabra and the Body of Light. (See Isaac Luria, Lurianic Kabbalah, The I Ching, the Tai Tsuan Ching)

We are now located in a great adobe with an adjacent TLC-needed mobile housing unit. We are in the Wild West in a great little city that is also a wordwide tourist destination due to the vast diversity of American Indian tribes and Wild West culture here in historic Gallup, NM. We are two blocks South of historic Route 66 and two blocks from Downtown Gallup. It's a great location for The Abrahadabra Institute, and because we have a secure plot now that is in the family and we can relax into some heavy duty renovations and work. I’m STILL interested in how living harmoniously with other people you’re not related to in an urban enviroment can reduce stress and waste, in comparison to typical urban boxes that only house 1-2 people.

Over the years members have been a diverse mix and I’ve learned a lot about running things smoothly, and am always willing to share my experience in a running a micro-IC in an urban setting with an Arts focus.

People interested in The Abrahadabra Institute should visit abrahadabra.com and get to know our materials available online. Those interested in the house may contact me  For those interested seriously in the Abrahadabra Institute’s work, space can be made but everyone pulls their weight financially in the house, it isn’t a rich guy’s house where you get free utilities and do LSD all day in some kind of utopia. I think some people get that idea, so while that may sound crazy it is necessary to say it to some. I don't even particularily like that idea of community since it smacks of laziness and I do not want lazy people in our organization. In the past in The Nuit House all working class people or students and making life work for us in the best way we can, having fun living together affordably in a harmonious knowledge-focused enviroment. If we have a future it will be because of the generosity and support of people who believe in what we are doing.

Now that we have managed to secure a nice urban plot in a very desirable city located close to tons of outdoor opportunities for rituals and within reach of traditional American Indian peoples who know the ins and outs of Shamanism (medicine ways), we can really expand our occult activities. We’re doing what little we can to try to grow and prosper. It isn’t easy, and I know how hard it can be to start and maintain these things with all of the baggage people can bring into a situation they are not spiritually and mentally prepared for. So if you need any advice in your IC situation feel free to contact me for any reason.

      <name>Cardinal Acres: Intentional Community Start-up</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22942&quot;&gt;Cardinal Acres: Intentional Community Start-up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;From each according to ability and to each based on need.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/cardinal-acres-intentional-community-start-up/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/cardinal-acres-intentional-community-start-up/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Cardinal Acres is a sustainable community comprised of self-reliant individuals who wish to live and work in reverence of and cooperation with the Earth.

Values: Courage, curiosity, empathy, honesty, humility, respect, and wisdom.

Aim: To establish and maintain a community of generations devoted to working in harmony with the Earth and its bounty. 

Vision: To live simply, equally, and compassionately, apart from modern capitalist, colonialized, patriarchal societies. 

The goal of this listing is to find 7-15 individuals or families who are interested in pooling together to purchase around 100 acres of land in Saskatchewan's Boreal Shield. Each individual or family would own 1 acre of the land on which to build their eco-home, collect and store water and passive electricity, raise personal food gardens, and house animal companions. We would work together once our own residencies are complete to begin putting together a community centre consisting of a meeting hall, a childcare facility, grain fields, orchards, a communal greenhouse, a library, a medic/apothecary, etc.

Once we get our foundations down, we would spend much of the day maintaining our own units and &quot;keeping house&quot; and a portion of each day contributing to the community centre, and look at expanding and selling more acres to more individuals or families interested in our way of life.

We could have dinner and a meeting weekly, full moon celebrations monthly, and re-caps and goal-setting annually.

The reason I have chosen the Saskatchewanian Boreal Shield is that it's North enough to not be burning, yet South enough that we wouldn't necessarily be frozen, as climate change progresses. It's also central enough that we might not be drowned when the Arctic melts and floods the seas and Hudson's bay, as well as avoid the radiation and poisoned fish of the oceans.</description>

Although we we are liturgically and theologically an Old Catholic Monastery we are intentional in our commitment to be ecumenical and welcome all Christians within the community.
Our monastery is unique in that it will be integrated in many ways. We will integrate both male and female, celibate and non-celibate, family and single. We will also integrate the various monastic traditions like Franciscan, Benedictine, Trappist, and many others. We will balance contemplative and charismatic, stable (i.e., living in one place) and itinerant (i.e., traveling); solitary and communal; and eremitical and active ministry.

The monastic members will work by farming/gardening, office work, cooking, cleaning, and maintenance of the grounds and buildings. Part of our life will deal with the manual tasks of making the Monastery as self-sufficient as possible to decrease our costs.</description>

We want to create a living space where families and individuals of all ages and Jewish sects will live together, enjoy dinner together daily and share the news of their day. A warm and friendly home where folks can enjoy Jewish holidays and celebrations.  Where the familiar, warmth and heimishness of Jewish traditions can be shared, however, with the nuances and individuality that accompany modern progressive values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/avrahams-tent-the-jewish-intentional-community-of-san-diego/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/avrahams-tent-the-jewish-intentional-community-of-san-diego/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Working together to create a Jewish Intentional community / urban kibbutz in San Diego, where it’s warm and sunny 364 days/year.
We will build a sustainable multi-generational community grounded in the Jewish calendar and Jewish values. Singles, couples, and families of all ages and backgrounds are welcome. We envision a community that feels like home: warm, familiar and heimische (Yiddish for warm, homey, down-to-earth, and familiar).
As a community, we will 
celebrate Jewish holidays and take these opportunities to gather together with our friends, families, and neighbors;
provide creative Jewish programming and education for children and adults;
create opportunities for interfaith learning and partnerships.
The community will have 
-a large common area including an industrial kitchen and eating area that can accommodate 2-3 times the number of all occupants. 
-a large outdoor area for flexible use: gatherings, picnics, etc.
-edible garden
-20-30 “family” units, i.e., 25-60 adults. Each unit:
• has 1-6 people and has their own private “tiny” living space, with their own sleeping, living and cooking areas.
• is expected to a) pay for their living space plus “maintenance” fees that will cover food, cleaning, and more, b) work outside the community, c) contribute certain # of hours per month to preparing communal meals.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22952&quot;&gt;Active Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; No boss but no chaos. We enjoy the life being active, sharing, leaning and teaching together and to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/active-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/active-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a community in Berlin that is proposing to host people. 
The average price is between 200 and 400 including food and accommodation.

It is not a school, it is a community. Everyone can be a student, everyone can be a teacher and we act together to help the outside. We practice music, languages, sport, yoga, taï chi, martial arts, weight lifting, climbing, running, meditation…

No one is obliged to do anything at all, but to respect the basic rules that are no physical or emotional violence; no meat, no smoking, no drugs, no alcohol inside the place.

The price (always including food and accommodation) varies between 500 to pay, or free of charge, and even 150 euros of pocket money to receive, regarding your commitment in the community (what you want to do/offer/contribute to in the practice and what you want to learn/take part in. 
The more you give, the more you commit yourself to practice and learn, the less you pay.
The average price for someone who has a normal commitment to learn and to teach is between 200 and 350 all inclusive. The more you behave like a “classical client”, the more you can expect 500 euros, which is a normal price for a community with food and accommodation.

Meet us, show us who you are and we will propose you a contract and a price to pay regarding your commitment in the studies and the practice that we have in our community.</description>

Seattle is a safe haven city with unique and diverse populations that can early 80% less than the mean income. As a teacher and local for over 20 years myself, I personally feel the strain housing can put on individuals, families, immigrants, and seniors. These populations need safe affordable options with a network of people that come from diverse backgrounds, economic status, and an interest to give back to community.</description>

I am planting annual vegetables as well as perennial greens and food plants. I also grow nectar plants for pollinators. I just bought a wooded lot next door so now have about 6/10 acre. I would love to have a few or more folks assist with building a  house and workshop here, as well as, to plant a food forest and enlarge the gardens. Possibly acquire other nearby houses as a connected suburban - community?  I have no debt. I am a lifelong artist - sculptor - painter.  Potential exists for an art based enterprise or a food based project, a myriad of possibilities is swirling! -  Open to discussions! The site refers to a farm I sold in n. Florida, my first attempt at a shared community... - the land and house I now have is mid - east coast Florida - south of the space center 30 miles or so. I am 63, powerful, strong - spiritual. I - meditate daly and have for 40 and more years, vegetarian, artist, musician, (music studio and acoustic - electric instruments available) Art equipment and tools available.... smoke 420 and drink wine. hoping to find folks who could assist in a project and might invest $ and labor for a shared ownership or long term living arrangement.  Open to anything - including a larger property if others participate.  Now, located in a residential neighborhood - the large back yard is very private and fenced. During most of the year no houses are visible. A mile from grocery and other stores and a nice bike path is available. Pizza delivery is available! Not so, in rural N.

We will try to live sustainably and off grid. Health will be of importance here. That being said the following habits are permitted: alcohol, tobacco, cannabis. It will be a community where there are more guidelines than rules. We will participate in activism. We also plan to be a hub for music, art, and poetry where people can learn and teach others also.</description>

We are cooperating and collaborating in order to maximize our personal and professional effectiveness while  increasing our quality of life and sense of belonging.  Through &quot;think tank&quot; planning we plan to grow out of this house and repurpose or customize a larger community property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/west-los-angles-community-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/west-los-angles-community-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;After many years of searching the world for a community to join, we have regrouped at our launchpad property in West LA and decided to form our own! 

We are kid/pet/LGBTG/musician-friendly community open to all faiths. Our values are progressive, and we are very grounded in practical day-to-day family life; learning to grow as human beings together in a collaborative and loving environment. We are inclusive of ALL-ternative lifestyles and family styles. Burners, makers and activists are more than welcome.

Our home is in Rancho Park, one of the most desirable neighborhoods in West Los Angeles. The main 7-bedroom house is spacious, with 3 full bathrooms and a large kitchen for communal meals. Across the compound-like yard is a garage housing a workshop and a 1 bed/1 bath cottage. 

We are short walk to the Expo line, Trader Joe's, and all shopping, etc at the Westside Pavilion. The Santa Monica pier is just a 10 minute train ride away, and we are in close proximity to both UCLA &amp;amp; USC.

We currently have two rooms available in the main house, and additional rooms will be available starting in July, and are inviting those who are interested to connect with us. 

We aim to be a welcoming, inclusive, family-oriented community house in West Los Angeles. Our mission is to cooperate and collaborate both personally and professionally to maximize our effectiveness and sense of belonging while at the same time increasing our quality of life and making a positive impact in the greater world. 

This is just the beginning. We are looking long-term to acquire and customize or re-purpose a larger community property to accommodate our ever-growing family. All that's missing, is you. 

Come join us.</description>

      <name>Russian house #1</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22962&quot;&gt;Russian house #1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to facilitate transcendent experience and a meaningful way of life, which we call the 5th way. 

Russian House #1 is being built around human development and enlightenment goals. We value freedom and friendship and ready for experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/russian-house-1/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/russian-house-1/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Russian House #1 is a community intended for a consciousness exploration and personal growth. It is a free cultural space and an experimental cultural platform. 
As a community we create:

- a frontier restaurant with home-like concept of food-sharing, human communication, participation and sharing;
- a space for cultural exchange (open mics, exhibition, special food days, movies, celebrations);
- experiment in new economics;
- an environment for personal and collective consciousness studies (riddles and puzzles for the public, breathworks, different meditations, mind-development and self-reflection cultivation practices, mindfulness as a path, Game Mastery as priority approach to life-problem solving)

We want to find a way of making things with harmony instead of profit, 
with creativity instead of consumption,
and with friendship instead of client-customer relationship and social rules.


We are intended to become a Post-non-classical science Center, according to classification of Russian philosopher V. Stepin.
Post-non-classical science is something where the researcher includes himself or herself in the research system and obtains knowledge which is not separated from the researcher. The researcher experiences integration of himself or herself into the World. To comprehend on contrary with a classical science, in this case, means to integrate oneself with everything. 

Russian House #1 is located right on the Russian River. People see it as a mysterious place, where the river meets the ocean and miracles happen here often.

Our main focus is the self-exploration and human development.
In order to cultivate it we do:
-	Experience weeks  (weeks of living and experiencing our community life)
-	Russian Games
-	Breathworks (Rebirthing, Holotropic breathwork, Da-breathing, etc.)
-	Intellectual clubs (salon) each Sunday
-	Special events and talks

Our methods can be united with the name of  “breakthrough psychology”.

We welcome everybody for our programs.</description>

      <name>Emberi</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22963&quot;&gt;Emberi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Changing the system within which humans live, to improve their condition and protect our world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/emberi/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/emberi/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We seek to CHANGE THE SYSTEM.

We believe that the single biggest problem in existence today is GREED.

Emberi (&quot;EM-bur-ee&quot;) is a Hungarian word meaning &quot;the condition of being human&quot;. Right now, the Human Community of Emberi exists only online, but at some point it will have to become established physically.

We seek people who are dissatisfied with the way the system works - people who have a deep and well-thought-out desire to change the system, and the world. The Emberish system will inevitably become the way of the world sometime whether we make it happen or not - the only question is, will the transition be smooth or will it cause the eradication of most of the human race?

We seek to make it a smooth transition. The current system is responsible for all of the negativity experienced by humans of all types, and it is untenable. Someday the non-renewable resources we currently call &quot;wealth&quot; will run out, and the system as we know it will cease to operate. If this transition occurs abruptly, which will happen if change is not started now, most of the human race will die - either from starvation or from the widespread pandemonium that will erupt as soon as people become aware that they won't be able to obtain food easily.

We operate by the Four Emberish Principles:

PRINCIPLE 1 (The Preservation of Humanity Principle): Do nothing to any other person, directly or indirectly, which causes that person undesired harm or negativity.

(This Principle is ABSOLUTELY never to be violated unless your very survival depends upon violating it in an emergency situation, even if preserving it means you violate other Principles. They are all subordinate to Principle 1.)

PRINCIPLE 2 (The Golden Rule Principle): Treat other people in the same way in which you would want to be treated if you were in their exact same situation.

PRINCIPLE 3 (The Communal Living Principle): Contribute to Emberi according to your ability, and take from Emberi only as much as you need.

PRINCIPLE 4 (The Goodness of Humanity Principle): All humans are to be considered GOOD by nature and treated as such.

(When they do &quot;bad&quot;, which nearly all people do today, it's because of having been programmed badly by the current system, which Emberi seeks to change and will eventually change.)

The only acceptable violations of any of these Principles will be due to complete accident or unintentional oversight.

We seek people who are passionate about changing the system, to join us and help us cement the system that will be best for all humans going forward. Find our Facebook group and join up there, to be part of the discussion about the best way to improve the condition of humanity going forward.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22964&quot;&gt;The Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The focus is on sustainability and self-sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-project/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-project/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;So far I am a single person hoping to find others who share my dreams and goals.  The hope is to form a small community, 5 to 7 people, that work to become self-sufficient.  Complete self sufficiency is probably not attainable but I want to be as close to it as possible.  I believe we are heading into rough times, economically and socially, and want to be in a position to survive regardless of how things go.  This is not a survivalist community nor even prepper.  I work off site, interact with the community around me and want those outside connections and support but not have to rely on them for survival.  
The project has two properties.  The residential property is a fairly remote, quiet, peaceful place where one can let go of the stresses of the day.  The other is on a maintained road with electricity and is more of a work space.  Each property is five acres.  
Some shared activities, campfires, meals, work projects would be expected but folks would be, if they chose, free to be fairly independent.  Hopefully different members would have different areas of expertise but would train the others so that every member would have a wide set of skills and no member would be the only person capable of any one task.</description>

2. Grow a respectful, gentle environment in which children, adults, and seniors alike can interact, learn, and thrive

3. Encourage affordable home-ownership and common space ownership, with a sense of personal and group responsibility

Vision:

Our vision is to foster a peaceful, inclusive village that will grow deeper community roots for those living within the village, the surrounding neighbors, schools, and the entire town of Waxhaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/waxhaw-coho/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/waxhaw-coho/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are currently a group of parents living in the Greater Charlotte and Upper SC areas looking to create a multigenerational cohousing community in the burgeoning farm town of Waxhaw, NC.

We're planning to put a mix of cottage-style single family homes and duplexes on 3-7 acres of land. It will be walkable to virtually all major amenities, allowing for seniors and families to reduce their car usage.</description>

principles of participatory decision-making and problem solving. Each member
contributes his/her talents to enable personal and community well being as well as
care of the environment.

Our community will include about 30 eco-friendly residences. Each household will
have a private kitchen as well as access to shared facilities in a Common House with
a large kitchen and dining area where we can cook together and share meals several
times a week. The Common House will include meeting spaces and workspaces
where we can share tools and talents. Gardening will be available to the extent the
site allows and maybe in nearby community gardens. Pets will be welcome. This will
be a tobacco/smoke free property.

Our Values

o Welcoming to all
o Interdependence
o Mutual respect, support, compassion
o Community and privacy
o Stewardship of the environment
o Healthy living
o Sustainability
o Emphasis on alternative transportation
o Active participation in the surrounding neighborhoods
o Containment of construction and operating costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bassett-creek-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bassett-creek-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Bassett Creek Cohousing is a forming community of 4 households.  We began focused on an area in Minneapolis north of 394 called  Bassett Creek Valley. That area no longer seems feasible  We now are searching for an urban site in the twin cites. Our hope is to find a site for 25-30 homes in a 3-4 story building close to some urban amenities - transit, library, shops.  We want to be a multi generational community.  We operate with Sociocracy principles.</description>

The property is adjacent to Porter and Davis Squares and about one mile from Harvard Square. The Boston Transit Red Line is available at all three squares and the Green Line extension will be coming to Powder House square - which is a walk away. We will have underground parking and access to the community bike path. There will be some retail spaces that possibly could generate revenue to offset HOA costs. We will have common space and the units will be small to moderate size.</description>

We do not kill any living creature and teach others the act of non-violence (ahimsa). We strive to minimize or cause no harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/peaceful-village-and-intentional-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/peaceful-village-and-intentional-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Peaceful Village is an intentional vegan community and blueprint for creating a peaceful world. Concept started in 2014. We had a temporary land in Belize in 2017 and will reassemble in the near future. Our aim is to create a peaceful vegan community and world and create blueprint for people to create their own communities. If you would like to help with this project in any way please get in touch with us at peacefulvillage@protonmail.com

Mission
At the Peaceful Village, our aim is to create an eco-sustainable community, another way of living, a just and peaceful world through vegan education.

Michael Lanfield
Certified World Peace Diet Facilitator, vegan advocate, and author of five books, including two Amazon best-sellers; The Interconnectedness of Life and The Journey, Michael has garnished 15,000 YouTube subscribers, and 5 million video views and millions more through Facebook, Google+, Instagram, and others. He has written the forward to Mango Wodzak’s newest book The Eden Fruitarian Guidebook.

The basic values for this community include:
 
1.  No being is viewed as property, to be used or harmed in any way, whenever possible. We at the Peaceful Village at Finca Del Soul cherish all life, therefore everyone is vegan while living on or visiting the land. We follow the principle of “ahimsa” or harmlessness where we refrain from injuring any living creature and cause the least harm whenever possible. This includes refraining from the consumption of animal foods and products that contain animal ingredients, as well as, animals used in entertainment, for testing, clothing, or other uses, as much as possible and practicable. We value all animal’s freedom; therefore, we do not participate in the keeping of companion animals “pets” at the Peaceful Village, but rather live harmoniously with naturally free roaming animals in nature.
 
2.  We value every human animal equally and reject all forms of discrimination. We treat everyone as we want to be treated, with kindness, love, and respect.
 
3. Not to take what is not given, but to respect the property of others. At the Peaceful Village, we refrain from taking the property, life, time, or life-energy or others if not given freely directly to us.
 
4. Not to engage in sexual misconduct. This refers to any action of body, speech or mind that sees another as an object for our own self-gratification or against another's free will.
 
5. Not to lie but to speak the truth. We avoid telling falsehoods or exaggerations, internally or externally, through any deceitful action, word or thought, with the intent to harm others.
 
6.  Not to consume alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and cigars. We at the Peaceful Village believe in order to be at peace and harmony, we need not consume any substances that negatively affect the heart or mind.
 
7. We respect nature and avoid using harmful chemicals, minimizing our ecological footprint as much as possible. Therefore, we implement veganic permaculture practices in harmony with the Earth.</description>

We want to live light in a small eco-footprint, but live large surrounded by the people we care for. Our goals are to stretch, grow, reach out and give back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/high-point-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/high-point-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;High Point Cohousing will be a cohousing community of creative adults who want to live, work and grow together in the inspiring environment of a small urban setting. We hope to develop work-live spaces where we can be makers and doers, while living in a small eco-footprint. Nearby amenities such as High Point University, High Point Hospital, sports centers and small businesses supplement an international furniture market and a vibrant, diverse community of residents. Ours will be a caring community that welcomes elders, millennials and in-betweens who want to explore healthy living, creatively working and graceful aging in community. The City of High Point is affordable and on the verge of revitalization. It is small enough for friendly, easy living, but large enough to meet all residents' needs. HP is also close to other major cities, has an international airport and an Amtrack stop, along with parks, walking trails, shops and galleries. Old factory lofts and vacant textile mills are waiting for us to retrofit into cool live-work spaces where we can grow and maximize our potential while living the best of our second or last third!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22983&quot;&gt;Cool Creek Cooperative Neighborhood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Create and sustain a neighborhood that respects individuality, provides the strength of community, and thrives through cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/cool-creek-cooperative-neghborhood/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/cool-creek-cooperative-neghborhood/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Cool Creek Cooperative Neighborhood is located just south of the village of Mesa, Colorado, on the north slope of Grand Mesa 33 miles east of Grand Junction.  It is an area characterized by stunning natural beauty and diversity, fresh air, abundant water, and easy access to public land.

In 2012 a group of friends began discussing ideas for a neighborhood that embraced the qualities of the area but envisioned a different way of living there.  A vision took shape that combined the best characteristics of rural living with the value of a highly functional community – natural beauty, environmental quality, and neighbors who care about the common good, sharing resources and working together so that everyone can live more simply and sustainably.  This common vision led to a plan to create Cool Creek, a cooperative neighborhood that would offer a healthy balance between personal life and the benefits of community.  

The neighborhood is situated on a 9½ acre parcel of land.  There are 10 private lots that collectively occupy approximately 2½ acres of the parcel. Adjacent to the house lots there is a common area of approximately 1½ acres where various shared resources (gardens, orchards, tools, multi-purpose building) will be located.  The remainder of the land (~5½ acres) will be left as open land to be enjoyed by all residents.  Mesa Creek runs through the property, creating a rich riparian area that provides a wonderful place to walk, cool off, and listen to the sounds of moving water and wildlife.

Cool Creek is surrounded by a diverse landscape that includes pasture lands, scrub woodlands, forests, wetlands and streams.  The area is home to a wide variety of wildlife and relatively few people.  From the neighborhood there are panoramic views in all directions, highlighted by Grand Mesa, Castle Rock, and the Roan Cliffs.  The neighborhood is near the village of Mesa (walking distance), while also being close (a few minutes’ drive) to Powderhorn ski area and Grand Mesa, described as “the world’s largest flat top mountain”.  

While Cool Creek offers many outstanding physical qualities and recreational opportunities, it offers something more vital and increasingly rare in today’s world - the opportunity to participate in a cooperative community, where neighbors work together and share resources so that each person can live more fully and sustainably.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22984&quot;&gt;Bullimah Community Co-operative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Bullimah Community lives and operates with respect for each other, the wider community and the environment. We strive to live free, peaceful, healthy lives with responsibility, compassion and generosity. We will work towards social and environmental justice, and resilience to social, climate related and food security issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bullimah-community-co-operative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bullimah-community-co-operative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Bullimah Community is a group of individuals who have come together to find a common purpose, to build our lives in the way that we see fit, and to live those lives together. We came together during many discussions, conversations and meetings during 2015/16 and decided on the Bullimah property in the village of Nymboida, NSW as our chosen place of residence. The property is owned by several friends of the group, and we intend to purchase it by mid 2017 and begin work making our homes here. The group has used a range of activities and techniques in our meetings to discover our commonality, our shared values, where our dreams and visions overlap and the ways in which we would like to live together. We have begun a long process of interweaving our lives to create an integrated, strong and harmonious community.
We envision a cohesive, strong but small group working on the property and locally, and weaving our lives and livelihoods into the Nymboida social fabric. We aim to support and provide infrastructure for craftspeople, artists, gardeners, food producers and other income streams and pastimes. One of our main aims is regenerative farming and organic food production.
The Bullimah property is comprised of 210 acres (84 hectares) of rolling hills, creek gullies, escarpment cliffs and dry sclerophyll bushland. It is located behind the village of Nymboida and has direct access to the heart of the village via Church St. It also fronts onto Armidale Rd on two boundaries. 
	The community will be made up of 13 shares, divided into two hamlets. The northern hamlet will be settled on a large north-facing hillside directly behind the village. It will be made up of 9 approximately half-acre (2000m2) shares, each with a building entitlement for one house. There is one existing house and a shed which will be refitted as our community house, with more buildings and workshops planned along with a shared laundry, shared orchard and garden, grazing land and other infrastructure.
	The southern hamlet will be 4 half-acre shares situated on a gentle north-west facing meadow on the southern part of the property. These shares will be held in reserve until the community decides the number of residents should be increased (to help balance the demographics, welcome new families, provide income or other reasons).
	The existing infrastructure includes a 4 bedroom house (which may become a community run bed and breakfast), a workshop shed, a campground and events space, mains 240v power, phone line, gravel driveway and fencing, as well as three dams.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22985&quot;&gt;Join us Irmgard Gouda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Evolve by working together in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/no-name-yet/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/no-name-yet/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hi there,

We are a couple in our thirties. Raising our first beautiful baby boy. We are making progress buying land in the south of Chile. To start a community of like minded and very open minded people that have a strong desire to become free from the matrix and all the strength an individual must have to make that happen. We are looking for people that are comfortable sharing on a spiritual basis consistently and can easily open up their deeper levels, just as much as they are enthusiastic about working together on the land. We look for people who understand the value of living mimalistically and can help to set up a permaculture area and focus on self-sustainability. We have enough savings, good will and understanding to bring an area and a garden to life, but also to remove the inner blocks on anyones personal consciousness (and thus practice perma-culture of the human mind as well). 

To live in the light is the same and more important than to achieve the physical ´live off the grid feelings´. Thought we would very much like to work together with you to achieve both goals. It is important that our efforts do not attract a false copy of this consciousness form so you as an individual will be seen and screened and expected to behave honorably (and/or as far as our understandings of it takes us). We have strong abilities to also emplify your existing gifts to higher levels of understanding as we are both very often considered high energy people that are appreciated for sharing insights and feelings. We would consider teaching you and your friends if that is the way the best energies flow forwards. We would gladly take on the younger generations in a non-committed capacity, meaning: Staying with us on a free basis to share interests and bring focus to our shared experience and other things these current times brings us as humans. 

Be different and try us out. 
Greetings and Love, 

Esmee &amp;amp; Greg


PS: Looking for friends, members and visitors :)

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22986&quot;&gt;Visitation Residents Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are a intentional Christian community living alongside the Visitation Sisters in North Minneapolis. We are committed to the gospel principles of prayer, community, recreation, silence, contemplative presence, conversion, and hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/visitation-residents-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/visitation-residents-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;In response to a readiness that we perceive in our hearts and in our lived life, the Sisters of the Visitation Monastery of Minneapolis are seeking to found a Visitation community of the laity alongside the Visitation vowed religious community. Both of these communities are called to minister mutually within the universal church of all believers while living mutually in prayer and community with those less advantaged, embracing and sharing God’s abundance and living Jesus with the joy of being loved by God.

In the spirit of Francis DeSales and Jane DeChantal the Sisters of the Minneapolis Visitation have been oriented toward collaboration with lay groups since the founding of their monastery. Many different endeavors over the years have included: Visitation Neighbors, Visitation Companions, Circle of Leaders, development of leaders in the neighborhood, St. Jane House, Visitation Intern Program, Monastic Immersion Experience and Following the Spirit Discernment Series.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22987&quot;&gt;Bohemian Utopia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are committed to the ideas of shared labor and resources, inclusion, open mindedness, acceptance, non judgment, mutual aid and support, egalitarianism, open and respectful communication, consensus decision making, non-violence, and harmonious and simple living.
  
We are accepting and inviting of a wide range of alternative lifestyles and peoples (atheists, pagans, agnostics, wiccans, pansexuals, LGBTQ, polyamorous, sex positive) and expect all members to be equally accepting. You do not need to be or share in any of these, but you do need to be respectful of other’s choices.

To that end we are seeking members whose own beliefs, opinions, and ideologies are not so strong that they prevent you from getting along with others who may not share your views. We prefer members who are open minded, non judgmental, liberal minded, progressive, and accepting of other’s views/beliefs/lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bohemian-utopia/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bohemian-utopia/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;***Please read the entire community description 

We aim to achieve a better life for each member through cooperation, collaboration, and communal effort- together we can achieve more than any of us could individually. We believe that by working together in a shared vision each of us are better able to have a life that is less stressful, more enjoyable, happier, healthier, and of deeper intrinsic value. 

While we do not as a rule exclude anyone for their beliefs/ideologies please understand that we are not a religious/spiritual, ecovillage, or back to the land movement based community. We’re looking for bohemians, intellectuals, poets, hippies, burners, beatniks, philosophers, free thinkers, free spirits, nature lovers, and wild souls.

We’re especially interested in members who want to live in a supportive community of like minded individuals where the exchange of ideas, intellectual discourse, collaboration, and meaningful interaction contribute to personal growth and community. 

If you think you’d be a good fit and are interested in our community contact us and let us know a bit about yourself and what about our community that interests you.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22989&quot;&gt;Wilder Waters Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission statement is to establish and maintain an eco-centered community that allows sovereign humans to experience healthy social interactions, deep connections to the landscape, and sustainable living in a manner that reinforces our biological and ancestral norms and honors the need for humans to interact in a cooperative manner with other wild beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/wilder-waters-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/wilder-waters-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We began Wilder Waters Community here on 150 acres of forest in central Maine—a real community, based on our ancestral birthright to a deep connection with each other and the land. A community where we share food, but also other types of nourishment: songs, stories, and rituals. Where the economy is based on reciprocity rather than extraction. Where the nuclear home is replaced by the community lodge, and life is lived according to the principles knit in your bones.

We were all physically, emotionally, and spiritually sick of living in opposition to our ancestors-- living without community. That's why we began Wilder Waters Community on 150+ acres of forest here in central Maine. We are a small tribe of people who wish to disengage, to the extent possible, with the stress, lack of empathy, and ego-centric living presented by the dominant society.  We feel best when outdoors and sharing real living experiences with our community members.  While there is much to be sorrowful for, we are happy, vibrant, and have a strong positive outlook for our living here in the mountains of western Maine.  

Currently, there is the original solar-powered house where we do most of our social gathering, group meals, and food processing. The main house has two bedrooms; one, which will be occupied as of January 2018 by a couple and the other, which is currently vacant. Surrounding the main house is mostly forest and there are 2 occupied living structures (1 yurt and 1 cabin) and an additional 5 or 6 spaces where small living structures can be built. We will cluster our homes so they are close enough to not fragment the landscape but far enough to feel a sense of privacy as we adjust to communal living. We currently have a small cabin for people to come live in before they decide to build a structure of their own.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22990&quot;&gt;Campus Cooperative Residences Incorporated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are a student housing cooperative focused on providing Toronto area students with affordable, democratically controlled, socially just,and environmentally responsible housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/campus-cooperative-residence-incorporated/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/campus-cooperative-residence-incorporated/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Campus Cooperative Residence Incorporated (CCRI) is a student housing cooperative consisting of 24 houses with 7-15 members each. The houses are beautiful historic Victorian era homes located in pleasant residential neighborhoods near the heart of downtown Toronto. All are within easy walking or bicycle distance from the University of Toronto, Ryerson University, OCAD University, and George Brown College. CCRI members work to sustain a non-profit organization that upholds values of community, responsibility, and awareness while providing them with affordable and environmentally sustainable housing.  Members are expected to contribute their labor to both their houses (cleaning, cooking, other house chores) and to the organization as a whole (service on committees, social and educational events) through a co-op hours system.  Members are also expected to participate in the democratic self-governance of the cooperative. CCRI has four venues of democratic governance. A general membership meeting consisting of the entire membership is held once every semester.  There is an elected Board of Directors and committees dealing with varied special topics. Members can join committees devoted to special topics such as member recruitment, environmental sustainability, and formulating new policies. Individual houses hold regular house meetings and elect house officers. We are currently striving to establish more vibrant democratic communities at the level of individual houses.

Our co-op began in 1935, when four University of Toronto theology students ventured south to Indianapolis, Indiana, in the United States, during the Christmas holidays. They attended the biannual conference of the Student Christian Movement, a left-wing Christian group that promoted cooperative development as an alternative to both capitalist exploitation and Marxist revolution during the Great Depression. There they heard a speech by Christian minister and labor activist Toyohiko Kagawa. Kagawa is famed for his tireless advocacy of cooperatives, both in his native Japan and in North America. His speeches in more than 150 cities in the United States and Canada were an important inspiration of the North American student housing cooperative movement.  Inspired by the Kagawa speech, the students founded a twelve man housing cooperative in 1936, named Rochdale after the English founders of the cooperative movement. Another early house was named for Kagawa. By 1942, the co-op had grown to 101 members and had added its first women's houses. The co-op continued its growth throughout the 1950’s and the tumultuous 1960’s. In the ‘60’s it was noted for its social conscience and its connections to the era’s vibrant counterculture. Although the co-op suffered from declining interest in cooperative living from the 70’s and onward, it is now entering a period of renewal. We seek to attract members with a strong cooperative spirit; something that is just as necessary to the challenges of our new century as it was to those of the 1930’s.</description>

      <name>Perth Ubuntu Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22992&quot;&gt;Perth Ubuntu Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; If it's not good for everyone, it's not good at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/perth-ubuntu-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/perth-ubuntu-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are at present a community of roughly ten individuals from various parts of Perth, Western Australia. We have meetings every week, but as yet have no location in which to start building a physical community. We are part of the worldwide Ubuntu movement, which you can Google, or watch numerous videos about on Youtube. Our goal is to create a world free of money. Money has enslaved the human race for 6,000 years, and we will never be truly free, until we are free of money. If we can get just one Ubuntu community up and running, this will show the world that we can not only live without money, but that we can live BETTER, without money. Once others see what is possible, it will start a domino effect, and other Ubuntu communities will form. In the startup phase of building the physical community where the first 1,000 of us will live, each member would contribute 3 hours a week to community projects, such as creating the gardens, energy and water systems that would form the basis of a community where we could live off the grid, in an ecologically sustainable manner. Putting in just 3 hours a week to start, would allow you to continue your job (if you have one) and other normal activities, until housing has been created at the community. In return for your 3 hours a week, you would receive food from the community garden. In Ubuntu, no one is paid in money: they are paid in food, water, electricity, accommodation, healthcare, and education... all of which would be made available as needed on a permanent basis, to those living in the community (once appropriate dwellings have been constructed). Those living in the community would be expected to work 3 hours a day on community projects, plus 3 hours a day on their Labour of Love. Your Labour of Love (LOL) is whatever you WANT to do, as long as it something that contributes to the community. It is called Ubuntu Contributionism, because everyone must CONTRIBUTE something - it could be anything, from gardening, to painting, to meditation classes, whatever you're passionate about - in order to receive the benefits. So, all in all, you're only working 6 hours a day, and it will be on whatever community projects (there will be a wide variety available) and LOL you CHOOSE to. The remaining 18 hours each day, you will be FREE to do whatever you wish, and you will be surrounded by people who love and support you, because the people you work alongside will be your friends and neighbours. Even your 'government' (the Tribal Elders) will be your friends and neighbours, who you can speak to at any time, to ensure that your interests will be taken care of.

If all this sounds good, I strongly recommend you watch the video: 'Ubuntu: A World Without Money' on Youtube. At only 15 minutes long, it's the perfect 'crash course' introduction to Ubuntu... and once you've watched that, you'll have a long play list of other Ubuntu videos to browse through, if you wish.

I'm keen to hear from anyone who has an interest in Ubuntu, even if all you can contribute is your presence and enthusiasm at the weekly community meetings... but I'm really hoping a wealthy investor or land owner will stumble across this. Although the ultimate goal is to create a community (and eventually, an entire world) without money, the sad, ironic reality, is that it will cost a great deal of money to build the thing in the first place. Money AND land - if you  have either, we're desperate to hear from you. Maybe you don't have much money, but you're a farmer with a decent-sized property, who'd like to be free of economic and government systems and their nonsensical, tyrannical rules. In  which case, you could give us some of your land (as much or as little as you like) to build our community - or a community garden - on. If we had an actual community on your land, you'd get free water, electricity and food (possibly also healthcare and education, if you needed them). If we had only a garden, obviously, you'd get a share of the crops to sell, in exchange for letting us use your land. You could be a full member of the community, or your arrangement with us could be similar to WWOOFING, but on a permanent basis. Contact me if interested, and we'll work something out.</description>

Our 'mother ship' is Canticle Farm, which is comprised of six adjacent houses with fences removed between 36th and Harrington Avenues. Inspired by the life of  Francis of Assisi and the Work That Reconnects as taught by Joanna Macy, Canticle Farm provides a platform for the Great Turning – the planetary shift from an industrial-growth society to a life-sustaining society – one heart, one home, and one block at a time. The Farm manifests a commitment to living and working towards more sustainable alternatives through spiritual practice, integral nonviolence, gift economy, restorative practices, urban permaculture, education and other work necessary for regenerating community in the 21st Century.
The neighborhood is largely Latino. Amor Art Farm and Manantial de Luz (formerly Casa de Paz) are just up the street. Our intention is that as we grow in number, we will house folks through renting/buying houses in the neighborhood.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22996&quot;&gt;A__ Rogue River Eco Village Destination Resort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Rogue River Eco-Village Destination Resort (RREVDR) is a state-of-the-art sustainable living paradise experience that integrates innovative permaculture design in Sustainable Living, Green Businesses and Sustainable Eco Tourism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/rogue-river-eco-village-destination-resort/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/rogue-river-eco-village-destination-resort/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;First-of-its-kind, The Rogue River Eco-Village Destination Resort (RREVDR) is an iconic eco-village destination resort in development in southern Oregon to create an up-scale off-the-grid, sustainable green “smart grid” community of 450 green homes and green eco-businesses using the best green architectural designs and system technologies available.  An elite team of top system engineers, green architects,  permaculture designers, landscape architects, solar &amp;amp; hydroelectric  developers, renewable energy consultants and advisors, hydrologists, geologists, water resource engineers and green business developers are assembled into one of the most innovative green think-tank engineering coalitions ever created.  A unique green Home Owners Association and 23 Anchor Businesses are integrated into the first of its kind eco village destination  resort in USA.The RREVDE is located on 2,110 acres in some of the most spectacular rural, undeveloped land in southern Oregon, Jackson County between Central Point and Gold Hill on a beautiful scenic bend of the Rogue River.  Herds of wild elk roam this undisturbed rural land.   This land is only 5 minutes from Interstate 5 and 20 minutes from Medford and yet is it in rural undeveloped land that has a diverse range of topography-- meadows,. timber, wetlands, creeks, river.

The RREVDR Water Distribution Design is one of the most spectacular water harvesting and delivery engineering designs created.  The primary water delivery originates with an all natural rock channel coming off the historic wild and scenic Rogue River with a beautiful intricate distribution of rock bank water canals integrating with seasonal creeks, collection ponds, wells, natural reservoir lake, storm run-off catchment areas, storage channels &amp;amp; storage tanks and rain cisterns that are all integrated into a “smart water delivery grid system” with overflows designed for instream return back to the Rogue River. All the RREVDR systems are integrated into the innovative water distribution system design.  The Hydro-Electric and Solar Power systems, Water Treatment Filtration system and Potable Water Delivery system, Grey Water Recycling system, Living Biological system, Organic agriculture system, Agro-forestry, Gardens, Orchards, Vineyard, Green-houses, Aquaponics and Eco-Ranch are all integrated into a “smart water delivery grid system.”

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22997&quot;&gt;KindaVillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The concept is simple…

    Find a core team of intentional community members who have a PASSION for social or environmental purpose and the ability to maintain the facilities and activities of KindaVillage.
    Work with these people to create the intentional community hub as a platform from which to develop the community and social business activities of KindaVillage.
    Find individuals or groups of people with a good idea for a social or environmental business or project and the ability, PASSION and commitment to build it into something real.
    Provide them with the right facilities, support and funding to turn their social and/or environmental dreams into a reality
    Celebrate their achievements when they successfully make the world a better place!
    Share their knowledge with others to create and support more KindaVillages for our network
    Watch the movement grow!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kindavillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kindavillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;10 years ago it was a vision. 7 years ago the seeds were sown at the Missing Sock UK Charity. 2 years ago experimentation commenced!

Today, the vision is clear…!

As part of our global aspiration, the time is NOW to set up the first KindaVillage; an intentional community ecovillage project for those with a passion to serve social development.

We have just bought 80 land (STC) in Ceredigion, Wales, for our community and hope to settle in the autumn 2017.</description>

      <name>Order of Tiamat</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22998&quot;&gt;Order of Tiamat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; 1. Enable the individual to follow their true will in harmony in an alternative commune that provide them with social and financial support to help them reach this.

True Will is defined as the essential identity, passions, and motivations of an individual once they are stripped of cultural and social conditioning, mind-control, and the modern mindset and necessity to focus on materiality and survival at the cost of everything else.
In exchange for contribution to the development of the Order, individuals will be granted access to some of our resources to use to achieve their higher goals.
​
​2. Function as a sanctuary away from the unsavory aspects of the modern world, while maintaining connection with the more positive aspects so that the fruits of technological and scientific development can be harvested and that we continue to progress forward in all forms of evolution, rather than retreat into previous ways of being.
​
Among other pragmatic aspects of life, we aim at settling all of our willing members together in the same location so they may actualize themselves through social interaction, art,  intellectual work and other collective endeavors.
​​
3. Work to protect and preserve the natural conditions of existence of all living creatures on earth, and to ensure the preservation of the ecosystem for future generations. Contribute to the development of alternative technologies to improve our quality of life, and our knowledge of nature as part of the greater whole.

​4. Evolve as a center for the sacred where the transcendental center of every individual is activated so that all individuals experience the &quot;life that cuts through life&quot;.
​
Many understand the basic modalities of interacting with the world and oneself as feminine and masculine. In other words, they consist of love and will: receptivity to higher realities, and knowledge and skill to mold them. 

Magic practice and the perception of the &quot;sacred&quot; consist of the means, structures, and traditions of apprehending and interacting with a broader range of realities than are generally glimpsed by the uninitiated public. Through it, we can envision Source (the Divine) in its plane of existence, interact with higher dimensional beings in the ethereal plane, and produce thought-forms on the astral plane that will chisel the world around us to reflect our True Will.
​​​
5. Advocate for the rights of the seer, mystic, psychic. Educate the public about the esoteric and its proper place in social life.
​​
6. Create an interdisciplinary center of research for culture. An intellectual salon where important and heretical thinkers are studied with the purpose of achieving greater understanding and capacity for affecting change. A place for the consumption and creation of arts and philosophy that transcend time.

In light of the fragmentation of disciplines in modern academia, we represent an alternative to dissociated hyper-specialization in research. The subjective world, the world of spirit, has been neglected in pursuit of science and technology. The purpose of this center is to merge science, in all its advanced forms, and spirituality, by rigorous research to unravel disciplines that have barely been explored, including Integral Theory, psychoanalysis, and esoteric studies. We want to investigate myths and miracles to see what truly is possible, and to stretch the human to its full potential.
​
The methodology and goal of this center are to merge science and spirituality.
​​​
7. Enact meta-political and trans-historical social change to bring metaphysical revolution based around philosophical principles and a higher form of spiritual action.
​
​8. Restore spiritual sovereignty and ancient knowledge. Study and practice a variety of esoteric, shamanic and occult disciplines in great depth, with a combination of individual and group workings.

We combine witchcraft, shamanism, ceremonial magic, theurgy, neoplatonism, kaballism, Tantra, and other sometimes lost traditions with the goal of helping humanity transcend its limited condition and awareness, and broadening its connection to higher densities. 
​
​​9. Bring people together who've attained transpersonal levels of awareness. Help as many individuals achieve enlightenment/awakening as are ready.
​
The first truly transpersonal stage of awareness is stage 7 in Ken Wilber's terms, where limiting postmodern values such as pluralism, egalitarianism and hyper-individualism are replaced by a structure that favors a more nuanced understanding of self and development of hierarchy. To our knowledge, all existing public spiritual communities in the US are centered around the sixth stage of development or below.​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/order-of-tiamat/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/order-of-tiamat/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Order of Tiamat defines itself as a multidisciplinary spiritual community.
 
We are a growing group of eclectic individuals passionate about spirituality, real politics and exopolitics, holistic science and ancient knowledge, actively involved in both substantial and non-conventional change. We are in the process of creating a residential community which will serve as an alternative to the modern Western world: a crucible disconnected from the burdensome perspective that present-day civilization is heading for collapse and desperately trying to feed us with its own illusions and decadence --individual, social, economic, moral and environmental.
 
Countless alternative social projects like the Order of Tiamat are being spontaneously created and independent communities are emerging right now in many countries. However, our core values and ideals often deeply differ from the mainstream ones one can witness mostly everywhere nowadays.
 
Some of us are artists and thinkers, some seers, some scientists, visionaries or revolutionary activists, some
world travelers. We are looking for genuine, resolute, engaged souls who are willing to commit to a long-term collective project that demands mainly responsibility, insight, strength, relational skills and a fine taste in avant-garde production.
​
We are convinced that individual and isolated acts cannot change the upcoming global crisis the false elite of mankind is working for, and that the main responsibility of those who seek, like us, to embody and preserve what can be saved of earthly humanity's freedom, dignity, knowledge, tradition, and wisdom is to collectively prepare our transition from this age to the next.
​
Today, whenever you examine the different spiritual forces and beings trying to bring their contribution to the enlightenment of mankind, a constant and almost stunning reality appears: nearly all of them are profoundly isolated. If, for instance, you investigate the presence of shamans online and around you, most who are truly knowledgeable and devoted to the spiritual path for its own sake are separated from others pursuing the same goals. Although our enemies are partially responsible for this situation, it is also our own complacency, weakness and lack of faith that distance us from our responsibilities and power in this world.
 
This split results in every single person committed toward enlightenment having to exert an incredible amount of energy for minimal gain; if more unity were achieved, tremendous results could be accomplished almost effortlessly. Society as a whole works collectively with many roles delegated to execute a single purpose; yet those who wish to change the status quo tend to break off from others and to disregard the importance of collective action. humans have many different personality types, talents, and aptitudes, which serves to remind us that even if individuation is a mandatory yet often neglected aspect of spiritual growth, our final cause involves creatively merging with others to be more fulfilled, and successful. 
 
This perspective in mind, one of the central objectives of the Order of Tiamat is to move human cognition to a higher level of non-ego based self-realization fed, stimulated and encouraged in and by the pursuit of wisdom, justice, compassion, truth and constant enlightenment.  On a collective scale, we aim to accomplish this end through subversive inspired art, authentic activism, revolutionary spirituality, and transpersonal expressions of awareness.
 
Our influences, interests, sensibilities and sources of inspiration include both modern culture and ancient civilizations, Traditional forms of spirituality (neoplatonism, shamanism, traditional witchcraft), esoteric thinkers (such as Nietzsche, Evola, Lao Tzu, Plato, Steiner) and the ideals of the Ubermensch, Guardian and Warrior.
 
At this stage, it is still too early to precisely determine where we will establish ourselves, and all viable options - including outside the US - are being carefully considered. This being said, we are currently thinking of spanning a major city and its nearby rural location in either Washington State, Idaho or Montana.</description>

Started by four families, it has grown to 13 homes with close connections to the wider neighborhood. Eight families, known as DayStar, own their home and homesite, with adjoining land owned and maintained in common. Another five homes, DayStar Too, across the street are on adjacent lots with a shared alley driveway. We enjoy monthly potlucks and celebrate the summer solstice with an annual progressive dinner. We share a vegetable garden area, fire pit, tools, parking area, yard chores, and an open grassy commons. Front porches welcome us home each day and gently connect us with neighbors.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23000&quot;&gt;Housebus Helios and Lolin Farm Cohabitation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We look toward building a better life for ourselves and the world by going back to simple living. We want to produce our own food or buy it locally, and we want to produce our own power as much as possible. We also look forward to helping found a sustainable community that positively impacts neighboring communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/housebus-helios/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/housebus-helios/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hi there, I'm Alys. I'm one of two members of Housebus Helios. We're parked with a budding intentional community (pop. 6 besides us) on a large organic ranch in Arlington, WA. Currently we're helping the owner of Lolin Farm and their community members build cabins with a central kitchen/shower/bath building. We're also clearing out a few spots for short-term camping areas and rebuilding walking forest trails. 

We rent a spot in the woods on the far side of forty acres, away from the central hub. While the two of us can do what we like on Helios and our small plot of land, the landower has the ultimate say with the rest of the community. 

Helios is a 2001 New Flier transit bus. We're renovating the inside and plan on having solar panels and a battery bank (right now we run a genny.) We've built a composting toilet in an outhouse and installed a woodburning stove for the nights when insulation isn't quite enough. We have plans for a drill well for fresh water so we won't have to haul it; luckily we're parked on a small creek and won't have to dig deep. The inside of the bus will be furnished with recycled wood, flooring, and other materials-- we spend a lot of time finding second-hand furniture and tools. 

Our family also includes two dogs, Mac and Trigger. They've adapted well to living on the bus; both have always loved riding in cars so there wasn't much adjustment to go through. They get as much time as possible running around the woods with us, hiking, and swimming. The landowner has several working dogs, including a rottweiler that herds her beefalo cattle. There's also a flock of chickens for eggs and meat.

The land itself has glacial creeks running through it, an apple orchard, tons of wild mint, a plot of raspberries and natural blackberries and salmon berries. Whatever food we don't get from the land is available locally and often just down the street. 

We spent the summer living on various campgrounds but none of them had offered what we'd been looking for-- a diverse community that we can be a part of long-term and that has the same goal that we do towards a living sustainable lifestyle within nature. By lucky chance Lolin Farm found us and it is more awesome than we imagined. It's not huge, but forty acres of paradise is enough.</description>

Where community makes sustainability fulfilling and fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/spokane-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/spokane-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Spokane Cohousing formed around the opportunity to develop a beautiful 3 acre property in the South Perry neighborhood.  It's on a bus line. The site is within walking distance to the neighborhood business district, bike trails, and parks.  Over the past 30 years the current property owners have restored the historic home, built a beautiful, green apartments, and cultivated a large organic garden which we plan to preserve and expand on. 

We envision an  intergenerational village that is close to down town Spokane. With clustered townhouses and flats to maximize efficiency, interaction, and green space. Where we share skills and facilities where it makes sense and respect privacy and independence where it is needed and desired. We right size our lives to limit our ecological footprint. We strive for a  decision making and group process that is inclusive, as simple as possible, and flexible.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23002&quot;&gt;Brave Sparrow Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To provide a space for those interested in practicing sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/brave-sparrow-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/brave-sparrow-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;OK people, here’s the deal - I have 20 acres of rural undeveloped property. I repeat UNDEVELOPED property.  There are no buildings, or infrastructure of any kind. This land has been vacant for several years, and it’s time to put it use, so I thought why not an ecovillage.
 This village/community is just now forming, so I could use some help in establishing the ground rules. I figure the village can determine for itself what restrictions and freedoms it’s willing to permit.  Basically, I just want to start a dialogue with some people interested in forming a village from the ground up. My initial thoughts were perhaps allotting each member/family a certain amount of space for their own dwelling and agricultural pursuits, perhaps a half acre or even a full acre, along with access to some common acreage.  
  I really don’t want to charge anything for membership to the community, but it’s possible that could change in the future based on community consensus.
    As the owner of this property, I have the obligation to ensure it used responsibly. What that means is I have final say in anything that takes place on the property. Don’t worry, I’m not some kind of control freak that wants to control everything – far from it. I believe in the adage “Live and let live,” and I’m sure the community can come to decisions by themselves.
  Like I mentioned earlier, I would like to start a dialogue with people who may be interested in helping to establish an ecovillage from the ground up. I am specifically interested in ideas you may have about housing, community projects or anything else you may want to discuss.
  There is no infrastructure on this land, but there is water and electric at the border of the property, so getting connections should not be a problem if that’s what you want/need. I haven’t spent much time on this land since I was a kid, but at the time there were two fresh water springs on the property, and I’ll see if I can’t locate where they were and take a few photos.
   I will be posting photos on this site along with some youtube videos soon so that you can get idea of what the property looks like.
  Don’t hesitate to email me with questions or comments.</description>

      <name>Nissarana</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23003&quot;&gt;Nissarana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; A community of lay Buddhist practitioners who are looking to deepen their practice together. While meanwhile living together with nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/nissarana/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/nissarana/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We, in the Western world, live in a way, at least most of us, that is not conducive to practice. We are bombarded with imagery, with false ideals and persuasive marketing. Especially for us beginners it is difficult to remain mindful for a day, let alone remain mindful for a few hours. Times have changed, for better or for worse, but I think it is quite obvious, that we need to reassess our living conditions if we want to deepen our practice.

This has triggered me into thinking about different ways to live, ways which are more conducive for practice. Ways which actually enhance practice. And that is were Nissarana comes in.

TOGETHER ALONE

In my mind Nissarana is community of likeminded people who are willing to practice together, but also at times alone in noble silence. Nissarana will be a community at heart, in which to share and learn, but where there is also space to take time for yourself, to go out for a personal retreat, if that is necessary.

In this modern society there are less and less ways to live, especially if this is 'Religiously' inclined. Of course, nowadays it is still possible for a Buddhist practitioner to go into 'homelessness' by joining a Monastery.

Though there seems nothing 'in between', like a community for lay practitioners. Who are at the start of their spiritual careers, who would like to follow their own path.

Nissarana should not be like a monastery, in the sense that there are strict guidelines. There is practice, but practitioners are solemnly responsible for their own development and in a style in which they would like to practice.

DIFFERENT KINDS OF PRACTICE

Residents form a Sangha, but everybody works individually on their own practices. There is freedom to pursue your own path within the Buddhist framework. There is a common practice, like meditation, discussion and study, but this is really ones own responsibility.

The community and the philosophy is based on that which all Buddhist practitioners have in common, Noble Truths, Eightfold Path, Five Precepts etc. 

One should also be open for different kinds of practice, have respect for different Buddhist approaches, early or late Buddhism. Different Buddhist approaches have developed by interaction with different cultures, one way of practice might work for one person, but might not work for the other. In Nissarana we will look together for the approach that will fit us best. 

REMOTE BUT NOT SECLUDED

An important aspect of Nissarana is an open and compassionate attitude towards other communities at large. If we can start and build this community we are privileged. Therefore we should give back. In whichever way this will be I am not yet sure, this should be discussed together with the future community. But I think the possibility of a personal retreat should be open for everyone.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23008&quot;&gt;Mac An Ghaill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The location of Solares in Cantabria a few miles from Santander is a placeholder.  We are not yet certain where we will build, but it will most likely be in either Catabria or the Basque region, the easternmost regions on the Costa Verde on the northern coast (Atlantic Ocean coast) of Spain.

We are planning a sustainable, cooperative community with a view to wellness and caring about our neighbors.  The geographic area we are considering is a very temperate area of the world – moreso than most temperate regions – with summer high averages in the low 80s (F) and winter low averages in the low 40s (F).  It is green and beautiful, with substantial mountains rising not far south of the coast, plentiful rainfall, and fertile earth.  We believe that it will be fairly immune from the worst effects of global climate change, with air and moisture fed by ocean currents not closely associated with thermohaline cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/mac-an-ghaill/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/mac-an-ghaill/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We intend to have a community focused on sustainability, but in style.  Specifically we will be welcoming those of open-minded, egalitarian and free-thinking persuasions who care about others and wish to live in peace and harmony.  This is likely to be a well-planned community with architecture and housing commensurate with a resort-like atmosphere, clean and as upscale as we can afford.  “Anything goes” planning will be avoided.  We may be using alternative building materials such as compressed and interlocking earthen blocks and/or “air-crete” and/or “hemp-crete” or others, but in traditional style such that we do not stand out like a “sore thumb” to Spanish society.  We will not be a commune, but we do intend sharing in pursuits.  We will welcome some portion of our residents who are without much in the way of resources, out of compassion, as far as we can afford … and we will be able to afford far more than we can in the US because of significantly lower living costs and because of ability to “buy in” to the very excellent and affordable Spanish national healthcare program after a year in residence.  We plan to have sufficient land and flexible building concepts which can accommodate expansion as needed and as warranted.

We look forward to providing very affordable and comfortable housing (as compared to the US) to all, some of which will be as apartments with central gathering areas, and some of which may be single family or multi-family dwellings.  Common areas for gardening and community efforts to grow our own food is a central goal.  The pursuit of alternative energy sources is also an intended goal.  A business or several businesses which will help support the community and employ residents and Spanish nationals are planned and at least the main one(s) will be focused specifically on saving copious amounts of energy in commercial and industrial applications.  Plans and patents are being drawn up currently, and the practicality of the business models is beyond much doubt.  As soon as patent application filing is done investors will be sought to underwrite the startup expenses, but the profitability outlook is great considering that the ROI for customers who buy the products and services will be stellar –  they will pay for themselves within months or certainly less than several years.  The market will be the whole of the relatively temperate and humid portion of continental Western Europe and possibly England.  There is currently little competition, and that which does exist will likely be outshone by our offerings.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23009&quot;&gt;Sedona-Oasis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; A community to bring like minded souls to live together harmoniously with the land in a sustainable manner using eco-friendly earthen building techniques, permaculture, alternative energy sources to eventually be fully off the grid.  I envision Sedona Oasis and the surrounding landscape to be a seamless integration of living spaces, event spaces, and nature itself. I see it as an educational forum so others can learn from our collective vision. A place for visitors to enjoy farm to table meals, raw chocolate making, the wines of the area, yoga, meditation, ecstatic dance, and simply connecting with their highest and best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sedona-oasis-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sedona-oasis-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;After being in Sedona for 16 years and owning my own tour company for the last 13 years, I know that Northern Arizona is my home. For this land is purely magical, enchanted in fact. The way the rocks glow at sunset, the people that make up this vibrant community, the sacred waters the flow through Sedona. This town and area have everything that makes my heart sing with joy and gratitude.

For several years I have had a dream. My dream? I wish to start a collective of like-minded souls. Let’s bring our conscious intentions, love, grace, passion, together! For alone I’m just a single man, but with other like-minded souls, we can create something really special. In my vision, it’s called “Sedona Oasis”. It’s a community for the people to live together in harmony. A place where we can grow our own organic food together. Where there is such an abundance of food for not only ourselves, but also a surplus that we can supply the Sedona Foodbank, and offer local restaurants and wineries an organic food sources.

A place where we can build earthen structures to inhabit, living simply, using the materials from Mother Earth whether it be cob, strawbale, hempcrete, adobe, rammed earth, sand bags. A place where we can practice yoga, meditation, community cuddles, and any other forms of self improvement arts freely. A place where we can come together to dance our heart’s dance, sing our soul’s song, simply be. I see gardens and pyramid shaped greenhouses. I see an orchard of grape vines. Yes, I would like to follow in the footsteps of my great grandfather and make wine and also sell grapes to neighboring vineyards. I see an abundance of fruit trees. I see animals: dogs: cats: chickens, goats, ducks, perhaps even a horse. I see a heart-shaped pond on the property with a gentle red rock waterfall flowing through the property. Tucked in-between the trees are pathways to communicate with nature and yourself. I see hammocks, swings, yurts, and hobbit holes throughout the property.

I see a small youth hostel where budget-minded travelers can stay for under $20 a night. I see a small bed and breakfast where other travelers can stay and get to enjoy organic meals made on premises. I see a magnificent kitchen and community area where we can gather. I see an incredible commercial chocolate making the kitchen, where we can host chocolate making gatherings and workshops. I see an opportunity to form a co-op to bring an abundance of superfoods to not only the community but to the public. I have a vision. I have a dream. This vision is so close to coming to fruition: The land is there. 5.6 acres just minutes from west Sedona. there’s a well already present. The property borders national forest and is in an ideal location with views of the red rocks and Oak Creek.</description>

Our position is that cohousing communities are not synonymous with inward-looking gated communities. We will always reach out to the wider community, and look to build connections with other intentional communities around the world through existing international networks and direct contacts, and we see this work as part of the global network for a fairer, sustainable society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/a-fairer-society-sussex-and-kent/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/a-fairer-society-sussex-and-kent/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We’re a cohousing community working in partnership with ethical property development company A Fairer Society Homes (AFS). Our vision is to create affordable, beautiful, ecological homes on a land plot in Sussex or Kent, and we’re looking for new members. Our unique community name has yet to be decided.
 
Our model of cohousing provides each household with their own private home, whether that is a studio apartment or a 5-bedroom house, situated adjacent to a community centre (‘common house’) with shared facilities. These could include a larger kitchen, an event space, guest bedrooms, a laundrette, and other amenities. This is a community-led development, which means we, the people who live in the property, are playing a leading role in developing it.</description>

We currently live on a 26-acre off the grid permaculture homestead producing beef, dairy, eggs, poultry, vegetables, fruits, nuts, medicine and wood for heat.  The neighbor's land is 52 acres, mostly fallow pasture, a gorgeous year-round creek, old furnished farmhouse, well, outbuildings, sun deck and glassed-in porch with wood and oil heat.  We are seeking a family, couple or cohesive co-housing group (&quot;Farming Partners&quot;) to live in our neighbor's house and partner in farming one or both properties with us depending on interests and experience.  The Farming Partners would be expected to pay utilities on the farmhouse ($200/mo, approx), provide maintenance and some repairs on house, and share house with owner who is only present 20-30 days per year.  Farming Partners could develop their own farm venture or partner with us in row-cropping, dairy and meat production toward self sufficiency, or develop a permaculture perennial herb farm at our property.  This could become an affordable for-profit farming venture for experienced farmers or a turn-key opportunity for rookies to leave the rat-race and farm a rural property under the guidance of two experienced off-grid, permaculture farmers (30+ combined years farming).  We intend to have close community relations with Farming Partners as land and infrastructure on both properties would be shared, and ideally, meals, equipment, childcare, transportation to town etc. would be shared also.</description>

The Eco-Community will provide a socio-cultural support structure as well as a healthy atmosphere for living and working. For community members, fair work, cooperation, and an abundance mentality replace the materialism, competition and scarcity mentality prevalent in today's world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/8thlife-panama-ecovillage-collaborative-work-life-initiative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/8thlife-panama-ecovillage-collaborative-work-life-initiative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;*SEEKING CO-FOUNDERS* 
A collaborative work-life initiative forming an intentional community in rural Panama based on permaculture ethics, respect, peace &amp;amp; living an “on-purpose” life.

THE PROJECT – Come create community. 8th Life Panama is a permaculture-based Eco-village Project in the early stages of formation. We’re designing our intentional community to provide a social support structure and a low impact lifestyle for our members, residents, volunteers and guests. We envision an intentional rural community where the values and ideals of community, respect, peace, and living an “on-purpose” life will be rediscovered by the diverse, multigenerational group of people who’ve joined us. We are currently seeking founding members and experienced permaculture volunteers.

THE REASONS – We can live more lightly. As human beings we weren’t designed to live disconnected from nature and each other. As a society we’ve gone astray and as a result we’re damaging our mother earth and soon she won’t be able to sustain human life. We seem to have also lost the ability to relate with one another as human beings. It’s time to transition from a destructive society to a sustainable world. We need to stop the destruction, build soil, restore ecosystems, heal our addictions, change organizational structures of the global economy, &amp;amp; learn to live in community.

THE LAND – Be a steward and protector. Our Eco-village land, Finca Astoria, is 21Ha of grasslands and forests bordered by a river and stream. When we bought the land, it was in its natural state apart from 1Ha that’s been farmed on occasion. The finca is located 11 km from the town of Antón Panama, where we have our operations center. Villa Astoria is our co-working, co-living center in the town of Antón. It is an operational guest house, receiving travelers, digital nomads and volunteers and other project participants. We work and live here while designing the Eco-village.

The Initiative has two physical components, Villa Astoria Guest House - the operations center, &amp;amp; Finca Astoria - 21Ha of land for developing the EcoVillage. We envision incorporating a number of elements such as:

    *intentional community eco-village based on integral permaculture design principles (on Finca Astoria)
    *eco-enterprise incubator, shared workspace for eco-community members &amp;amp; volunteers (at Villa Astoria)
    *artisan &amp;amp; craftspeople's incubator, shared workspace, &amp;amp; storefront for eco-community members and local residents
    *promoting and strengthening the local economy of our neighborhood and the town through example
    *training/workshops in eco-economics, the circular economy, 'buy local', and local economic development
    *community gardens and local produce and artisan markets
    *permaculture courses and other practical, hands-on learning experiences such as eco-building</description>

It is a project with many options and many layers. It is scalable between one ecological farm only to a complete rural EcoGay village. It works for creating an online community, which in turn also means it can easily be duplicated in other places as well. The main thing is that we need to connect first to make things happen.

We want to get in touch with gay men who agree that people need to treat our planet with respect. That we need biodiversity and natural function at the center of our thinking. EcoGay is modelled after ecosystems and aims to build resilience by focussing on people in all their functions and abilities, guided by cooperation rather than competition.</description>

      <name>Family of Friends</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23024&quot;&gt;Family of Friends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; opening our hearts ~ eco living ~ healing/growing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/family-of-friends/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/family-of-friends/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Main Post:  (see bottom of post for Intro Retreat experience) (to get more of a feel of me, see my Youtube channel 'Troy Schacht':  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjb57gm1uuWY3nshswrBZnw?view_as=subscriber)

My vision is to have four adults (2 women, 2 men, and possibly a couple children) who share much in common living together as a family.  I'm looking for a very special mix of people who are interested in evolving toward the possibility of a close, long-term, intimate connection that feels right for everyone involved.  My passion is around bringing healing to the world through transparency, emotional release/healing, emotional intelligence, and promoting sustainability.  I like the idea of building trusting friendships and living together (since this seems to be the best way to really know someone) before even considering a more intimate relationship.  My name is Troy Schacht ~ I'm a single, straight, 47 year old male and have lived on Kauai for the last 8 years. I own a 4 bedroom / 3 bath spacious home on 2 secluded and quiet acres in the Wailua Homesteads.   We have good WIFI; good cell phone reception; washer/dryer/clotheslines to air dry; full kitchen; bathrooms complete with bathtub and shower; venting skylights/white roof to keep it naturally cool; double garage; single garage used as workshop; high ceilings for hanging aerial silks,etc; garden; fruit trees; creek around back; kayaks and bicycles; etc. I'm open to an exchange that feels good for everyone involved. I worked hard for what I have and believe that society works best when everyone wants to contribute to the whole. I'm also open to friends buying a share of this home so we can be co-owners. I have no desire to be &quot;above&quot; anyone because I am the owner, but do believe in fairness and will take appropriate action to safeguard the values of this group. Everyone will have a say in how things go ~ your say is weighted by the energy that you contribute. We will make decisions by consensus as long as this maintains a healthy dynamic.

The traits which I would like to share are:

~ we're open, honest, peaceful, aware, mindful, have high integrity, and enjoy heart connections

~ we're sustainability minded ~ I have a vegan diet and support that ethic ~ we embrace a joyful, deep, simple lifestyle; we believe in permaculture, organic gardening; we have a deep love and respect for nature and the earth ~ we have a sense of awe about the many miracles of nature and love in our world; we take good care of things so they will last; we reduce waste

~ we don't get lost in religion, spirituality, or conspiracy theories; we seek truth and contributing to improve the world; we have respect for science

~ we're healthy, fit, and active

~ we don't smoke anything 

~ we like to live in a clean, organized, and clutter-free space

~ we like the quiet and do our part to contribute to it; we are OK with wearing headphones when listening to music, etc.; we enjoy an ecstatic dance, etc. once in a while so we can all enjoy some music together; we embrace gentleness, close doors quietly, etc.; we are not people who like to have fans on, except for once in a while when it's really hot or humid, but definitely not all night

~ we enjoy sharing meals, heart sharing circles, efficient family meetings, etc. and also enjoy our own space

Future projects: adult jungle gym type area with travelling rings and ziplines, treehouses, solar heated hot tub, outreach to promote a healthier world, etc.

My frustration with community building comes from a desire to find a collective truth when it seems that most people are locked into their individual truth.  To me, in order to find a collective truth, we need a rational, balanced outlook that considers the various influences that shape a person's &quot;truth&quot;, an awareness of the pros and cons of a &quot;truth&quot;, and a healing of emotional perspectives which lock people into a &quot;truth&quot; which has been shown to be unhealthy.  I understand that it's all complex with many unknowns ~ I just wish people could be more open to a process of going toward the truth and healing, instead of separation and dysfunction. 

If interested, we need to build a trusting friendship before I will invite anyone to live here. Depending on the level of trust, there may be a security deposit and a trial period. If you leave and have taken the appropriate responsibility, your deposit will be refunded. The first step is to email your full legal name, age, sex, and brief thoughts.  My username on facebook is Troy Schacht in Kapaa, HI ~ feel free to send me a friend request and join my facebook group &quot;Family of Friends ~ Healing Ourselves and Our World&quot;.


INTRO RETREAT EXPERIENCE:

I (Troy Schacht), would like to host from 1 to 4 people at a time for a short term Family of Friends intensive.  This is not a business to make money, but rather a way to connect with those who share much in common and may become good friends.  It's an all-inclusive retreat and I'm charging just $40cash/day/person (due the day before) to cover my costs plus a one time $100cash refundable deposit.  Duration will be as long as we both want to continue.  This retreat is designed for those who are:
- 30 to 50 years old
- align with the traits listed above for Family of Friends
- considering the possibility of some day joining the Family of Friends
Possible activities tailored to interest:
- exploring various attractions on the island
- heart sharing circles
- hiking, bicycling, swimming, kayaking
- tours of my backyard/garden
- ecstatic dance
- stretching/exercises
- emotional vulnerability/healing
What is included in this &quot;all inclusive&quot; retreat:
- bed and share rest of home/2 acre yard
- one vegan meal per day (I usually eat just one vegan meal per day) ~ any other food is your responsibility; you're welcome to eat what I have (I do take precautions of washing, freezing and/or cooking to eliminate Rat Lungworm risk)
- transportation (I have a Nissan Xterra which seats 5 ~ only I drive)
- use of tandem mountain bike, single mountain bike, single beach cruiser, 2 tandem kayaks, a surf kayak, snorkel gear, boogie board, etc.
If interested and you sincerely think you are a good fit for this, email me or connect on facebook.

Thank you and much love to all!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23026&quot;&gt;Casa Colibri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Guanajuato Cohousing is forming a group whose members seek a sharing and caring bilingual, bi-cultural community, whose aim is:

to live comfortably and economically by sharing a fully-equipped communal house bordered by private cottage/duplexes .

to pledge their generous support to one another

to provide a secure home base from which to explore and gain appreciation of the culture, customs and traditions of Mexico

to live in harmony with the surrounding community of Guanajuato&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/casa-colibri/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/casa-colibri/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Small community of 12-16  adults ages 30-70, couples or singles. Located in an ecological zone eucalyptus forest on a ridge-top above the city of Guanajuato with view on one side of the city below,  and a reservoir on the other. Communal house  built on one level ready for easy conversion.  Is currently 3 bedroom/2 bath with large living/dining, fully-equipped kitchen, laundry room, storage, garage/workshop with studio apartment above, several outside terraces, parking areas, fenced.  All wheelchair accessible with ramps.  Small central patio with fountain, covered with a Lexan dome. On-grid electricity, rain-water capture and grey water systems, LP gas, back-up gasoline generator. Ample land to build individual, private duplex cottages with private backyards near the communal house. Herb/flower gardens, extensive xeriscaping.  10 minute drive to supermarket and pharmacy, 20 minutes to town center.  City bus stop 10 minute walk.  Pets allowed within policies that will be established by the group. One difference from conventional cohousing: due to the rules governing land subdivision in an eco-zone, members will own ALL of the land and buildings including the cottages through a non-profit corporation.  Members will own shares which can be sold (under conditions contractually outlined by the group) rather than their individual cottages. Costs of building and costs of living are considerably less than the U.S.

We're looking for emotionally-mature, dependable, considerate people who appreciate good food and wine, music and the arts, and stimulating conversation in a relaxed, low-key atmosphere, who would enjoy sharing their skills, knowledge, and experience for the benefit of our community: who have lively minds and a calm demeanor; who are active listeners, compassionate advisers, and respectful of the natural environment.</description>

The group generally follow a low carb, high protein (LCHP) approach to normalizing blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/healthy-t1d/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/healthy-t1d/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a group of families and individuals who follow Dr. Bernstein's dietary guidelines for achieving normal blood sugars even with impaired or absent pancreatic function. While this group is primarily focused on people with type one diabetes, it is open to family, friends, and those with type two diabetes who are also following Dr. Bernstein's methods. 

Individual members and families live in their own homes, although some may choose to live in shared housing if desired. Everyone in the community recognizes the challenges that we go through to act as an external pancreas for ourselves or our loved ones. We offer emotional support and a wealth of communal knowledge to each other in times of need, such as during illness, stress, growth spurts, unusual exercise patterns, and other challenges of management.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23028&quot;&gt;Laughing Frog Gardens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are motivated by multi-generational cooperative living, openness and curiosity, and ecological sustainability.  We are interested in folks joining us who like hard work, like to see projects through, and are responsible and self-motivated, with a primary interest in cooperative gardening and the possibility of shared business.  We are hoping to meet people who want open and kind communication with mutual respect for others and the shared spaces and this land, and who have love and motivation for sharing work and building together, and a joy in seeing each other's individual growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/laughing-frog-gardens/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/laughing-frog-gardens/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We live on 32 acres of wooded land in central Missouri, 30 minutes north of Columbia. Columbia is a vibrant college town with lots of opportunity for cultural activity and education.

For the past eight years we have developed organic permaculture/forest/kitchen gardens that have supplied about 90 percent of our fruits and vegetables for 2 people. They are rich in native and cultivated annuals, perennials, fruiting shrubs and trees. We also have chickens for our eggs.  Our intention has been to foster a healthy ecosystem of plants, insects, and animals as a model of small scale integrated sustainable agriculture.  

Currently we have a small business on Etsy making rag rug looms, but would love to develop more cottage industry that can support a household through income sharing. Some other things we have done from the land is sustainable education and small farmer's market sales. 

 There are 3 lots, 2 of them could be built on, with purchasing as an option, or used to extend agricultural needs, and sleeping cottages could be built.  For now, new people would need to camp or otherwise provide their own shelter, and their own food.   The best fit would be folks who are passionate gardeners, the gardens and chickens managed cooperatively.

Though the house is a conventional house, we heat with responsibly selected wood and retrofitting is a possibility depending on the financial structure that the community sets up.</description>

Sharing our skills and experiences, learning from one another, respecting and appreciating our differences, finding our gifts and talents and using them to help the community.
(In a nutshell)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-old-home-place-apiary/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-old-home-place-apiary/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I've been wanting to do something like this for years..not that I don't enjoy healthy solitude and silent time..on the contrary.  And I have amazing friends from all walks of life and fortunate to have family, close.  However, living in the country and trying to  homestead a little here and there and seeing so many amazing projects in prepping, survival, bushcraft, beekeeping, gardening, etc. I've come to the conclusion I need a villiage.  Most are settled in their homes and lives and have no need to travel or seek housing.  They are already living their dream or seriously pursuing it.  But if you're like me, you're still figuring it out.  Last year, my best friend and I started this journey.  He was just going to build me a little chicken coop which turned into a chicken house, then two.  Together, we acquired guineas, a rooster, chickens, and bees.  He loved being the maintenance man, every repair he could make, he did.  We worked side by side steadily from March 2016 until October 2016 when he fell ill.  March 2017 he was diagnosed with cancer.  Though his heart is still in it, he simply cannot continue working, though he probably won't stop.  He has this great airliner camper.  He's going to hang out here and boss me around lol.  I have focused on the bees.  It's the best hobby I could have.  It's good for the soul, along with gardening and any outside work.    I spend a lot of my time reading and learning what I can about bee biology and the art of beekeeping.  This is my 2nd year and I have been so fortunate.  I hope to expand my bee yard even more, next spring.  I've made several splits, sold some, gifted some, kept some.  It looks like I will be going into the winter with 7 hives.  I harvested more honey than I expected and even rendered my first beeswax from all the wax cappings.    We accomplished so much and had plans for so much more, here on the hill.  It's nice and quiet here.  Except for the guineas and a rooster.  There's a creek that runs through the property, a lot of wooded areas, valleys, hills.  I've got one of the best views of the sunrise and sunset.  Seven miles from town, however, you're within an hour drive from Tulsa, Fayetteville, Bentonville, and Eureka Springs.  Many artist and musicians live in the area.  I love my hometown and this is my grandfather's land.  He was an ole timer who loved the simple country life.  It takes years to accomplish all that he did.  But together, we had a modest garden, fresh eggs, and what I thought would be the start of a little homestead.  There are a lot of wooded areas here on the hill and I love the art of bushcrafting.  Not that I'm good at it, but I want to learn many survival skills, along with that. I would love to see someone or group skilled in bushcrafting come and build primitive camping spots, teaching the art.  I'm also looking for individuals who love music and art, love to garden, skilled in herbal medicine, experienced in animal husbandry, butchering,carpentry, homemaking, organizing/starting up small communities, retired beekeepers, active beekeepers, creative and kind people who would enjoy working with others to achieve common goals; safe, clean, peaceful and recreational place to live, clean local food to eat, like-minded people to share in the work and the fruits of our labor.  I think there are a lot of people like me that have come to the realization, &quot;It takes a village.&quot;  I am willing to open my home and share my land with those who are willing to share my vision.  If this sounds like something you're interested in, this may be the &quot;village&quot; you're looking for.  Perhaps you're not experienced or super skilled in these particular areas but you are an amazing person and have something to offer and want to be a part of this kind of community, your gift will make room for you.  One of my closest friends and her 2 are coming at the end of September.  She is going to school for parks and recreation management (or something like that) and this girl can do amazing things with wood.  She's super motivated, organized, and hard-working.  I don't know what this &quot;community&quot; will look like in 6 mos - a year but I'm optimistic about the possibilities.</description>

Where we will live simply 
With peace and kindness 
In beautiful, environmentally friendly homes
Around our common house.   
Living Simply.  Nurturing Others. Enjoying Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/alpenglow-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/alpenglow-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ours will be an intentional neighborhood where we have people who we can celebrate with in good times and who we can count on in hard times.  Combining the autonomy of private homes with the advantages of community living in a ‘’resident friendly” setting, we plan to create a socially and environmentally sustainable lifestyle, and cluster our homes around a Common House. Our founding members came together in 2016 to plan a multigenerational cohousing neighborhood within walking distance of  Ridgway, Colorado. We intend to live cooperatively and sustainably, sharing resources as we care for each other and the environment.

Our site planning committee is working hard with our architecture firm and cohousing consultants to design our neighborhood.  Currently plans are in the works to build 900, 1200, and 1500 square foot homes,  ranging from 1-3 bedrooms.  Current members are reserving their homes and participating in the neighborhood design.  5 of the available 24 units have already been claimed!  Investing now, will save on the final cost of your home.</description>

We are growing an intentional living community targeted to age 50+ LGBTQI people, friends, family, and absolutely welcoming to others who may choose to live in this community or who live nearby. Part of the vision is to share friendship and support within an accessible, low-maintenance setting and never have to move again. For those who do not want to move, but who live nearby, the vision includes building neighborhood-based intentional community.
The housing is located within a group of 12-unit new construction condominium buildings in Boulder County, Colorado. The initial condominium building is part of a larger, existing new home community. All units are high-quality 2-bedroom/2-bath condominium flats with green building features. The buildings are elevator served; all units have private garages. 
We have six initial member/buyers in the first 12-unit building, now under construction and expected to open in February 2019. We are seeking renters for 2 leased units in that building and buyer-members for the next building, now pre-selling. Condominiums are purchased directly from the builder for cost-efficiency. Eventually, there will be five adjacent 12-unit buildings - with some units sold to those seeking intentional community with us, and some sold to the general public.
INTENTION/VISION
Our vision is a diverse housing and neighborhood-based community that enables us to enrich our lives through friendship, cooperation, sharing, and mutual support. We choose to share our lives to build a community that will sustain us both now and for the rest of our lives. The housing and community model will encourage positive connections while honoring personal privacy. Through connection and cooperation, we believe we will be able to better meet economic, social, political, and health challenges with creativity and resilience.
Community Intention: Values
We are seeking buyers for whom this community vision is a good fit with their personal vision. Potential buyers should share these community values:
•Value and seek diversity in his/her/their friendships and housing community
•Have a desire to participate in community and share time and resources
•Value both community and privacy, and seek to have a balance between the two
•Honor individual differences and support the uniqueness and growth of each person
•Respect individual beliefs and encourage diverse traditions, celebrations and explorations of the spirit
Community Intentions: Actions
•Celebrate life together by having fun, laughing; eating and playing together
•Provide for and respect personal boundaries
•Find ways to share our time, skills and resources to save money and ease each other’s lives
•Give appreciation and encouragement to each other
•Take responsibility individually and communally for our actions
Community Intentions: Plan for Organization and Governance
Because we are buying into buildings that are inside an existing larger community, we will fall within the covenants and HOA that is part of the larger housing development. For our intentional community, we are beginning without a pre-determined governing structure or additional covenants. It is our expectation and desire that our core group of first buyers decide initially what informal and formal structures we will have for our community. We will also decide together if, when, and how we will dedicate some common space for gatherings and perhaps an extra guest room for our visiting friends and family.
THE HOUSING
We are creating our small community within a larger, new home community in Louisville, Colorado in Boulder County. The builder has an excellent reputation and has been in business locally for 40 years. The larger housing community has been under development for several years and the site for the five condominium buildings is now under development.  
The housing is located within 3-story, accessible, elevator-served buildings with 12 two-bedroom/two-bath condominium flats of 1,133 square feet each. There are two slightly different unit layouts. Each residence has a private, detached garage with loft. Condominiums are of high quality, with five different standard finish packages and three upgraded finish packages.
The location is easily walkable to restaurants, grocery, retail, and banking. It is a 15 to 20-minute drive or express bus ride to the University of Colorado and downtown Boulder and a 5-minute drive/10-minute bike ride to an historic Old Town with numerous  restaurants, coffee, and bookshops. There is excellent bus service to Denver International Airport, downtown Denver, and local stops. Bike and walking trails run adjacent to the site, and a small lake is a two-minute walk down the trail.
Pricing for the first building was $430,000 to $477,000, depending on floor and view; the second building, now pre-selling, has increased somewhat. This pricing is reflective of home values in eastern Boulder County. There are two LGBTQ+ investor-owned units in the building opening February 2019 that will be available to those who prefer to rent, rather than buy.</description>

We seek to build a sustainable income sharing model based on providing logistical support to the wildland fire and incident response communities.  We also desire to reduce our dependence on the mainstream culture through growing &amp;amp; raising a substantial portion of our own food, implementing rotational grazing, water conservation and reducing our carbon footprint. We will strive to become better ecological stewards. Through labor sharing efforts, we intend to strengthen our bonds with other local intentional communities. 

We are focused on the big picture of working nationally to sustain our forests, watersheds, clean air and our environment for current and future generations through providing much needed logistical support services to the wildland fire and incident response communities. What better way to truly make an impact on the environment than to serve the men and woman who everyday risk their lives to protect and care for our natural resources.</description>

My expereieces have taught me that we need to honour our unique planet Earth - Gaia for she is far more than we know .  For we are unaware of her true nature and purpose which is in alignment with our evolution and purpose in being 'on earth'.
This is why I started Awakening Community in 2014 and now am opening it to new members. There is so much abundance here - mature walnut, hazel, apple,quince and plum trees all producing. I have recently planted cherry almond peach and apricot and a kiwi and grape vine.  Awakening community is blessed with abundance in the wild - cherry plums,crab apples,cornilean cherry called dryan here in Bulgaria,rosehips, hawthorn berries,. There are also many herbs growing here in the mountains various thymes mints, oregano,lemon balm,chickory,dandylion. 

My book Awakening - The Inevitable Door , to be published early next year discusses and explores the interconnection of ourselves, Gaia  and all life. and shares my experiences  , much more.. 

 My second book Awakening to Gaia reveals our ancient  ability to live a life in co operation and co creation with the spiritual essence of Gaia.  This journey of awakening to our latent dormant abilities is one of remembering and relearning .and weather we are aware or not we have a role and place to for fill in partnership with Gaia .</description>

We are a family of five humans working to build a human-scale community and living laboratory.

What is a human-scale community?
In a world in which globalization, industrialization, and large-scale thinking is the norm, our interests lie in fostering the development of hyper-local, small-scale thinking and living.
Our vision of a human-scale community is one that values, first and foremost the well-being of the humans within the community. This includes – perhaps most significantly – the well-being of the children within the community.
Well-being, as we understand it, is a multifaceted phenomenon. It consists not only of physical health, but also of a sense of belonging, a sense of purpose, and the support and nurturing of fellow humans. It means access to clean water, clean air, a pleasant and safe environment, and nourishing food. It means a safe place to learn and grow for children and adults alike.
Moreover, we do not believe that well-being can exist without consideration of the larger context in which humans exist. That is, though we believe that human-to-human interactions and communication is essential to individual well-being, that is not the whole of it. Also, it is crucial that each of us is given the opportunity to form a connection to the place where we live – the land, the wild animals, etc. We must come to know and respect the needs of the non-humans around us in order to preserve and protect the balance that supports our human needs such as clean water, clean air, healthy soil, beautiful views, and beautiful sounds.
In light of this, we believe that a human-scale community is one that prioritizes daily human-to-human communication and connection, the needs of all members of the community, and the needs of the non-human plants and animals who live in symbiosis with the humans in the community.
Although human-scale community may take many different forms, there are some underlying principals which provide some clear guidelines on what is and is not included in a human-scale community when it comes to things such as food production, the construction of buildings, and the ways in which the humans within the community interact.
Food Production
Our vision for community involves hyper-local food production. Our aspiration is to produce as close to one hundred percent of our food as possible.
This aspiration is not a rigid rule. We do not dictate that any member of the community must produce all their own food. Nor are we presently equipped to achieve that goal for ourselves within the next five years.
However, our view and experience is that having a connection with our food through its production also helps to generate many other benefits within a human-scale community. It connects us with the land and wildlife, the natural cycles, the needs of our non-human neighbors. It connects us with one another as humans because it places upon us the need to clearly communicate with one another and work cooperatively. And it helps us feel a sense of purpose since food is one of our primary needs as humans.
Within a human-scale community, food production should aspire to use as little inputs from outside the land as possible. Our vision is that, at a minimum, we wish to use no chemical inputs.

Building Construction:

Today, the norm for construction is to use manufactured lumber, adhesives, foams, and so forth, which are made in part or entirely from chemicals and in factories. Meanwhile, they are transported, often hundreds or thousands of miles – sometimes across large oceans.
Furthermore, the norm for new houses continues to be to build large dwellings.
That style of construction – while it has its advantages – is not compatible with human-scale community.
Our vision for building construction is to build houses and outbuildings by hand, using local, natural materials.
In this case, “by hand” is a loose concept open to some interpretation by the members of the community. It does not exclude using milled lumber of timbers, nails manufactured in factories, etc. But it does emphasize the value that is at play – that building within the community should be something in which our primary value of the well-being of the humans in the community is preserved. 
Therefore, rather than attempting to build with haste, our vision is to build with the long-term needs of the human and non-human needs in mind. We seek to ask questions such as “What will be the impact of this decision 50 years from now?” and “Does this decision lead to greater connection with one another and the land?”
We are particularly interested in cob as a building material. Cob is made from clay, sand, and fibrous plant material (such as straw) – all of which are generally available on one’s own land. Cob can produce strong, resilient structures that can last hundreds or thousands of years. Though cob does not have a high insulative value, it does provide thermal mass, meaning that it can help to reduce the amount of wood needed to heat a space.

Human Interactions:

We believe that daily, meaningful, substantial human-to-human interaction is necessary for our well-being. And we believe that also requires daily interaction with those outside of our nuclear families.
Our vision for community is that all members of the community are afforded many opportunities to come together daily. None of these are forced – each individual is free to choose which opportunities to take advantage of. However, we envision a community in which members are interested in taking advantage of many such opportunities.
These opportunities could include, but are not limited to meals, building projects, shared businesses, maintenance projects, firewood production, animal care, and gardening.
Additionally, we envision regular community meetings to ensure that all members stay up to date with the goings-on of others within the community as well as the community at large. Some, but not all, of these meetings will be community business meetings to discuss the business of the community.

Children:

We have three children, and children are currently central to our lives. Our vision for community is one that emphasizes the needs of the children within it.
Our belief is that children thrive when they have the right to exercise self-direction in play. We believe that a child’s work is play – that play is how children learn and grow. And we believe that children must be given the space to direct their own play.
Children – like all humans – have conflicts. We believe that it is healthy and correct to allow children the space to attempt to resolve their conflicts on their own if they wish to do so. We will intervene if we believe that safety is compromised or in the rare case in which we believe that the level of the conflict is simply beyond what the child or children can be reasonably expected to be able to resolve.
Our vision for community is that all of its children members are allowed to play freely with a level of adult supervision appropriate to the ages of the children and without excessive intervention.
We also envision a community in which children are heard – where the adults make genuine efforts to hear what the children are attempting to communicate. We believe that children are inherently social beings. However, they are not typically skilled in communicating their social needs in ways that adults easily understand. Therefore, we believe that we can foster their social development by taking the time to truly listen.

Social Sustainability:

Our vision is that the members of the community prioritize building a hyperlocal community within walking distance.
Today it is the norm for both children and adults to meet their social needs often through extensive car travel. While we believe that there are many benefits to having a wide social network, we also feel that having hyper-local social outlets readily available offers important benefits most of us are missing.
To that end, we wish to build a community in which no one must travel by car in order to meet their social needs. We envision a community in which the norm is for children members to play together daily and adult members to socialize daily – all within walking distance.

Money:

Our vision is that each adult member or family of the community maintains their own separate finances. Members buy in to the community with a one-time fee. Members also contribute on a schedule to a community fund to pay for property taxes, maintenance fees, and other community costs.

Decision Making:

Our vision is to maintain community-wide values of respect, honesty, vulnerability and clarity in our communication process, and with those values in mind, to make our community decisions through a form of consensus. A consensus-based decision-making process would foster a cohesive fluidity in the long-term growth and evolution of our community. Consensus produces a feeling of equality and collaboration, and although decisions may be more time-consuming to conclude when compared to a majority-rules voting style, the implementation of those decisions would be quicker and smoother within the community due to the wholehearted support of each member.  

Growth &amp;amp; New Members:

We envision our community growing in a way which can be sustainably supported by our communal land. At this time, we estimate that fertile land could support one family per 10 acres, not including wetland acreage. Prospective members would complete a membership process, including a trial year, before becoming full members of the community.

Living Laboratory:

Our vision is that the community will house a living laboratory that will be open to the public to share what we learn about human-scale community, sustainability and simple living skills.
The laboratory will take form as publications (newsletters, books, etc.,) workshops and retreats. Ideas for workshop and retreat topics include, but are not limited to: handmade house construction, cob oven building, keeping goats naturally in New England, beekeeping, rainwater harvesting, decision-making in community, and herbalism.</description>

We are not discriminating against other religions but we know that there are no actual sovereign nations that are for Christians unlike other nations that are based on Islamic beliefs and ideology. So we plan to have a Christian based nation where Christians from all over the world can come and be protected and not be persecuted based off of their beliefs like they are in some parts of the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/star-kingdom/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/star-kingdom/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Star Kingdom is a community that is trying to establish a new nation on the South Pacific islands known as the Kermadec Islands. The form of government is going to be a Parliamentary Monarchy with the founder Austin Rowe as the Monarch and once we get to the islands and establish our homesteads then we will vote on a Parliament. The first settlements will most likely start on the main island which is Raoul Island. Each household will be given several acres of land to build their homes, grow their crops, livestock, and anything else they want to do with their land. The Kermadec Islands are currently under the jurisdiction of New Zealand but the idea is to move to the islands and build our settlements and as long as we don't start any trouble with New Zealand then we should theoretically be okay and eventually claim independence through peaceful means. The islands are situated hundreds of miles away from New Zealand so I doubt they will even notice us there until after we establish ourselves on the island.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23046&quot;&gt;Star Tribal Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our focus is on living off of the land and practicing Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/star-tribal-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/star-tribal-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hi, I am creating a small Christian community on my piece of land where people can come and spend their weekend living off of the land. We will set up tents, have a garden that we will eat from throughout the weekend, we will have bond fires for the community to spend time together, etcetera. The idea is to eventually get a larger piece of land and build homes on it for our community members to live on a full time basis but for now we are doing more of a trial period at my current residence with tents and such just for all of the people to get to know each other and learn to live and work together for when we decide to move to a more permanent community. The more permanent community will eventually become totally self sufficient with solar panels, farms, a water well, a section of woods for hunting, livestock, and anything else we will need to live completely self sufficient. If you are interested in being apart of this community then please send me an email. Thank you.</description>

There are a variety of residential units, school and university buildings and buildings for hydropondic gardens and dairy, all constructed of fire and earthquake resistant concrete. The buildings are all of the monolithic dome design, which is both energy efficient and the strongest structure known. 

Each residential unit is constructed of concrete with embedded fine mesh metal screen wire to form a Faraday Cage. Inside there is a Satyug Sanctuary Pyramid for each person or couple, and a Goloka Projector for perfect Vastu. There are units to accommodate from one person to entire families.

Each Goloka Sanctuary Community is fully sustainable and self-sufficient - everything for a comfortable lifestyle is included in the community, including organic hydropondic gardens and an ahimsa dairy. Each community has a MahaVideha University Campus and a MahaVideha School, plus a Sri Vyuha Ashram.

Every adult has some light duties to perform for the management, maintenance, and security of the community. The children enjoy the finest education in the MahaVideha School. Every adult is encouraged to attend courses at the MahaVideha University Campus and earn their Doctor of Divinity degree during their stay. Then enjoy life in the Bliss of Krishna Consciousness in the Sri Vyuha Ashram.

Everyone in the community is enrolled in the Satyug Kaya Kalpa Program to create their Satyug Physiology for the coming Krishna Golden Age. Everyone has a Maha Yajña Vitara so the individual and the entire community is Invincible.

These Goloka Sanctuary Communities are our way of surviving the effects of the pralaya so we can thrive in the new Krishna Golden Age. Please read our book that describes this in detail: www.returningtogoloka.com.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23048&quot;&gt;Ansatz Collective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to foster a community of mutual support and respect, help one another achieve lifelong goals, and introduce our community members to our individual interests for the purpose of broadening our minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ansatz-collective/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ansatz-collective/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;**Must be in support of LGBTQ+/Kink/Alternative lifestyles**
Ansatz is a German word meaning the &quot;initial placement of a tool at a workpiece.&quot;
In relation to our community, it represents the idea that many young people have incredible dreams and goals, but sometimes we need help getting started. The purpose of this community is to unite young, intelligent, artistic, trailblazing individuals who are interested in supporting one another. We are particularly interested in creative types, charitable individuals, progressive thinkers, young liberals, those interested in sustainability and the environment, and those interested in human spirituality and sexuality. 
Our goal is to organize a small community of 5-10 wonderful friends who love each other and love working together. My plan is to purchase a multi-family townhouse in Brooklyn as a home for the community. Members must be able to pay modest rent in Brooklyn, and will be expected to contribute time towards organizing community events, participating in philanthropy/volunteering, taking care of the property, and attending group meetings. The idea is to solidify a constitution, leadership positions, and structure over the next two years until our property is purchased.</description>

      <name>Seattle Village CoHousing Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23049&quot;&gt;Seattle Village CoHousing Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; “USING THE POWER OF COMMUNITY TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE LIVING ENVIRONMENT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/seattle-village-cohousing-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/seattle-village-cohousing-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This development is in the early stages, with the goal of building approximately 25-30 homes. Our intention is to be multi-generational, net-zero, have a few micro units of affordable rentals, and supplement the food source of the community with an aquaponics growing system. 

We want to be close to public transportation and have high walkability rating. We are currently looking for a site on the outlying south end of Seattle for affordability and diversity. 

Our goal is to have shared walls in a townhouse-style development, as opposed to individual units, for affordability and maximum use of space. Our design aesthetic is modern, with minimal adornment. 

Shared resources are an important part of the Cohousing way, including shared meals, transportation, laundry, workshop, and space for arts and crafts. The multi-purpose great room and commercial kitchen in the Common House are vital spaces to our vision. This space will be flexible for use in culinary experiences, workshops, conferences, music, art, and classes. It is important for the great room to be adaptable with flow into the outdoors. 

To date, our members are Kenneth Yakle, Steve Burton, Bob Schoenecker, and Chris West. We're in the process of looking for a site, and need up to 25 more members. We've hired a professional cohousing consultant, Katie McCamant, and will be hiring an architect and developer within the next few months. 

The earlier one becomes a member, the more discount you receive on your home, and you are able to choose your preferred home in the order in which you join.

At Earth Circle we believe in creating an opportunity to live a different way on this earth, and through the creation of a sustainable community, like minded people will inevitably come together and become a vessel for change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/earth-circle/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/earth-circle/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Earth Circle endeavors to create a small community of 8-12 sustainable small and tiny homes in the Lebanon, Schuylkill, and Berks county area of Pennsylvania.  These homes will be individual and architecturally designed with flair, as well as with sustainable elements and considerations such as solar panels, composting, grey water systems, and sustsinabke building materials. We are currently looking for wooded land with water (if possible) in proximity to a college town or other thriving town or community. Organic gardening, art and music aspirations, holistic health, and yoga practice are all possibilities but there are no manditory community collaboration requirements. We are looking to get started!

      <name>Alliance for Global Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23051&quot;&gt;Alliance for Global Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Alliance for Global Community is dedicated to bringing &quot;Global Community&quot; to Humanity in a series of phases over the coming years and centuries.  What we mean by &quot;Global Community&quot; is: all of Humanity experiencing a deep Sense of Community with both Humanity and Nature all the time in all domains of life.  (By &quot;Nature&quot; we mean all species and the Earth herself.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/alliance-for-global-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/alliance-for-global-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Alliance for Global Community is a global network of small &quot;Cell Communities&quot; that will unite to form a &quot;Global Community Organism&quot;.  Several such Cell Communities are currently forming.  The Alliance is dedicated to bringing &quot;Global Community&quot; to Humanity in a series of phases over the coming years and centuries.  What we mean by &quot;Global Community&quot; is: all of Humanity experiencing a deep Sense of Community (&quot;Community&quot; with a capital &quot;C&quot; for short) with both Humanity and Nature all the time in all domains of life.  (By &quot;Nature&quot; we mean all species and the Earth herself.)  We believe that it is this deep globally-shared Sense of Community that is of the essence of who we really are, and that it is its absence in modern life (a state of &quot;Community starvation&quot;) that is the root cause of most human problems: wars, other forms of violence and abuse, racism, economic inequality, cancer and other modern diseases, addiction, etc.

Through living in many different intentional communities, we have discovered that a group living in an intentional community together does not necessarily share this deep sustained Sense of Community: it tends to come and go, and often it is not as deep as it could be.  Our research indicates that the reason for this is that various skills must be learned and practiced by all community members in order to maximize the shared Sense of Community in a group.  These skills fall into 2 main areas: relational skills and institutional design skills.  The relational skills have to do primarily with what our shared intention is and how we speak and how we listen, but exactly what these speaking and listening skills are is not obvious, and modern culture does not teach us these skills.  Similarly, we do not usually learn the various institutional design skills (for the institutions of family, residence, economy, government, education, religion, technology, etc.) necessary to design community-based institutions that will facilitate strong Community.  Such Community-facilitating institutions are essential at all levels of society if we are to attain the goal of Global Community and relieve all of the unnecessary global suffering caused by the current global Community starvation.

In order to help people learn the relational skills and institutional design skills necessary to form the network of small Cell Communities that will move us toward the goal of Global Community, we offer weekend Global Community Workshops that teach those skills and help participants to get started on forming Cell Communities (including transforming existing communities into Cell Communities) post-workshop.  In these workshops, we focus on how to facilitate deep Community with both people and Nature, and illustrate how Community with the one feeds Community with the other.  These workshops are non-profit and are offered in &quot;by donation&quot; mode, in order to cover the basic costs. 

Our workshops also help participants to learn how to connect with and be inspired by what we call the &quot;Spirit of Community&quot;, which permeates and embraces our Universe through and through.  Different individuals and groups have given different names to this Spirit of Community.  The important thing is not the name, but rather the shared experience of the reality of this inspiring Spirit.  Our workshops facilitate experiencing that reality.

Our workshop facilitators have had more than 25 years of experience in facilitating such workshops.  For detailed information on the time and place of public workshops, or to organize a workshop for your existing community or group, contact us at globalcommunity@mail.com.  We also publish a series of books called &quot;Nourishing the Sense of Community, a Collection of Stories&quot;.  These are stories told by individuals or groups of experiences of a strong Sense of Community.  We offer electronic or print copies of these books by donation, through the above email address.  If you are interested in copies of the latest volume of these stories, and/or if you would like to submit an individual or group story for the next volume, please contact us.</description>

      <name>Portland Gift Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23052&quot;&gt;Portland Gift Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; A non-residential, committed and bonded community dedicated to sharing our gifts and lives with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/portland-gift-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/portland-gift-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We’re a local, non-residential, committed and bonded community of men and women centered in inner NE and SE Portland, Oregon dedicated to sharing our gifts and lives with each other. Local means we live in Portland. Non-residential means we live in our own residences rather than owning property collectively (though some of us may do so eventually). Committed means we choose each other and make clear agreements to stay together. Bonded means that after our families, our focus is each other. 

Our community strives to maintain both diversity (particularly in age, sex, income and several other parameters) and unity via shared commitment to our intentions, values and goals.

Three intentions guide us:

(1) We seek to belong to something larger than our individual selves and nuclear families, like the tribal units that most human beings belonged to until the advent of civilization, and particularly the industrial revolution.

(2) We wish to share our lives and gifts (skills, time, resources) with each other (that’s what we mean by “gift community“).

(3) We desire to help each other live more resiliently and sustainably, and to inspire others to do the same.

The foundation of our community rests on the following premises and principles:

Throughout history, the basic human unit has been the tribe. We’ve lost touch with our tribal nature. It’s time to reconnect with it by intentionally choosing our own community-tribe in the place where we are now.

Our financial/monetary system is isolating and alienating, and seems bent on destroying itself and everything around it. It compels us to conceive of ourselves as primarily economic beings. We want to support each other in living more resiliently by stepping outside of mainstream financial/monetary frameworks when possible.

The immense stresses upon our political, economic and environmental systems oblige us to re-learn how to cooperate and share our gifts with each other. We’ll be well-served by establishing a mutual safety net.

Deep and lasting friendships are more satisfying than casual, superficial acquaintances.

As women and men we wish to feel safe with each other, practicing transparency and observing clear boundaries.

Staying in place is essential for lasting, authentic community. In the coming era of energy descent, there’s nothing more important than building local community.

Healthy and nourishing local community requires breadth, length and depth. We are committed to sharing many activities and facets of our lives (breadth), over a span of years (length), authentically and intimately (depth).

Our basic focus, after our families, is with each other.

Spirit – however each of us names or conceives of it – connects us.

We wish to inspire and lead others by our example.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23053&quot;&gt;Still Learning House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We encourage continuous learning for collective liberation, supporting each other against oppression both internal &amp;amp; external, both individual &amp;amp; systemic. We focus on intersectional social and environmental justice of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/still-learning-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/still-learning-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Community-focused residents &amp;amp; friends working together in mutual aid. The house (which we're always working to improve in wheelchair-accessibility &amp;amp; environmental friendliness) is located on road with a bus route, bike lanes, and accessible sidewalks; less than 2 miles from downtown and less than half a mile from a variety of parks &amp;amp; wooded areas (both dirt-path &amp;amp; paved).
We are in the continuous process of finding ways to better include residents/friends/visitors of marginalized identities. These involves many efforts including promoting use &amp;amp; learning of American Sign Language; using only nontoxic products; and cultivating a culture around consent, accountability, cultural sensitivity, and open communication.
There is currently a cat in residence, and plans for foster children in coming years.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23054&quot;&gt;Merkaba Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We don't enforce many 'rules' here, but we do assume a certain level of consciousness and we live by a few core principles which allow us to thrive as a community. Whether visiting, living or working within the community, you agree to adhere to these practises whilst here... 

&amp;gt; Concept of Abundance – if every person in the community gave more than they took, we would all have an abundance of everything we ever need...  

&amp;gt; Mindfulness – we are mindful in all activities throughout our day, whether this be practising yoga, eating, interacting with another person or carrying out our daily chores... this includes awareness of and accountability for our own thoughts, words and actions... 

&amp;gt; Respect for Mother Nature – we keep various animals on the land (3 dogs, 4 cats, 12 chickens, 1 cockerel, 6 ducks &amp;amp; geese) and display unconditional love, compassion and respect for all sentient beings...

&amp;gt; Oneness – we operate as one big family, always endeavouring to help and support each other, finding ways to compromise, engaging in open, conscious communication and resolving any disagreements peacefully... 

&amp;gt; Spiritual Practise – we believe that the foundation of a community is built on individual and group spiritual practise and we endeavour to raise our vibration each day, in whatever way, shape or form that may take... 

&amp;gt; Waste Management – we are mindful of all forms of waste in our endeavour to be fully sustainable. We either recycle or find ways to upcycle in other areas of the community. With this in mind, please try to bring as little plastic to the community as possible. This also applies to food (cooking and eating) where we try to operate a zero waste policy. 

General Information  
We eat a predominantly vegan diet, with the exception of the eggs from our chickens which are fed an organic, non-GMO diet. We grow some fruit and vegetables, but whilst we are developing our land to increase farming capacity, we also buy fresh, seasonal produce from a local organic farmer. We also purchase nuts, seeds, grains and superfood supplements from an organic wholesaler. 

We are fully solar-powered, collect rain water and pump water from a borehole in the ground. Therefore we have to limit our power and water usage accordingly. We do have a washing machine but this is for bedding and towels only so please do not use for personal laundry. 

There is a high risk of fire in this and surrounding areas due to the hot, dry environment. We do permit smoking but please respect allocated smoking areas and make note of fire safety procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/merkaba-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/merkaba-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are an off-grid eco-community nestled in the Portuguese Gardunhia mountain range near Fundão, set in beautiful, wild nature. Our community is a haven for spiritual seekers, health enthusiasts, artists, adventurers, and anyone who wants to explore the healthy way of living needed for a new paradigm. Every day is different at Merkaba. We are always growing, always having fun, and our focus is always on sustainability, great health and spiritual development. We live on fresh, nutritious food, either grown ourselves or sourced locally, along with fresh well water as we continue to expand this space.
Our community consists of two Geodesic domes, a double decker bus converted into a fully functional house, an outdoor gym, an infinity yoga deck and during 2018 we plan to add a pool, sauna and our very first eco home built almost entirely out of waste. For those seeking to go within there are lots of spaces around the site to chill out and meditate and for those seeking an external adventure we have a plethora of local activities to suit everyone.

We’re doing all we can to live in harmony with Mother Nature and each other, and paving the path for a sustainable future. At Merkaba we aim to provide an open, supportive space for authentic self-expression and expansion and have a positive social &amp;amp; ecological impact on the world through empowering people to live in a more sustainable way.</description>

	Our community wishes to conserve natural resources for present and future generations while striving to continually improve ecological awareness and practice. We furthermore wish to create processes for group communication and participation and provide an environment which supports people's development.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23057&quot;&gt;Points Beyond Cottages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our values include; sustainability, diversity, multi-generational members, eco-friendliness, peace and social justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/points-beyond-cottages/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/points-beyond-cottages/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;In 2013 a group of households came together for a potluck in Silverton, Oregon. Our purpose was to enjoy the great feast that we produced from our individual homes and to also talk about an idea that had surfaced for several of us; intentional community. That was the beginning of Points Beyond. Since that time we have incorporated as an LLC, located and purchased a beautiful piece of land, and obtained preliminary approval from the City of Silverton for our project (including the necessary rezoning).
One of our associate members suggested the name “Points Beyond” which likely needs an explanation. Think of when you are traveling by train or bus and the next station is announced. Sometimes the message is the name of a location with the trailer, “…and points beyond”. There is always that other, further, often intriguing place to come and a sense of disappointment if you have to disembark before getting there. For those of us who are joining together to make this new home, it will be our “points beyond”; a place that is new and exciting where we have not been before and where we can explore a different way to adventure together.
Points Beyond will be an intentional community of private homes clustered around shared space. Each single family home has traditional amenities, including a private kitchen and small yard area. Our shared spaces will feature a common house, which includes a large kitchen and dining area, laundry, and recreational spaces. We will also have a workshop with added guest quarters, and carports/garages with personal storage at both ends of the property. Shared outdoor space includes parking, walkways, open space, and gardens. Community members also share resources like tools, books, and recreational equipment. Households have independent incomes and private lives, but neighbors collaboratively plan and manage community activities and shared spaces.</description>

This is a non-traditional opportunity so we have a non-traditional recruitment process.We are not looking for people to fill defined roles at Malamaki. We are looking for people who are answering their own calling (life purpose) and need a context in which to do so. If that is you, please respond to the following questions. Take great care with your response. If we take you on, your response to these questions will be the cornerstone of your contract with us. If you tell us what you think we want to hear, you are setting yourself up for certain failure. Also, you haven’t a clue as to what we “want to hear”.

1. What do you intend to do with the rest of your life?

2. WHY?     (That’s the key question)

3. Please describe the (functional) steps you perceive as fundamental to achieving your intentions.

Simply tell the truth and tell the truth simply. We are not looking for eloquence, just clarity of purpose. If we are in a position to facilitate your objectives, we will respond. If you are not yet absolutely clear what you are up to, please save us all a lot of time and heartache. This opportunity would not work out for you.

P.S. We would also love to peruse your resume.</description>

      <name>The Nettle Bed</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23060&quot;&gt;The Nettle Bed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Queers learn to farm in community!&quot; We're queer and trans folks + allies who care about justice and relationships, learning urban gardening and homesteading, connected to a rural queer land project and farm in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-nettle-bed/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-nettle-bed/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The idea for a queer- and trans- centered urban homestead began when the two queer farmers of Racing Heart Farm reached out to build more community around their duplex in the city. When they finally &quot;bought the farm&quot; in 2017 and moved out to the country to begin their queer land project, Heartland, three people moved into the top floor of the city house to form The Nettle Bed. Named for the medicinal wild plant being cultivated in our backyard, we hope this space will be one of nourishment, safety, resistance, and roots.    

Our home is located on a bustling corner of the Phillips / Ventura Village neighborhood, a primarily working-class and POC neighborhood, and the historic birthplace of the American Indian Movement. The neighborhood is home to an active Islamic Center, American Indian Center, Waite House Community Center, indigenous art gallery, library, and several community gardens. We're also just blocks down the street from the Wildflower Worker and Rye House / Minneapolis Catholic Worker communities.

Daily Life and Dreams: We engage in community with our downstairs neighbors via weekly dinners and collaboration on some gardening and yard projects. The Nettle Bed has a large, fenced-in extra-large lot with raised garden beds, grass mowed by grazing rabbits, young apple and chokecherry trees, berry bushes, medicinal plants, rain barrels, and fire pit. None of us are experts at growing things, but we are learning as we go and hope to continue to incorporate permaculture design as we develop the yard. (Mushrooms? Chickens?) We enjoy gathering people for events that range from tender and reflective to joyfully rowdy, so far including: backyard concerts, Solstice bonfires, song circles, game nights, and weekly meals. Our downstairs neighbors have also hosted documentary nights and speakers about local organizing efforts. We seek to question mainstream American culture by living simply; talk about race, class, and gentrification; support each other in learning and unlearning; establish seasonal and yearly traditions; do things outside the house together (attend performances and actions, participate in neighborhood events, go camping, visit the farm); and build an extended community of warm, close relationships. 

Opportunities out at the farm include: Helping on vegetable operation- big harvests, weeding, transplanting, processing (drying, fermenting, canning, freezing, cidering), Building projects (deck, dance floor, earthen oven, composting toilet, sauna, outdoor kitchen, cabin), Hosting workshops / skill shares, Creating an artist retreat/residency, Learning about chickens and sheep, Wild crafting/foraging, or starting a small business that requires a little land in the country (eg beekeeping).</description>

      <name>La Smala</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23062&quot;&gt;La Smala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The purpose of la Smala is to facilitate the development of projects aimed at reducing the ecological footprint. For this purpose, it undertakes initiatives offering alternatives to overconsumption and overproduction.
In particular, it organizes the management of &quot;vacant&quot; houses, on a provisional basis, within the framework of contracts known as &quot;loans for use&quot;, and periodic meetings of reflection on the topic of degrowth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/la-smala/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/la-smala/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Since 1993, Smala institute develops experience/expertise in socio-environmental entrepreneurship and eco-community building, a kind of living lab. It provides training, coaching and hosting for over 1’800 beneficiaries from 1993 to 2017, out of which ¼ are social entrepreneurs, and 3/4 are artists, families, students, seniors and unemployed.

Smala has managed over 40 co-housing spaces with intergenerational and creative “hives”. We started in the industrial district of Lausanne “le Flon”, contributing in revitalizing it as a new source of creativity, a little Soho. Thanks to the socio-economic success encountered with this first initiative, Smala received from the public and private partners new opportunities to develop similar “living laboratories” in other locations.

Ever since 1995, Smala team has tackled the challenge of incubating 40 short and mid-term hives, eco-life learning centres, with 5 to 30 cohabitants and co-workers in each location, in the Lausanne area. These temporary hives had a duration of 1 to 10 years, and have been developed in partnership and/or supported by local and federal administrations for housing, social services, culture, academic research, adult training, NGOs and sociocultural centres.

These activities have made Smala institute resilient to societal changes and demonstrated its ability to manage complex governance situations.

Since 2013, Smala moved to a new step in starting the development of long-term communities, on rural lands with cooperative ownership. While searching for international references to compare Smala’s innovative methods with other initiatives, Smala experts have identified the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN) as one of the most efficient knowledge alliances for social entrepreneurship learning; Smala is now a member of GEN-Europe.

Smala experts have included a special focus and expertise on transversal/soft skills building and fair trade culture within community building, both aspects being considered as key complements to vocational skills for active citizenship and right livelihood.

Smala’s leading team is composed of pioneers of change who contributed significantly in the transition of this industrial district and/or other socially innovative places and enterprises.

By moving so many times our headquarters and healing various new places, Our team has developed a replicable art of co-living and co-working, using informal “learning while doing” methods. It became a fair set of rules of functioning (governance) that we updated at each new community project, becoming the Ecopol label after 20 years of experience. 

2014-2018: Smala builds ecovillages!

After incubating the Bâtir Groupé cooperative from 2006 to 2013, we bought a land in Cheiry and then in Grandvaux. We built both houses and human relationships. Smala officially becomes a member of GEN-Europe, the ecovillage network (2013). Then, the successes followed. We inaugurated Cheiry on the 21st of August 2016, and then the ecovillage « Berber » in Grandvaux the 25th of Novembre 2017. Smala is a small federation of communities which born in Romandie. We favour social ecology on the basis of the Ecopol social contract, beyond the pre-requisites already well established in the Swiss culture, such as energy-efficiency, affordable rents in co-operative and infrastructure sharing (laundry, vegetable gardens, party room, carpool, etc.).

We organized more than 150 conferences and sharing evenings on the art of living together between 2013 and 2018. Our Ecopol service is now consulted by dozens of eco-project holders, each with their own sensibilities, and we have studied dozens of projects to help others develop their vision of eco-housing.

We are celebrating our 25th anniversary on September 8, 2018, in our new Transition Training Center, Berber House, in the heart of the magnificent Lavaux UNESCO Heritage.</description>

We are seeking other awakened beings of light, who possess a trade-able skill or two (Such as Massage, Reiki, Yoga, Tai Chi, Chi Gong, Meditation, Mindfulness, Aikido, Permaculture Design, Herbalism, or any other like-minded practice), LGBTQ friendly (allies welcome), and 420 friendly humans and their fur babies, who are looking for their place in the world to sustain a livelihood and home in one place. We believe by connecting like-minded collaborative humans to create this Intentional Community, we can keep the costs down to $700 per person (or less).

We are looking to create a collaborative living situation that feeds us individually and collectively, for our body-minds &amp;amp; spirits, through shared community responsibilities to maintain our group home in love and light. Many of us have been called to create something like this. If this community speaks to your heart, and you are ready to try something new, please contact us today.

If you have lived in an Intentional Community previously, we are interested in interviewing you to help us with this new Intentional Community Development. Please send me a message or post here and we'll reach out to you.

If you own a large piece of property in the Ojai, Moorpark, Simi Valley, Chatsworth, Granada Hills, Westlake Village or Thousand Oaks area, and you have been called by spirit to share it in some way with your community, you will know when you meet us if this is the right choice. Please contact us with more info about your space.

The original partners and perspective partners are no longer interested in the project, so I am searching for new members. The community will own 83 acres of mostly arable land that will be rented to members and non-members with priority given to members. Originally we decided to build a new house with a shared space and private living modules. Construction has not begun yet, so any new members would have influence on the design and operation of the living arrangement. I hope to eventually convert the current house into a restaurant and/or bakery that primarily uses product grown on site. The owner of the property will pay for the construction of the new house, and members will buy into the community. Financing may be available for anyone who can't afford the initial investment.</description>

Earth Heart owns the freehold of the Grade II listed converted farmhouse and barns. The east wing of the barns is partially converted to create a communal hall for meetings and gatherings, as well as workshop space and storage. We are as ecological as we can manage/afford, having a communal woodpellet boiler for heating, a reed bed waste-water treatment system and using a green electricity company.
The surrounding 21 acres of organic land is managed primarily for nature conservation. There is a large parkland running down to Henmore Brook with a moat (an English Heritage scheduled ancient monument) and other small pastures (grazed with a local organic farmer’s sheep and cows). There is a secluded woodland with a tree circle, a community orchard and allotments with vegetables, fruit and herbs. There is a willow labyrinth and dome, a composting toilet and solar shower dome.
Members of the community own 900+ year leases on the 8 individual homes and each home has private use of a small garden. We set up in 1997 around principles of natural parenting and home-education. We aim for a diverse group of people of a variety of ages, including singles, couples and families with children, with home-owning members as well as tenants and non-member lodgers. Most people are employed off site but some are based from home. We have the advantage of being able to enjoy our independent lives with privacy when we want it, whilst also living within a mutually supportive and sociable community.
We have community work days and business meetings once a month and occasional ‘sharing’ meetings. Important decisions are taken by consensus and general management is carried out by land, maintenance, finance and administration teams. We have a minimum co-op work requirement for every resident with an expectation of everyone doing a fair share and we understand that nothing gets done unless we all contribute. We expect people to participate regularly in co-op meetings but they are not compulsory.
We are not open to the public but offer guided walks and workshops for groups of 6 people or more. We also host and run various camps during the spring and summer and are happy to consider hosting new groups for camps.
Opportunities arise from time to time to buy, rent or lodge here. If you are interested in visiting with a view to going on our waiting list, do email us for further details.
There is currently three properties for sale, a 3 bedroom house £299,950, and a 4 bedroom house £350,000. For more information please email earth.heart@hotmail.co.uk or search www.rightmove.co.uk using our postcode DE61NS.</description>

We see true health as holistic-balancing the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of ourselves as well as our surroundings and environment.

To fulfill our mission, we offer a variety of holistic and educational programs, classes and retreats aimed at raising awareness of the benefits of conscious living.  We strive to partner with other organizations that are on the front lines of helping people navigate chronic illness or other difficult life circumstances.  

We are committed to bringing restoration and hope to our community and to the earth-always striving to encourage a model of sustainable living and health by example, education and living in harmony with nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/jade-haven-permaculture-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/jade-haven-permaculture-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Jade Haven Permaculture Village has a unique vision that will enable both a comfortable way of life for its members, as well as a place of learning and creating for its guests.

We will offer a lovely retreat with all of the spa amenities for guests to enjoy while they take advantage of dynamic workshops and seminars  better health and fuller living in mind.  (Special courses will be offered  on a regular basis, for those who suffer from chronic illness, designed to assist in the re-balancing of health.)   There will also be a section of housing set aside for those who have suffered severe setbacks in their lives, and who would benefit from a temporary living arrangement in which they might learn a trade to help them along.

Our community will be accepting of anyone who shares our vision.  We will not discriminate against physical ability or lifestyle preferences.  We believe that the contribution of community members should be something they are not just capable of doing, but something that they truly love doing.  

At this time, our community consists of a handful of fun-loving, empathetic, and accepting individuals of all ages and various different spiritual backgrounds.  Feel free to contact us to inquire about attending a meeting or group activity.</description>

Homes will be built and land will be used in an environmentally sensitive and socially responsible manner.


To provide permanently affordable access to land for such purposes as quality housing, sustainable agriculture, cottage industries and co-operatives by forever removing the land from the speculative market.


To develop and exercise responsible and ecological practices, which preserve, protect and enhance the land’s natural attributes.


To serve as a model in land stewardship and community development by providing information, resources and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/mil-abrazos-community-land-trust/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/mil-abrazos-community-land-trust/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITY

The Mil Abrazos Community Land Trust in New Mexico is looking for Interns

Our nonprofit organization just purchased 32 acres (20 irrigated) of farmland in Dilia, along the Pecos River, 30 min south of Las Vegas and 1.5 hr from Santa Fe.

Our mission is to acquire and hold land in trust in order to provide for permanently affordable housing, as well as affordable access to land for such purposes as sustainable agriculture, cottage industries and co-operatives by forever removing the land from the speculative market.

The goal of our project is to create an agrarian community and educational center that seeks to demonstrate and disperse evolving permaculture principles near and wide, and teach technologies and strategies appropriate for the biome we live in.

Interns must be interested in being at the foundation of what could be a fascinating project. Must be able to do research, writing, construction, presentations and gardening to feed themselves.

We are in a start-up phase, currently building accommodations for interns and visitors, repairing the flood (acequia) irrigation system and cleaning up the property.

In the Spring, we will begin a facilitated process aimed at creating a Master Plan, drawing on the many local talents in Permaculture, holistic land management, watershed restoration, as well as organizations dealing with food justice, veterans, summer camps, hospice care and more.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23073&quot;&gt;The Coastal Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The vision for our community is to work, play, celebrate, share meals, make decisions and enjoy activities together.
We believe in celebrating our children and honouring our elders while supporting healthy human development through all stages of life.
The culture of our pedestrian-oriented, coastal village is characterized by inclusiveness and diversity, respect for privacy, generosity of spirit, love of nature and appreciation for aesthetics.
In the spirit of mutual support, our community is a place where the most reliable wealth is found in relationships, both within the community and with our neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-coastal-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-coastal-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are looking for land that has a good view of the water, along the BC coast in a natural setting which is relatively accessible to an urban area or town.  We aim to create an inter-generational, sustainable (in all senses of the word), economical community in a village-like setting.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23074&quot;&gt;La rêverie du Loupier / the dreamfactory of the Loupier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; La rêverie du Loupier (the DreamFactory of the Loupier) is a place where we understand that knowing oneself is the key for a peaceful way of life. We respect others and their ways of life even if we disagree with them or don't understand them (for example I'm almost vegan but I have a good friend who is a hunter). We know that we don't know THE truth, we just do our best to be truthfull. Integrity, courage and kindness are key words. We don't reject society, we just try to offer another option that tries it's best to be a bit more harmonious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/la-reverie-du-loupier-the-dreamfactory-of-the-loupier/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/la-reverie-du-loupier-the-dreamfactory-of-the-loupier/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This project is born from a serie of intuitions that started to make sense with the years passing. I've built back an ancient farm next to Paris (1h15), in the beginning of Burgundy. For the moment the community is 2 cats and me (Manou). I've decided to gather a bunch of good people with the same approach to life that I have in order to create a place where it's nice to live, and where people can come to have a rest from society and eventually to heal themselves.

So, for the moment I'm at the stage of meeting with people who would be interested in developping such a place. The criteria is pretty simple : 
- people who have done an important work about themselves, through therapy, meditation, chamanism, etc. The place will be small, maximum 3 families, so it's important that the people who will be the core of this community have a strong and clear knowledge of themselves. It's doesn't mean that we should all be Buddhas, as I'm clearly not one, but that we should have a clear understanding of how we function and how our own ways can interfere with a group. 

The plan for the moment is to put 3 yurts in the field and use the house and the buildings as common parts. Also, we will be able to host events like yoga retreats in the house in order to create an economical base for the community. 

The house has a strong economical value, but I'm open to creative solutions. 

I've realized that it could be a strong quality to have a multicultural group, that's why I'm connecting here. 

We'll have to invent everything, so it's quite an adventure to start. 

The house needs some little fixing before being 100% ok to host groups. Also I would love to create a dancing hall as I love contact impro dancing, but that's for the future !!!</description>

is the best way to survive physically and spiritualy the doomsdays ahead and it is the best way to live now.
The last thing you want is to be surrounded by peoples who loose their good values in bad time. 

To prepare a safe heaven for doomsday together and be happy in the process and live a good life with all the ingredients for happiness.

Our technological society have been at the crossroads for a while but at any moment, a global disaster or war to maintain/restore the global order could happen and the supply routes of food might be shut and the chaos in the city will be monstrous. Hopefully the world will cross that cross road peacefully but we are not yet in a safe zone as many dangers are growing and looming. Our goal is to be as far as possible so we can remain unaffected and grow our food or directly harvest it from nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/aeon-doomsdays-heaven/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/aeon-doomsdays-heaven/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Arc Heaven Doomsdays
is a good and fun way to survive in confort the doomsdays maybe ahead while staying positive and confident in our future.
Screening ensure that only humble and respectful peoples with some basic good morals qualities can join.

You can use this e9ma9il also to contact directly but you have to remove the numbers:      
d9o9o9m9s9d9a9y9s9@9t9u9t9a9n9o9t9a9.9c9o9m
However you better sign up for an e9m9a9i9l first at as your e9m9a9il is maybe crappy.
t9u9t9a9n9o9t9a.9c9o9m

Arc Heaven Doomsdays
is not only a safe refuge but a very happy place composed of  peoples who have some awareness of how wicked and fragile our civilization is and the catastrophic risks that lies ahead. A good character with good morals is a minimum to join Arc Doomsdays Heaven and this means that you are not required to believe anything to join Arc Doomsdays Heaven but you are required to follow the leadership which main goal is to make decisions in the best interests of community and the best interests is what makes peoples more happy and how our community can be more prosperous.

Arc Heaven Doomsdays
It is also a good place for those who have a spiritual aspiration to become better a little bit in the way that Christians believe that they have to be good to go to heaven or the eastern faith about avoiding bad karma but our faith is more a loose collection of beliefs based on a variety of traditions (New Age , Yoga , Buddhism , etc.) and scientific discoveries. In anyways you will have plenty of time for silence, prayers and meditation if this is something you enjoy.

Arc Heaven Doomsdays
is about preparing to survive a disaster but at the same time peoples are encourage to enjoy their daily lives and have the peace of mind to know that together we are prepared for most eventualities. 

At Arc Heaven Doomsdays
We are like a family and we take care of all the needs of the peoples in the community. Volontary work within our organization is encouraged (but not not mandatory) and we try to make it fun and rewarding with the various business we own. Some work require contact with the rest of the civilization and therefore we have city bases too for those of us who want to work in the city but around here we are never far of the mountain and the ocean so there is no problem to spend time in the cities.

 We do a lot of activities together such as camping , parties , hiking , electric bicycling,  quad-ding , boating etc.  
Of course one fun activity is to prepare together for Doomsday.

 Like a regular ecovillage we strive to be off grid and use solar power and other devices to bring all the comforts of modern life but we like also our equipment and gears to be portable and lightweight and to have appropriate doomsdays vehicles to move in the case that we need to move.

Part of the money we make is used to buy more equipment for our community.

We have an almost endless free supply of recreational substance such as alcohol (wine and beer making) and (weed cheap and legal) but use of it is not encouraged but it can be available in small and occasional occasions.

There is also ways for an individual to make alot of easy money but you should not join if your main motivation is to make money because money in the hands of the members might be found to be a source of corruption and money might be eliminated at the discretion of the administration who will then keep all the money and use it to share the resources among the members however making money is still possible now.

We stated that we grow 25% of our food however this number could be 100% very easily harvested but it is convenient to buy bulk food for now and we try to have 100% organic food.

We strive to be happy , eat organic food , being close to nature , far from pollution , independent , off grid.
We currently have access to many private lands and we do regular trips to the city for work and or leisure.

At the moment we have a few habitations ready . 

There is no fee to join but more comfort could be purchased.

We have a policy about accepting and equal amount of single man and single women to create a balance and so you could be put on a waiting list until we can accept more peoples but if you have savings that you would like to share or invest then you will be able to bypass the waiting list of course but remember that there is no fee to join. 

Unfortunately the description here is only a pale description of how great Arc doomsdays heaven is but you can trust Arc doomsdays heaven to be greater but some of information must stay occulted for now like our ufo projects :) . After sufficient peoples have joined, we can then make public more plans. At the moment , we are still in the most exciting early stages and ready to take off as soon as a few peoples have joined.</description>

To serve Humanity by creative group meditation, offering guiding spiritual principles to help individuals lead more soul centered lives. Group participation is an active process, which will be balanced with individual integration, and may include personal retreat space.

We offer this center to become a potential outpost for the externalizing Hierarchical Ashrams. Contemporary teachings, which inspire and prepare for the great opportunities of the 21st century will be researched and taught.

 

The Center’s Values and Guiding Principles

The WRC seeks to promote a newer form of spiritual living embodiment to assist in incarnating the human soul.

We shall offer our facilities to visiting speakers and celebrate these new teachings of Conscious Soul embodiment.

In time as we develop such a community and its attending school, we hope to link with those other schools worldwide who also offer the new teachings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-wisdom-retreat-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-wisdom-retreat-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Wisdom Retreat Center is a group attempt for the physical expression of the newer schools for training in psycho-spiritual evolution.

We launch our Wisdom center with the hope to anchor new seeds of archetypal fire and assist in engineering a new renaissance of authentic spiritual living.

Its curriculum will be highly synthetic, drawing on the Wisdom Teachings of many teachers including Alice Bailey, Lucille Cedercrans, Helena Roerich and various others.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23087&quot;&gt;White Lake Intentional Christian Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We aim to live sustainably (consuming less, sharing items, growing food, living small) together (sharing a property with family units) while honoring Christ (involving community spiritual rhythms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/white-lake-intentional-christian-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/white-lake-intentional-christian-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Inspired by the community living and sustainable practices from our internship and work at A Rocha Canada, a Christian conservation organization, we purchased roughly three acres on land in White Lake, BC, Canada.  This land is 25 minutes away from Salmon Arm affording easy access to amenities, but is unzoned so we are legally capable of building as many dwellings as needed for our community.  What started as raw land in 2017 now has (almost!) three dwelling units in housed in two dwellings. We are currently living in the cabin on site as a family of four and hope that roughly in May 2018 either two family units (a couple, a family, friends living together as family, etc.) or one family unit and some interns will join us.  We are in the process of looking for people to join us who ideally will want to form long-term community with us.  We are very open to people being creative about how to form community on the property.  We have built a showerhouse with a shower, toilet, laundry and fridge/freezer for those who may live onsite in tiny houses without those amenities or for people who may want to come and camp to participate in what's going on here!</description>

Common people should have access to all resources, get enough opportunities and be part of decision making processes impacting their lives. People around the world need to be supported in their struggle for liberation from oppression and exploitation. The rich, vibrant diversity of nature and culture needs to be preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/makkal-mandram-peoples-forum/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/makkal-mandram-peoples-forum/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our Commune comprises core members of our people's organization called Makkal Mandram (meaning People's Forum) which works among the most marginalized Tribal (indigenous)  and Dalit (caste oppressed) communities in the northern part of Tamil Nadu. Our main work is socio-political in nature. The core principles of our commune life includes social justice, equity, shared living (sharing household chores, raising children, social and political work), trust and cooperation.  We don't own private property. Our children go to government schools. We go to government hospitals for our healthcare needs. We believe that manual labour and brain work should be treated equally. We do physical labour in our farms and construction activities whenever need arises.</description>

      <name>Morganton Fellowship</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23090&quot;&gt;Morganton Fellowship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Jeremiah 6:16 - &quot;Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/morganton-fellowship/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/morganton-fellowship/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our names are Ryan and Siobhan Gagliardo.  We are a Christian husband and wife with five young children in search of spiritual fellowship in Morganton, NC.  If we had to define ourselves in denominational terms (which we are not fond of doing!) it would have to be Mennocostal Quaker, which breaks down to:  “Menno” for Mennonite (Menno Simons and the Anabaptists), “Costal” for Pentecostal (Book of Acts), and Quaker (John Woolman).  My wife and girls wear Mennonite dresses and my wife wears a headcovering.  We both became Christians in our teenage years while attending an Assemblies of God church.  We searched the Bible over the years and prayed to God for answers to life's greatest questions.  It has been very hard for us to fit into most churches and to accept the many unbiblical and unnatural lifestyles and traditions that often prevail.  

We share family Bible readings, prayer, and singing together most evenings and Sunday mornings.  We strive to raise our children to be quieter and well behaved, which has been an excruciating challenge, but well worth it thanks to God’s help.   

In application of our faith, we are growing more and more interested in how to live in greater harmony with the natural world that God has given us.  In the past we have raised chickens, ducks, and turkeys for meat and eggs.  We just recently got back into keeping twenty chickens under a tractor coop that we move around the property.  We have experience with keeping a few dairy goats and have learned a lot about the value of rotational pasture grazing for meat and milk.  I (Ryan) have nearly finished a complete reading of Dr. Westin A. Price’s, Nutrition and Physical Degeneration.  It has been a truly epic and life changing read for me that has resonated so deeply with the many reflections I have had about modern life over the years.   

My wife and I purchased a half acre of land in February 2017 with a small mobile home on it.  It is mostly cleared land with plenty of space for gardening.  Last year I took classes in the Asheville area about wild foods and medicine, which has touched upon many aspects of permaculture and sustainable living.  We are heading toward foraging more for our food, which often includes fresh road killed deer and a variety of wild nuts and greens.  There is also a lot of potential for fishing in local streams and lakes.  With help, we could grow a lot more food on our property as well as on a field just walking distance down the road which we have permission to use.  There is also a five acre bottomland plot just behind and adjoining our property which may soon become available to purchase.  

There is a house for sale with several acres just catty corner to our place with a large separate workshop/garage and partly finished upstairs living space.  There should also be a one acre homestead for sale just two houses down from us with a three bedroom house, fruit trees, and an already cleared field where there had been a garden in the past.            

We don’t currently have much additional room in our two bedroom house other than a futon in the school room.  Otherwise, we could park a small camper just next to the house and run a 120V power cord out to it.  We could offer backyard tent/yurt/or other? space surrounded by woods.  It is a quiet neighborhood on a side road which does not get much traffic.  We have neighbors, but enough woods in between that we can hardly see any of them from the backyard.        

We are currently off-grid for water and heat.  We draw water by hand from a shallow well just behind the house.  We haven’t perfected doing laundry by hand, but just recently found a hand wringer that we are about to use.  We are on the verge of transitioning into composting our human waste.  We also have a woodstove that we use for heat and a good amount of cooking.  Our goal is to also do more outdoor wood cooking in dutch ovens as well as a Green Egg grill/smoker.    

We are located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains just 15 min. north of South Mountain State Park in Morganton, NC.  The famous city of Asheville is under an hour away, which we visit often enough.  We love the outdoors and enjoy hiking, canoeing, camping, fishing, and foraging for wild foods.  My wild food class introduced me to several new friends in and around Asheville.   

We crave genuine loving fellowship with other believers or seekers of truth that are open to dialogue about life and faith.  A mutual commitment to life growth will be essential and openness to receive the input of others into the deepest and often most personal and touchy areas of our lives.  We try to be as Spirit-led and sensitive as possible, but real communal life will show us our truest selves very quickly. Our commitment is to utilize that experience to grow and allow God to refine and mature us in every way necessary.      

I have dropped my normal factory (glassblowing) work hours to allow me to take care of home projects and eventually discover a more earth and family-oriented source of income.  I have a few ideas that I am prayerfully exploring.     

Je parle aussi assez bien francais et donc les francophones sont les bienvenus!  J'ai voyage dans plusiers regions de la France et aussi un peu en Cote d'Ivoire.  Ce sont des pays et une langue qui me manque beaucoup.  

Hablo tambien bastante espanol.  Yo vivi algunos meses en Costa Rica y viaje a Nicaragua, Cuba, Guatemala, y Puerto Rico.            

May the Lord richly bless and lead you as you consider sharing fellowship with us!</description>

We are committed to the ideas of shared labor and resources, inclusion, open-mindedness, non-judgment,  acceptance, personal freedom, support, and simple living.

We aspire for a small homestead inspired community built on principles of sustainability. We will attempt to create a home that lives in harmony with the environment, protects native plants and animals, and does not use resources faster than we can replenish them. Our community will be integrated with the land, and we will source our materials for building mainly on-site. We will have our own water supply (fresh water spring) and work towards being completely self-sufficient (growing food, raising animals, water collection, solar power, and composting toilets).

We believe in non-violent communication, compassion and radical honesty. Our goal is to contribute to a positive transformation of the world through open and honest communication. We believe in Anarchy, however, each Member will be held to their own Personal Responsibility. This means: committing to shared labor, attending community meetings, accepting the consequences of your actions, and resolving and amending whatever harm your actions might cause. We will participate in circle processes, regular meetings, and practice positive conflict resolution methods.

We are accepting of a wide range of alternative lifestyles, and are seeking Members who are open-minded, non-judgmental and accepting of other’s beliefs and choices and are looking for others who would like to join together to form an Intentional Community

Currently, we are 29/F, 31/M, 22/F

NOTE: We are still in the process of purchasing the land. We intend to launch in June 2018. We are working on building a website with an application for Residency.</description>

We are creating a sustainable polycultural forest garden with an emphasis on healthy soil forming, building energy efficient natural structures, regenerating and stewarding environmentally damaged areas and protecting wild habitats. This natural earth-friendly ecosystem energizes people on all levels and allows for personal and group endeavors, as well as shares and returns the surplus of energy and knowledge.

We are sharing our experiences and knowledge in areas such as seeds, nursery plants, whole nutrient-dense plant-based foods, medicinal and culinary herbs and mushrooms, efficient heating sources and natural structures, ecological land and soil food web design consulting, and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-wild-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-wild-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Wild Cooperative is an education and demonstration site in Western Colorado. In the spirit of biocentrism and collaboration, this site is offering creative space for workshops, activism, and community-building. Our vision is to be surrounded by energy efficient homes, perennial food forest gardens, healthy soils and clean reliable water. Just as we design this resilient system on the ground we nurture similarly supportive social, economic, cultural, and educational guilds.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23095&quot;&gt;Dry Gulch Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Dry Gulch Ecovillage teaches individual responsibility for self, society, and nature via the School of Intentioneering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/dry-gulch-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/dry-gulch-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Dry Gulch Ecovillage began in 2014 with the intent to grow a cooperative and ecological urban community. While many people have come and gone, a few have stayed, creating a partial income-sharing core-group. While our transient residents are less involved, we hope to eventually have all our rooms occupied by people who affirm their participation in the Dry Gulch Ecovillage. Our partial income-sharing results in a class-harmony cofamily, creating an urban community while planning two rural ecovillages, a community land trust and a land cooperative, providing options for living increasingly ecological lifestyles.

The Dry Gulch Ecovillage is home to an educational initiative called the School of Intentioneering, presenting and explaining the intentional communities movement of gifting and sharing cultures via print and soon also video media.

Other Dry Gulch initiatives include the Utopia Writer’s Guild for collaborative media productions, and Partnership Spirituality evolving patriarchal religions toward egalitarian religion, incorporating women's spirituality by deifying Mary of Magdala the same way as was Jesus of Nazareth, by simply saying it is so, then for believers, so it is!

The School of Intentioneering affirms 2027 as a convergence year of two-millennia of the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, and of two centuries since the invention of the term &quot;socialism,&quot; first printed in the Owenite journal &quot;The London Cooperative Magazine&quot; of 1827. 19th and 20th century Christian Socialism evolves in the 21st century into Partnership Spirituality, affirming class-harmony community as Jesus taught and as the Owenite communities practiced, opposed to the class-conflict of Marxist communism. Partnership Spirituality affirms the &quot;co-family&quot; of 3-to-9 unrelated adults with or without children, different from single-parent, nuclear, and extended families.

Dry Gulch initiatives support people in designing and enjoying the cooperative-ecological lifestyle of their choice.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23097&quot;&gt;Unique Community Name Number 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Sharing and Caring.

Each one, Teach One.

Not relying on systems of oppression.

Being self reliant.

Having FUN!,      .....no for real though, life should be fun.  Hard work can be FUN!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/unique-community-name-number-5/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/unique-community-name-number-5/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I purchased 40 acres in a rural valley, 4 miles from the shores of Lake Superior.  I helped restart a coop house in Madison, WI.  That inspired me to want to eventually live in an intentional community in the country side. 

 No masters, no leaders, but sharing and caring.  Creating different systems to slowly detach from the &quot;dominat&quot; culture systems most are raised to rely on.


For now, Spring 2018, it is a mostly &quot;raw&quot; piece of land.  Although it has been a farm off and on for 100 years.
Amenities include, a 40ft by 60ft cinder block garage, some animal pens, a driveway, grid electricity, a working well, and 15+ acres of open land, with a slight slope.

Several &quot;old timers&quot; in the area say it is a sweet parcel, and I agree. 

There is also a small creek that runs year round through the southern part of the land.

The southern and western boundaries are public land.  What the owned acres may lack in old big trees, are in the vast, surrounding public forest.  Those trees, County owned, connect to State land, that in turn connect to National forest.  Trees for days!

Some currants, hazelnuts, and chestnuts were planted last year, 2017.  There is also a thriving grape vine, a few black berry patches, and several apple trees sprinkled around.

For now, I am making the payments, getting the garden area going, and growing.  I would like to share it with like minded people.

DIY and DIF. 
I love traditional, primitive skills.  You know, one people did with their hands and minds before the computer space phone came about.  Doing things with friends and loved ones I find to be better then hiring someone to do it for you.  Push your comfort, and you can gain comfort.

Permaculture possibilities are abound, due to the slight and sever slopes the land has.  Potential potential potential.

Organic standards are a pretty good idea.  Following the Iroquois standard of 7 generations seems like a good idea too.</description>

      <name>Natura Regenerative Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23099&quot;&gt;Natura Regenerative Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To build a regenerative community where people can live and work, holistically, in harmony with each other and nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/natura-regenerative-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/natura-regenerative-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Natura, regenerative community is in existence to help build and help people live up to their full
potential while enhancing the natural environment. This can be achieved through the practice of permaculture, which is based on three core principals: care for Earth – so all life can continue, care for people – by providing the resources necessary for existence and return of surplus – so systems remain productive and stable.

Natura is in the business of regenerative community development providing health and happiness for the residents and the surrounding environment. Natura is currently developing a 30-acre parcel of land located a short walk to amenities in the Town of Bridgewater, Lunenburg County on Nova Scotia’s south shore. The community will consist of sixteen detached and semi-detached residential units and shared community buildings including: a community kitchen, a year-round greenhouse, a recreation center, a wood/metal workshop, a retail store, and, a treehouse. Many shared outdoor spaces will be developed such as: food forests, contoured and raised bed food gardens, an engineered wetland, a natural swimming pool, a playground, a sports field, a court, and walking/biking trails. Members of the community will be free to grow their own food and make their own products, which can be sold at the community store, one of many business opportunities. This community will be less dependant on motorized vehicles with it’s nearness to amenities so walking, biking, and vehicle sharing can be practiced which will help to lower the carbon footprint. Residents living here can live a holistic lifestyle in harmony with nature.

The houses and most shared buildings in this community will be off grid using clean, renewable energy sources for power generation including: passive/active solar, wind, water, compost heat, hydrogen, and plant-based biofuels. Natural building construction will be employed including: hempcrete, straw bale, light straw clay, earthbag, earthen floor/wall finishes, rammed earth, cob, stone masonry, round pole timber framing, branchwood, and the use of reclaimed lumber. Natural resources found on the site will be utilized for building construction as efficiently as possible.

Water conservation methods will be practiced including: rainwater capture for potable water usage and plant irrigation, grey water recapture and reuse, and the use of composting toilets.

Forested areas will be well managed using such practices as: tree harvesting for lumber and poles, decomposing logs for horticulture and mushroom cultivation, transplanting of smaller trees to be removed, silviculture for healthy tree growth, cultivation for coppicing of select tree species, planting of food forest areas, and planting of deciduous trees for summer shading, planting of coniferous trees for weather protection and future harvesting, and planting of vegetation for erosion and flood control.

Small-scale agriculture will be a main focus for the community providing most of the food consumption needs for the residents. Fruits, berries, and vegetables will be grown in abundance using the permaculture principles with no petrochemical pesticides or herbicides needed. Food needs will be met throughout the year using such methods as: growing out of season in year-round heated greenhouses and using other season extenders like hoop tunnels, unheated greenhouses, and cold frames. Food preservation will also be practiced using such methods as: cold room storage, freezing, dehydrating, and canning to insure abundant food stores throughout the winter months. Seed saving will be practiced to insure a supply of quality, non-gmo seeds for healthy food production. Beekeeping will be done in the community for honey production to be used on it’s own or in other honey-based food products, as well as products made from beeswax. Small-scale livestock will also be kept for eggs, meat, and dairy needs. Healthy soil will be produced and maintained in such ways as: screening topsoil from excavated job sites for use in gardens, aerobic and anaerobic composting methods, and the production of biochar.

Many products will be produced and sold through the community store including: food products, transplants, craft items, natural cleaning products and natural personal care products. The store will also serve to balance surpluses and shortages of products consumed by residents. Other locally produced natural products in demand by residents will be sold through the store to satisfy the needs of the community. The store will also be a means of income that will help support financial needs of the co-op.

Transportation for community residents will be more efficient and less polluting than conventional means. Walking, biking, carpooling, and vehicle sharing will be practiced and encouraged. Types of motorized vehicles may include: electric, pedal/electric hybrid, hydrogen fuel cell/electric hybrid, biofuel/electric hybrid, compressed air, and biofuel conversions. All types of electric vehicles can be charged on site with clean renewable energy. The community will be committed to staying on the leading edge with the use of cleaner and less polluting means of transportation.

Other businesses that may be owned and operated by the co-op may include: home rental units, alternative power systems sales and installation, hemp product manufacturing, electric vehicle sales and repair, holistic health practices, and holistic childcare. All businesses can benefit the community co-op as a whole by providing product and service needs of the residents and providing sources of revenue for shareholders.

Natura Community Co-op will also be a learning center and provide education and training in many areas such as: permaculture design, organic food production and preserving, natural building, and alternative power generation. Natura Community Co-op aims to be a model neighborhood for sustainable, holistic living, which will help people to reconnect with nature and more fully realize their own humanity. This co-op will be committed to nurturing health, happiness, and vitality for all of life as we help to heal our beautiful planet. The co-op will help people to realize that the basic
needs of human beings can be met in abundance for generations to come if learn to understand and care for our planet and everything she has to offer. We can leave behind a legacy that our children and grandchildren can be proud of.</description>

We strive as a community to develop and use sustainable technology and self contained systems for all applications. We have a strong focus on teamwork, consent and non-violent negotiations. We acknowledge and accept all genders and forms of gender expression and sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/solis-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/solis-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Solis Community is a young, forming community comprising of 3 adults in their 30s and 1 child, renting a 4 bedroom house on 6 acres on the outskirts of Perth, Western Australia.
Our goal is to rehabilitate the property which has been heavily farmed and turn it into a permaculture food forest to feed the community. We also have the opportunity to build tiny houses, yurts and tepees and park caravans and campers. We intend to set up external kitchen, bathroom and laundry facilities but those facilities are already available in the house so clean up and planting are the current priorities.
We also intend to fund solar power, water collection systems and a bore pump.
There are 2 rooms still empty in the house and a number of suitable places to park or build a tiny home.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23104&quot;&gt;Sentient Meat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Sentient Meat is a non-profit organization registered in Ohio that represents a collective of artist across all disciplines. Our mission is to foster growth for communities and artists through creative partnership, performance, and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sentient-meat/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sentient-meat/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our organization is centered around the idea that people work better together, and that artists work better when we’re not denied access to valuable, necessary resources that we need to subsist. Supporting art supports the community in ways that are real and tangible, and when art is treated as the important work that it is, the benefits reach far beyond the individuals creating it.

In a society where art and artists are often devalued and social safety nets are heavily restricted and even more heavily stigmatized, it’s important to organize and create the resources we need to support each other and let communal effort prevail. We aid in this process by driving programs for artist residency and easy access to necessary tools for development and creation: opportunities for education and collaboration, space for working and presenting, and more.

It’s a vast, cold, uncaring world out there. But as sci-fi fan writer Arthur D. Hiavaty once said, the whole point of society is that it’s supposed to be less unforgiving than nature. We have the ability to be more and to make it better by accepting each other and letting communal effort prevail. That’s where we come in.</description>

We have a potluck dinner together once a week, and periodic work days to clear leaves and keep the common space safe.  All the land is co-owned by the community, and we each have rights of access over all of it.  It's really a lovely place, and so unique to be so close to downtown, with its arts, culture, food, and public transportation.</description>

      <name>Bright Moments Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23108&quot;&gt;Bright Moments Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Primary to our community focus is a proactive approach to mental health and personal growth and the establishment of high functioning relationships based upon what we call dynamic connection. Generally, we're looking to join with others to create a safe, connected, healthy, multi-generational, and sustainable community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bright-moments-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bright-moments-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;“What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others.” Pericles

In A Nutshell…
We are looking for others interested in discussing the creation of an intentional cooperative community. What follows is intended to give those who may be interested in joining us a little background on our perspectives, interests, and values.

A Sad State of Affairs…
Unfortunately, it is our opinion that we live in a society that is very sick. Politically, we are divided and seemingly incapable of sane governance by and for the people; Economically, the wealthiest 1% of Americans own more than 40% of the nation’s wealth, while the vast majority— around 80%, only own 7% of the wealth; Socially, we are increasingly intolerant of other cultural traditions, racial diversity, as well as gender and sexuality identifications, while hate speech, hate crimes, and mass killings are at an all-time high. Society is diseased and dysfunctional… and society is us.

Meanwhile, recent studies have revealed that approximately half of Americans are lonely or isolated, with many feeling that their relationships lack meaning. It’s interesting to consider that throughout human history we have lived in groups—clans, tribes, and extended families—and there are many cultures in the world that still live this way today. But, somehow, over time and generations, we got caught up in the American dream, with our nuclear families in homogenous neighborhoods and, generally, isolated lifestyles with all the consumer trappings we could ever imagine.

Now, it seems that many of us experience life as casualties of the so-called American dream: more socially isolated; devoting most of our lives to toil and drudgery in unfulfilling jobs; politically frustrated and disconnected; finding that all the technology, electronics, and things we work so hard to afford don’t really make us happy; and feeling stuck. American dream? Or nightmare!

We are also faced with extremely serious environmental challenges at this time, especially with many of our so-called leaders’ willingness to foolishly trash our natural heritage and trade in our ultimate survival for the short-sighted gains of industry and more short-term wealth for the top one percent! With everything from global warming to pollution and threats to our food supply, clean water, and clean air, how can we turn a blind eye and not be examples of the change that is needed?

Whether it’s the foods we eat, the products we use, the cars we drive, or the practices we support, we can make choices that support healthy ecosystems, environmental balance, and sustainability. The Earth is our home. We need to take care of it for our children and future generations. It is beyond irresponsible, like completely crazy, to do otherwise.

Why Intentional Community?
If any of this is ever going to get better, we will need to make some changes! Can we overcome our addictions to uncontrolled consumerism and learn to work together with mutual respect, love, and kindness for each other’s well-being and the greater good? Yes we can!

By joining together and sharing skills and resources, we can be part of the change that this world needs in order to survive. We can dramatically lessen our environmental footprint by sharing, everything from vehicles to washing machines! We can also collaborate and work together to create innovative new sources of income, allowing participants to pursue work that is creative and meaningful.

More About Us…
We are two people (female and male) looking for individuals, couples, or small family groups to join us. We would eventually like to be a group of at least ten to twelve members. Our preferred age-range for co-founders is 30’s to 60’s. We would like to connect with those who are generally positive, focused, energetic, fun-loving, and who share similar values and interests to ours.

Things We Value…

• Proactive, open, inclusive communication

• Building meaningful relationships based upon transparency and dynamic connection

• Physically active and healthy lifestyle

• Mental/emotional health advocacy

• Natural, non-GMO, organic, sustainable food production

• Sustainable/ecological decision-making

• Freedom to pursue creative and educational interests

• Equality, tolerance, diversity, respect, kindness

• Positive attitudes towards personal expression and sexuality

• Enjoying music, dancing, food, companionship, seizing the day, and celebrating life

• Living with creative intention, mindfulness, and self-responsibility

• Seeing life as a journey and an ongoing opportunity for exploration, experience, and understanding

Things that interest us…

• Establishing an intentional community with shared and separate living spaces, as well as shared facilities, common areas, gardens, etc.

• Establishing collective business ventures that add value to the lives of those involved, the community, and the community-at-large

• Creating a safe, connected, healthy, multi-generational, and sustainable community

• The ability for (eventual) elderly members to age-in-place and remain full and active participants in the community as much as possible

• Extended/alternative family structures

Regarding Mental/Emotional Health Advocacy…
It is estimated that 1 in 4 of us have immediate mental health conditions requiring treatment of some kind. But what about the other 75% of us? Just because we are able to function in our daily lives doesn’t mean we don’t have issues! We all need help at times dealing with relationships and communication issues, habits, behaviors, attitudes, making healthy choices, resolving conflicts, as well as things like self-esteem, confidence, and  self-empowerment.

Mental and emotional health counseling and therapy, as well as other self-help and empowerment practices, is what healthy people do! We are not only a part of this crazy human drama, we have steeped in it for many years, unconsciously absorbing whatever attitudes, beliefs, perspectives, assumptions, and behaviors were around us or were psychologically convenient. What’s wrong with acknowledging the craziness and dysfunction and accepting that we all have issues and we can all do better?

Attending counseling or therapy sessions still has negative connotations for many people. We may see ourselves doing as well or even better than people we know, and overall, we are functioning fairly well in our day-to-day lives, so why do we need help? There is usually an assumption that something has to be very wrong to require seeing a mental health professional. Unfortunately, this type of attitude prevents many of us from engaging in a process that can lead to increased self-awareness, better communication, higher functioning relationships, and happier, more expansive lives.

We are all, potentially, extraordinary people, capable of extraordinary things. Why not be proactive in dealing with our psycho/social/emotional functions when it will only benefit us (and those around us)? Why not take a closer look at our behaviors and attitudes and understand in a deeper way how they directly influence our own lives and affect others? Why not learn how to improve the ways we communicate? Why not learn how to be better listeners and be more emotionally supportive of the people we love? Why not learn how to be better partners in our primary relationships? 

We believe that transparency is important in relationships, in general. We think that transparency is especially important when it comes to building a trusting high-functioning group of multiple adults, from many different cultures and backgrounds, with no previous connections to each other. How can we be transparent with each other if we’re not able to be transparent with ourselves? 

We think that building a successful intentional community requires interpersonal skills far beyond what is considered “normal.” We need to become very good at listening, questioning, taking turns, understanding each other, supporting each other, resolving conflicts, solving problems, focusing and following through on tasks, saying what we mean and meaning what we say, being accountable and self-responsible, and being able to work towards something beyond our own wants and needs.

Some Basic Assumptions?
• We can accomplish much more by working together, than we can alone
• We can experience a higher quality of life by sharing resources and engaging in activities that contribute to the greater good
• We can all make a difference
• We are much happier when we experience connection and develop relationships that have depth and meaning, based on transparency and trust
• We are more fulfilled when we connect in meaningful ways
• Time is an illusion; time is of the essence; there’s no time like the present
• This life is a tremendous and brief opportunity for us to seize
• We each have tremendous creative potential
• This life is ours to explore, understand, creatively define, and celebrate
• Once we learn to be connected to ourselves, we can be more effective
• Many of us need help to understand and heal our fragmented psyches and behaviors
• There is no shame in needing a little help

“Are you in earnest? Seize this very minute
What you can do, or dream you can, begin it;
Boldness has genius, power, magic in it.
Only engage, and then the mind grows heated;
Begin and then the work will be completed.”
(Johann Wolfgang von Goethe)

Recommended Reading…
We have found this article (link below) very helpful in understanding the “pathology of normalcy,” which illustrates and details the societal pathology (sickness/disease briefly mentioned earlier) and its origins that is pervasive and normal in our society today. We think it is extremely important to share this understanding and perspective with anyone who may be interested in developing healthier alternatives to the current societal model.

Changing the way things are at the macro level will, likely, take a very long time and many generations of us. But, we have the opportunity to start now and get the ball rolling to create something better! A new paradigm is needed and there are people like us all over the world working to make it happen.

Some may find this article a little challenging, as it is longish (equivalent of about 22 typed pages of about 500 words each) and written by an academic. However, once you get started it reads very well and though one might want to look one or two things up, it really isn’t too bad! We encourage you to set a little time aside and check it out…

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23110&quot;&gt;Woodsy Way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Friends living in community together and enjoying life, striving towards a joyous sustainable existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/woodsy-way/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/woodsy-way/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We aspire to be a small coliving community of friends who enjoy practicing permaculture together.  We have had a lot of joy in living with others in the past, gardening, playing board games, cooking awesome food together, playing music.  We hope to welcome others into our lives who are looking for the same.  We are especially hoping to find people who have land based ambitions which we can help to meet.  

Steve is a mathematician, Lorna is a veterinarian. We are both interested in math and science, sustainable living, board games, singing, playing instruments. Steve plays brazilian jiujitsu. Lorna is into dog training. We are pretty fun people to hang out with. 

Existing Infrastructure:

We have a few fenced acres planted with nut trees on 40' centers (chestnut, hickory, heartnut, butternut, pecan, black walnut english walnut), and fruit trees (pawpaw, persimmon, juneberry, seabuckthorn, apple, asian pear, etc).  These trees are all just yearlings right now.  Irrigation system is in place for these plants.  If yield tables are correct, we should be able to get all of our calories from these plantings in around a decade (for about 8 people).

We have a very nice little house with 3 bedrooms.  We occupy one of the bedrooms, and are open to single people, couples, triads or whatever filling the remaining two rooms.

We are also planning on improving the house with most of our excess wages.  Adding superinsultion, making the house all electric, adding solar panels, getting a solar vehicle etc.

Some caveats:

We both do not drink alcohol, smoke, or do any drugs. We are not interested in living with anyone who does: sorry about that! We are friends with people who do, no judgement, just would prefer not to live in a context where these things are present.

We are both pretty liberal. Open to being friends with, and living with people with differing political views, but you would have to enjoy arguing about this stuff if so (which we would be fine with!).

Also, while we have not planted any GMOs we are also open to the idea of planting GMOs (for instance, the CUNY GMO American chestnut). We also use Roudnup to control some persistent perennial weeds on our property.  We are open to accepting people with different views on this, and in the spirit of consensus based decision making we would be willing to stop using roundup/ not plant any GMOs if we can manage without them. Hopefully this is not a deal breaker!</description>

With sanctuary at our heart, we aim to be a steadfast presence of peace and justice for all, while living close to the Earth.

MISSION: To be a loving sanctuary to animal-persons and to advocate for all by being a place of education, service, and self-sustaining growth through positive action and affirmation. With learning and sharing via workshops, broader community engagement and personal example, the community uplifts and inspires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/peacebird-animal-liberation-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/peacebird-animal-liberation-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We’re an established farm sanctuary and vegan agri-tourism destination in Ontario (established 2005) currently taking this project to the next step and converting the land and sanctuary into an intentional interspecies community as a vegan ecovillage. http://peacebird.org/</description>

      <name>Green Acres Permaculture Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23112&quot;&gt;Green Acres Permaculture Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; GREEN ACRES PERMACULTURE VILLAGE is a small, retrofit, intergenerational intentional community in a core suburban college town neighborhood that integrates self-knowledge and expression with a shared culture among humans and the living Earth to encourage abundance on every level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/green-acres-permaculture-village-current/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/green-acres-permaculture-village-current/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;GREEN ACRES PERMACULTURE VILLAGE is a retrofit intergenerational intentional community carved from within an existing suburban neighborhood in college town. The evolving Village, currently featuring three adjacent homes and permacultured grounds, with pathways and commons areas (two greenhouses, a workshop space, chicken house, shed, patio) offers itself as a template for transformation of suburban life. 

Village rhythms feature both work and play. Offering workshops, work days, weekly Community Dinners, and Seasonal Celebrations, we both integrate internally and promote outreach to the larger community. To this end, we offer tours, plus sponsor and encourage WWOOFers, including Indiana University Interns and Sustainability Classes, to demonstrate and promote values that lie below money as far as possible. To this end we keep rents low, work together on projects, encourage each other’s self-expression and entrepreneurial skills, honor our communion with the living Earth, and aim to live and work in place inside a sharing economy that values both individual expression and community cooperation. 

Established in 2009 by founder Ann Kreilkamp who dedicated her own yard for a Green Acres Neighborhood Garden, both our sense of community and our capacity for growing food have evolved organically over time. In 2014 Rebecca Ellsworth, an organic gardener for 40 years, joined us, and from then on, the cultivation and preservation of food and value-added products for both Village use and sales, including a small CSA, have taken hold.

In 2017 we were invited to establish a permaculture garden behind the house of a neighbor in exchange for part of the produce, and plan to offer this service to others in the Green Acres neighborhood.
  
Early in 2018 we created a ten-member Village Board that is now researching legal structures to determine which type will best meet our needs as we go forward. We expect to add houses and grounds to the Village over time.

Green Acres Permaculture Village is networked with the Green Acres Neighborhood Association, Dandelion Village, Bloomington Co-operative Living, Bloomington Council of Neighborhood Associations, the Association for Regenerative Culture, NuMundo, and the Federation of Intentional Communities.</description>

We are also a proving ground for developing eco-friendly technology and innovative construction.

Both residential and guest facilities will be ADA-compliant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/strowler-enterprises/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/strowler-enterprises/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The property draws its primary supporting revenue from hosting large crowd events such as festival camping, equestrians, SCA &amp;amp; LARPing, veteran's retreats, spiritual gatherings, weddings, theatrical/music shows, and sex-positive groups. Cabins designed for alter-abled access will be a prominent and unique feature. 

On-site stables, adirondack platforms, and permanent biffies with running water and showers are planned campsite amenities.  A small (200-300 seating) amphitheater performance stage is planned for shows.  Premium cabins and tree-houses based on custom fantasy and sci-fi designs will draw additional tourism.  As resident owners, we are responsible for maintaining guest facilities.

We will keep livestock and a garden to supplement our food.  At first, it will be neccesary for members to keep their outside employment.  Combined with the initial revenue, building up the infrastructure will happen rapidly.  As we become less dependent on outside income, the event space will generate all supporting revenue, to make profit-sharing possible.  Our business model is designed to become self-supporting within five years.</description>

-An Intentional Jesus Christ Centered Community

 

A place to Grow, a place to Serve, a place to Disciple.

 

“Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!”
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭133:1‬ ‭KJV



What is an Intentional Community?

“A community designed and planned around a social ideal or collective values and interests, often involving shared resources and responsibilities. A group of people living together for specific purpose or reason.” 

A typical Neighborhood is a Community by default. People live in close proximity to each other but do not have a Shared Intention, they just happen to be there. Neighbors may never talk to each other. Neighbors may only see each other when they come in and out of the driveway in their car. It just so happens that neighbors live next to each other. The lack of Common Purpose for being there is something to be overcome. When there is Shared Purpose for why people live in a certain place, then the Community has a solid foundation. 

Where there is an agreed upon Common Purpose for why people are living in a place and they are in Collective Pursuit of the Mission, Intentional Community is found.

 

In our present state of Christianity the majority of people meet for about 2 hours on a sunday coming from other cities/towns, states, and even sometimes countries to come together for a common purpose(worshiping and learning more about God). 

In the early church of Church of Christ, it was not so.
Acts 2:37-47
“Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?

Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. And all that believed were together, and had all things common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.”  

Acts 4:32-37
“And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, And laid them down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need. And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.”

The people of God are Stronger together and are capable of much more when operating in Unity.

Walking As Christ is planning to unite with other Brothers and Sisters in Christ whom are fully devoted to the Lord and acquire a property that is nearly 200 acres in San Diego County California USA, in or around December 2018 establishing the Community of Christians. 

Core Values of The Community 
Local presence and Global Community 
As we pursue Growth in our walk with Jesus Christ, serving the Lord Daily, and Discipling others we will do so collectively from our Local Community as the Headquarters for the work that we do Globally. Physical location in Southern California with Brothers and Sisters in Christ abroad following Jesus Christ and serving the Lord with us.


Embracing Diversity and Empowering Unity 
Followers of Jesus Christ from various backgrounds and denominations living and working together for the greater good of the Body of Christ. The Community of Christians is not to be governed by any denomination or religious institution. The Community will embrace and welcome followers of Jesus Christ from various backgrounds/denominations. 
Whether; Southern Baptist, Reformed, Pentecostal, Orthodox, Catholic, Non-Denominational, or any other Christian group that Preaches/Teaches Jesus Christ and Rebukes sin you are welcome here. This is a mission for all of the called of God around the world. The Mission of this Community is Fulfilling the Will of God and Edifying His people across the Globe.

This indeed is a beautiful representation of everything we hope to embody on our homestead.  The idea of a fireplace brings about ideas of the home and hearth; representative of the warmth and love needed to &quot;fuel&quot; a family. We have always dreamed of finding our true home so that we could bring our children up in the most ideal environment.</description>

      <name>Grimm Acres Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23118&quot;&gt;Grimm Acres Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; ​Since you can't have an intentional community without intention, ours is to simply &quot;thrive together&quot;.

Everyone who lives or visits Grimm Acres brings a lifetime of experience to share with others. Even the children have unique experiences, perspectives and skills to offer and teach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/grimm-acres-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/grimm-acres-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Grimm Acres Community Living, is a beautiful place to put down some roots, enjoy nature, explore the simple life, a time for quiet reflection, and be a part of a community that works together to achieve community goals.

Grimm Acres is a wonderful place to be at one with nature, animals, birds, and the trees that surround us. While at the same time each member of the community can engage in meaningful work. Creating tiny living shelters, discovering nature trails, creating healthy gardens to grow community food, animal husbandry, and discovering the meaning of community as we all work side by side together.

Grimm Acres is the best place to rediscover who you are, who you want to be, and where you want to be in life. Here you can learn new things, become a part of a community that is sustainable and self-sufficient, be able to help others, and journey with peace.

Living simply is the Grimm Acres way, and understanding that our place here on earth is to learn and help others learn in the process. We embrace learning new things, learning from others, and understand that many great minds can achieve much more than just one great mind.

Teaching our local community on gardening, identifying plants, trees, canning, building simple shelters, and how working as a community can enhance the lives around you.

Orion and Josie Grimm settled in Waynesburg, KY. Both with the vision of creating a place full of family, love, and a sense of community. Understanding that in today's tough economic times, how cool it would be to open up their homestead to others to create an intentional community that relishes in the simple things of life. Creating a place where others could enjoy the beauty that surrounds them, garden together, raise animals together, build together, and eventually become a self-sustained intentional community. After all, it takes a village. Troy and Dawn have lived in communities, such as Alpha Farm in Oregon and were invited to Grimm Acres ​as part of the core group with their children, Heather and Ivy.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23119&quot;&gt;The Xperiment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Today we are members of a civilization, which is getting ever more exhausted not only in terms of resource management systems, forms of government and political will for change, but above all in terms of basic human connection – our ability to communicate honestly and emotionally among each other and with the environment.
Both as individuals and as species we are standing on the edge of a cliff in all important aspects of our existence – environmentally, economically, socially and spiritually. Many (actually most) of us are in a state of free fall, whether we realize it or not. However, one thing is certain – we are becoming more and more aware of these issues – whether with our minds, souls or hearts, simply because they form our reality. Today!
Regardless of where we live on the planet, the everyday lives of most of us consist of endless wandering between the elements of our decaying social, economic and political systems and our own internal struggles for self-awareness and search for meaning, friendship and love…
If any of this sounds familiar to you, if in any way those thoughts and emotions are also in your mind and soul, if you feel time has come for you to look for a change from this reality, then you are standing at the doorstep of one of the places where this is possible.
After all, change is a matter of choice. We already made ours.
This is the place where YOU can also make this choice.
Let’s reinvent our lives TOGETHER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-xperiment/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-xperiment/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This project’s goal is to create an international social and cultural center, combined with sustainable lifestyle amidst the beautiful nature of the Balkan mountain.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23121&quot;&gt;Common Ground Community Knoxville TN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Vibrant living in the Third Act of life. Our mission statement is under development as future residents collaborate through Summer, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/common-ground-community-knoxville-tn/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/common-ground-community-knoxville-tn/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Begun in April, 2016 as a 'good idea' by a small group who'd not yet heard of &quot;cohousing,&quot; Common Ground formally launched in January, 2017.  In May, 2017 two of our group attended the National Cohousing Conference in Nashville, including one spending a day with Chuck Durrett and the developers of Quimper Village. Now, after a hiatus of a few months later that year, we are moving ahead with an ambitious time line.  Common Ground Community announces the opportunity to become a member of the first UU [Unitarian Universalist-founded] senior cohousing project in America outside CA (hat tip to Glacier Circle). A 22-acre parcel is currently under contract in northeast Knoxville, TN in a beautiful natural hillside setting less than 15 minutes to downtown and views of the Smokies. This kind of intentional neighborhood is one of the best choices for those concerned about loneliness, isolation, and the challenges of aging (with nod to Dr. Bill Thomas and appreciation of Dr. Atul Gawande's &quot;Being Mortal&quot; perspective). 

We are using a successfully tested senior cohousing model, that of Elderspirit (Abingdon, VA), which permits individuals to have an ideal balance of private space and mutual support and connection in community. Quimper Village in WA has also been an inspiration, and our friends in Germantown Commons (TN's first cohousing community) have been terrific allies. Common Ground is incorporating universal design and other features to support intentional, mindful community development and cooperative living.</description>

It will be made up of 8-12 community members that will do nearly everything together except work. During business hours everyone will go out to their individual jobs in the community.

To free ourselves from depression, anxiety, and avoidance we will make and follow a detailed schedule every day. We will wake up, exercise, cook and eat breakfast, have a morning check in, go to work, cook and eat dinner, have a group therapy session, and have planning and practical meetings. 

This community is for people who want to stop escaping their life and start living life to its fullest! As such we will seek to avoid escapist behavior such as drugs, mass media and entertainment, binge-eating, etc. Technology will be sharply curtailed in the house. There will be no TV except for special occasions. Laptops and phones are allowed but they are only to be used for specific tasks and not for entertainment.

Many people with severe social anxiety and depression also suffer from other conditions such as general anxiety, ADHD, bipolar, body image issues, self harm, drug addiction etc. When you first come to the community you may already have a job or you may be in such a state that you are unemployable. We will build you up and in a few months you will be ready to get a job.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23123&quot;&gt;PNW Partnership&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our primary focus is just co-buying a large chunk of land to farm and garden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/pnw-partnership/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/pnw-partnership/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hey, friends. My name is Dani. My goal in life is to own several acres with a stream where I can run my nursery and live sustainably. I have been searching for land for what feels like forever, coming up short every time. I'm sure you've noticed that land over here is not cheap! That's where this thought comes in: sharing a lot of acreage with another small family or two. 

I'm starting to notice the more area, the lower the price per acre. Cool, right?! Yes and no. I have a specific budget that I'm trying to stay under and am really thinking that I should just find an ecovillage/homestead/land partner to co-sign with me on a land loan.

Here's an example: Let's say I found 30 acres on the Olympic Peninsula for $140,000. My credit union requires a 25% down payment for raw land. That would be $35,000. Realistically, who's got that much money stashed aside? Not this lady! Alright, so let's split that 30 acres three ways -- 10 acres a piece! Now that $35,000 is looking easier to achieve with a $11,667 down payment from each buyer instead. $140,000 split up in three is only $46,667 which is actually quite a steal for 10 acres with a stream in the Olympic Peninsula.

So if you've got at least $14,000 saved and you're actively searching for land to purchase, maybe we can help one another out! I'm just a plant lady trying to live life and stay positive. Let's connect.</description>

Hoping to reach some awesome folks who'd be interested in collaborating with me because all projects are done better together! Number of folks that could be intrinsically involved will depend on the property, but right now, I'm putting out feelers for a founding group of 3-4 folks that have some money they'd like to invest in a dreamy space! I am deeply in love with community and I want to make a little community with you!

Some ideas I have for the space:
Non-profit driven
Music venue
Community space
Workshop/meet-up space
Cafe/bar
Garden
Flowers
Local market</description>

We created the Farming Artists LLC to acquire access to a 133 acre farm property that had been in one family for 5 generations. The LLC currently holds the land in a 4 year agriculture lease with option to purchase agreement.  We have drafted extensive operating agreements and in intend to share the land in perpetuity among 9 family homesteads of 2 acres each.  We also intend to lease to several resident owned businesses both independently and cooperatively structured. Our core values are centered upon learning to live in right relationship with the natural world and with other human beings.</description>

A real place we create together by being ourselves.

Inclined to favor a very simple modest reality based existence. Ecologically focused with the aim to actually be living on this actual Earth now. So a rural location with some intact natural plant and animal community. 
Basic needs focused, means growing food and foraging. access to water.

Coming together we can be truly present, healing ourselves and enjoying the real planet we live on.
A grounded Indigenous and/or Tao understanding or interest is appreciated.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23129&quot;&gt;Liberty Ship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; This community is focused on providing an environment for individuals to build comfort and stability in their own lives. We offer various living arrangements for people to make specialized contributions of their labor, in exchange for a place to live inexpensively, and with plenty of privacy and autonomy. The household atmosphere is quiet and reflective. A focus on self improvement is strongly encouraged. We try to match each member with a labor commitment that they genuinely enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/liberty-ship/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/liberty-ship/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a couple that bought a large house on a half acre in the suburbs of Klamath Falls. The property was owned by a married couple for 40 years until the end of their lives, and their enormous contribution of personal energy shows all over the property. It's too much for us to take on alone. One of us operates an online business to pay the house bills, and the other does all the fixing and remodeling. We are transforming the property slowly into a collective community of individuals, each of whom contributes some hours of their favorite labor in lieu of some rent. Individuals need to have their own income, but it can be modest. 

As of Aprill 2018, we have a renter who prepares meals as her work trade. This will always be a position in the community, as neither owner is inclined to cooking. She will probably move on early 2019, at which point we will need a replacement kitchen magicworker. 

Our current primary focus is our child, and we are hoping to find another family or single parent with children around the same age (6 yrs) to cohabitate. Our daughter is homeschooled, brilliant, and lonely for kid interaction. The ideal match is someone who wants to take on a little more than their fair share of the child supervising, in exchange for below-market rent ($300 util included) in one of the main bedrooms. 

We also have a huge established garden we need someone to take over. We can offer summer and fall tent space in the yard for someone to take that on; veggies and yard care. If you would like use of the house, we would ask $100 a month for your utilities. We would like to have periodic flocks of meat chickens for household food, too. The owners have black thumbs and need help in this arena.

Finally, there is a large area in our unfinished basement, and a very well built shed in the yard that could be converted to additional living space. One of the owners is extremely handy, but there is very much work to do in the house and we can always use additional help. If you are eager to learn about home repair, interested in an apprenticeship, and don't mind living in an unfinished basement room, please get in touch.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23131&quot;&gt;Lifechanyuan International Family Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our vision:

This earth becomes one big family, where traditional families and countries no longer exist. There will be only one global government and all resources are shared worldwide. Everyone on earth will be able to move freely around the world and there will be no famine, wars or social unrest. The weather are always favorable; no one will pocket anything on the road and no one will need to lock their door at night. Everyone enjoys free, happy, joyous and blessed lives.



Our Mission:

To call on all individuals and groups with insight to transcend traditional family limitations and the consciousness infused by countries, so that they can become global citizens, form an international family, and eventually realize the one world collective ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/lifechanyuan-international-family-society/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/lifechanyuan-international-family-society/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Lifechanyuan International Family Society was registered successfully in British Columbia, Canada as an incorporated NPO (non-profit organization) on November 20th, 2017. 

It is located on ten-acres of farmland in Lac La Hache. The property has one wooden house with an established Bed and Breakfast which includes six guest room suites, five bedrooms, four shared toilets, a large dining room, a full kitchen, and a meeting room. The house is facing Lac La Hache lake and Highway 97 passes by it . Water, electricity, gas, and internet are all readily available.

This society will absorb people from different cultures, nations, races, countries and beliefs to form an international family. This international family will adopt the same life mode of the Second Home that Lifechanyuan had successfully created in China. The purpose of this international family is to create a new life model and sustainable future for the humanity.

The crises that people face are becoming increasingly more serious.The main crisis is that the climate change is growing more and more seriously, which causes more and more climate refugees. If this issue cannot be solved effectively, seven billion people will start fighting with each other for survival. This will also make climate change and environment destruction and social instability becoming increasingly severe and eventually lead to humanity’s enormous sufferings. Our objective of founding Lifechanyuan international family is to find a best way to lead humanity into a track of peaceful development before the catastrophic disasters happen. We will do this by assisting the United Nations, governments of all countries, relevant groups and global organizations.

We plan to build the Lifechanyuan international family to a reasonable size of between thirty (30) and three hundred (300) people and will buy more land and build more homes as their need arises.If you are interested in joining us to help create this new life mode and are willing to abide by the third edition of 800 Values for New Era Human Being, you are welcome to contribute financial support or your wisdom to this international family. Let us work toward realizing our most beautiful ideal together.

Welcome people with lofty ideals from all over the world to visit, interview and communicate with us. If you need accommodation and food, please call us in advance to appoint the date.</description>

      <name>Rainbow Acres</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23132&quot;&gt;Rainbow Acres&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Rainbow Family is known as the largest non-organization of non-members in the world. We have no leaders, and no organization. We are individuals coming together with common ideals, but not necessarily the same focus. I think it's safe to say we're into intentional community building, non-violence, and alternative lifestyles. We also believe that Peace and Love are a great thing, and we have a strong orientation to take care of the the Earth.

Each (non) member is self directed, and encouraged to follow their passion. Personally, my focus is the creation of an Edenic Botanical Preserve (the Eco-Ark Project) for useful, native and endangered species, which doubles as a horticultural nursery. This community is designed on what I call the American Freedom model. Small parcels rather than a huge place no one can afford. The Eco-Ark Project is just one endeavor on one person's parcel. Others are musicians, aqua-culturists and computer heads. Most all are into planting fruit trees and growing food. We have self rule rather having to ask for consensus from a whole group with differing ideas, hope and dreams. Personal responsibility for your own parcel payments, so one doesn't lose anyone else's home because one ran into bad luck or was too lazy to get their stuff done. If you choose to leave, you can sell your parcel and retrieve your investment. WE CAN work together and help each other with projects big and small, but we are not forced to, if someone is not reciprocating or there are personality or lifestyle conflicts. We have room to be different and live as we like, and for others to do so too, without getting in our face. Freedom for all to pursue their passions and live a self determined life.

Disclaimer: This is NOT an official document of any kind by the Rainbow Family. This page is my own creation, and as such only represents my own ideas. In no way does this mean I or anyone else represent the Rainbow Family, regardless of what anyone might say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/rainbow-acres/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/rainbow-acres/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Based on Rainbow Family values. We are ecology minded, living close to nature and nurturing her to bring forth abundance. What we are not is a gathering. We are accepting responsibility for our lives and creating them in the way we see fit. We are choosing to associate with others of like mind, for the common good. We are not a commune (though you may be if you choose). We each own and are responsible for our own parcel. Each will develop it's own flavor as different rainbow camps do. 

There really is no structure. You do not need our permission to &quot;join&quot;. Simply contact a real estate agent and find an available lot in our neighborhood. You have complete control of your investment and what you choose to focus your visions energy on. No need for consensus and endless meetings. We share our talents, energy and aloha in what interests us, and have no investment in what doesn't. All are free to do as they see fit, and share in whatever benefits are being offered.

By living together, we can lower our ecological footprint (resource use), be happier, and help to show others a better way to live!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/elko-tree-streets-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/elko-tree-streets-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Dan and Jackie (married couple) bought a large house in August of 2017 to turn into an intentional community here in the &quot;Tree Streets&quot; of Elko, NV.  They moved down from Boise, Idaho where they had maintained an intentional community for 9 years.  The community in Boise (Permacultureland) was a fabulous experience that Dan and Jackie want to replicate here in Elko, NV.  We have a strong commitment to building and fostering the development of community as the road to resolving many of the world's problems.

As community members, we often eat dinner together, share chores, and maintain open lines of communication that allow for an easy way to resolve conflicts before they arise.

The house itself is a large four bedroom, two bath house.  The basement is in various sections, but the community is working to finish off a large section of the basement to provide another three bedroom, one and a half bath living space.  There is also a separate part of the basement that serves as the community workshop with a full compliment of tools.

When the house was purchased in 2017 the lot was essentially a bare weedy space.  Since that time, a large number of fruiting and nut producing trees and bushes have been planted.  Gardens are currently being built with an irrigation system coming soon.  After the basement living space is finished off, the community will be building a semi-subterranean, earth-sheltered, passive solar, four-season greenhouse.  When that is done we'll move onward with more projects to increase the energy-efficiency and sustainability of the community. 
 Lots of projects to turn this community into the permaculture paradise it will one day be.  Involvement in these projects is not required to be a community member.</description>

That community is a critically important value in our lives, particularly as we contemplate the aging process
That envrionmental sustainability should guide all of us in our decisions about how to design the ideal space in which to live
That the practice of coming together to design and build a co-housing community is an endeavor worthy of our skills and energies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/baltimore-senior-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/baltimore-senior-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This will be the first cohousing community in the Baltimore area. We welcome folks of different races, religions, gender identification or sexual preference, or income level. We do identify as a Senior community, and although we are prepared to be flexible about age under a variety of circumstances, prospective members should understand that our mission is primarily focused on the needs of seniors.</description>

intelligence within all living being.  We care for our body, our planet ,all species that are alive and we do our 
part to be the example of walking in peace and creating a better healthier world. We stand with awareness and walk 
together as equals. We invite all who are called to remember, know, feel, be, create, share and thrive in our highest 
expression of joy and abundance. We ask that we all bring forth our uniqueness with our gifts, wisdom, experience to 
create this master peace reality. We provide space for healing and creative expression and we encourage experiences 
that support loving relationships, regenerative living, gift economics, 
health and well being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/lotus-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/lotus-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are still in the process of creating the community. 

If you could do anything and monetary system was not involved What would you do? to take care of needs, wants? 

What excites you ?What turns you on ? What are you passionate about ? What motivates, inspires and empowers you ? 

What gifts, wisdom ,experience, skills would you love to share with the world? 



I am we are envisioning a world where we all thrive in abundance. I have spent the last 14 years connecting with others and started many groups all starting with conscious conversation on topics similar to these. 
I am now one of the new co-operating co-owner-member of Lotus Mountain Retreat located in Bolton Valley, Vermont . 
This project is one of a kind. Our intention and Vision here @ Lotus is to be a model for Ubuntu living . 
What does this mean ? For our vision to be shared many videos have been made to inform, empower and inspire others to remember, know, feel, be, create, share, thrive ! 
Here is a video @ https://youtu.be/kM6XjO-pD_Q

We are co-creating a blueprint for a new social structure, a new system, a new reality, without the need for any violence, opposition, resistance, or conflict or the monetary system. All the socio-economic structures of our individual countries have failed us dramatically. It is time to collaborate together to create a better model so that all living beings live in harmony with all living beings. 
Every day we witness a continued assault on our people and the world around us, orchestrated by the global elite who have taken control, of every aspect of our existence. Every single one of us, rich or poor, is born into life-long slavery and bondage from which there is no escape under the current system. Most of us know that the system we are born into does not serve humanity, but very few of us know what to do to change it.

We can no longer sit idly, watching the destruction of our people, our communities, our countries, and our human potential, by greedy corporations supported by governments with no remorse for their actions, or accountability to the people they are supposed to serve. We can no longer sit silently, hoping that someone will do something to stop this assault on our liberties and future prosperity. It has fallen on the shoulders of the common people, to unite and create a new way...a new system...a future filled with abundance and prosperity for ourselves and our children. We are creating a totally new system free from economic slavery... where we turn competition into collaboration... a new social structure where we all benefit from our collective efforts and individual talents... a new world where people are put before profits, and the resources &amp;amp; materials are used to enrich all our lives. 

We Would you like to meet with others who are interested in taking our life , our experience, our consensus reality to another level ?





We look Forward to connecting with you ! 

Namaste, In lakech, ala kin.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23139&quot;&gt;God is true love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Serve God continuously&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/god-is-true-love/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/god-is-true-love/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hello to everyone interested in true love and wisdom that comes only from God. We are a spiritual community that follows the true translation of the bible. We don't have any religion, we just follow the right path that God wants for His creatures. We believe in predestination  and universal salvation. We wait for the coming of God and His right judgment. Until that time we live a simple life in nature, doing what God intends for us to do, farming and eating what we are producing. We don't have insurance of any kind, because we believe that only God is our insurance in everything. We don't need any insurance from people. Our future is in the hands of God, like bible says. It's a sin and a big blasphemy to God to say that we believe in Him but we go to men and ask from them insurance for the future. In consequence we don't work for men because the insurance is obligatory. We work our land given to us by God. He is merciful with us and gives us rain and we have what to eat. In this country the insurance for house is not obligatory, and the taxes for land and house are still low. This area where we live is peaceful because God protects us. It is written that if we serve Him we will have everything we need in order to survive here and be happy. I suppose many have such a dream and we can say it is possible, but only with God. We expect to hear from brothers and sisters interested in this way of living. You are welcome.</description>

Elphinstone by practicing non-violent civil disobedience, living naturally in a more sustainable, non earth-harming way, and offer a place for others to do the same. Our goal is to change the perspectives in our current society to a new, more balanced ideology where all life is respected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/elphinstone-rainbow-warriors/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/elphinstone-rainbow-warriors/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This camp was formed as a project to protect the old growth forests on the Sunshine Coast that surround Mt. Elphinstone. We are looking for members to join and assist in building the capacity of our camp this summer. Various projects we'd like to implement this summer are: planting a permaculture food forest, building non-permanent structures like tiny homes or platforms for camping, beautifying the camp as well as general maintenance tasks. Join our cause and bring forward any skills you have to offer.

The group need help with various activities around the camp this summer (see below) but most importantly we are looking for individuals to volunteer their time to help us stop the next cutting block proposed for early September 2018. 

Help needed this summer:
- Teaching permaculture and food forest growing techniques, as well as helping with design
- Planting/sewing seed to provide the group with food
- Cooking meals for the group
- Teaching or sharing experiences with laws/regulations surrounding protesting, blockades and activism
- Cleaning and general camp maintenance tasks
- Building temporary structures and/or tiny homes
- Creating banners and signage that are aesthetically pleasing

Accommodation at the moment is mostly camping. We have tarps to create dry areas to camp. There are a couple simple structures built for individuals to sleep in. We are hoping to have volunteers help us build more structures for the area. Food is provided.

At a time where our earth is being polluted and our natural resources destroyed, the group are gathering individuals of all backgrounds to join forces and protect what is left of Mother nature. 

There are some guidelines to be aware of before joining our group:
  Be kind
  Be respectful 
  Clean up after yourself
  Don't bring anything for the camp without asking first
  No violence or abusive behavior 

The culture of the forest protection group revolves around working together as a community and not being afraid to rejoin nature and live on the land. When volunteering at the camp you will learn how to live a simple lifestyle in the forest, growing your own food, the importance of going back to the wild and connecting with nature directly as well as our approach to activism in terms of stopping proposed logging cut blocks.</description>

There is no water on the land, we have to go to sierra blanca to get it. We have a few five gallon containers we fill every few days. We have a composting toilet, a propane travel stove, a solar oven, and a fire pit. We plan to get solar panels for electric. Its a great location for solar power or wind. We are locatd in a beautiful mountain view and are 13 miles from the mexican border. Plan to have a small green house. Want to eventually have a water source in the future. We dont want to do this alone. We are looking for people who want to live eco-friendly. We hope to find people to add ideas and help us build and grow. We dont want to share income, we just want to have people who would like to share our land and have their own dwellings and share the fruit from the land. Would eventually like to have bee boxes for honey. Plan to build cobb houses when we have a vehicle large enough for a 300 gallon water container. We hust want to share our land with other like minded people. We are very friendly and down to earth people. We are accepting and non-judgmental. We are more spiritual than religious. Sean and i are married with no children, two fixed male black cats, four zebra finches, and we live in a shed on land. We are late 20s early 30s.we hope to have some goats and chickens in the future.</description>

We are working together as a pseudo-family to evolve our own interpersonal skills and co-create more healthier, ecologically-rooted ways of living. We value honesty, accountability, mutualism, connection to the earth, non-consumerism, creativity, fun, alternative economics, and simplicity. Other goals include being a space that is empowering, a source for our own personal development and a reprieve from larger structural oppression, a resource for mutual aid, a life close to the land, a place lush with plants and food with supportive, generous residents to share burdens and multiply joys. 

Our community is on a third acre of land with 4 units, set up as private rooms and shared-use common areas outside the houses and in the kitchen, baths and living rooms within the houses. There is also a garden space, bicycle space, tools and multi-purpose workshop, a deck, fire pit, entertaining space, outdoor kitchen, float tank, outdoor shower (coming soon) plus other leisure and sustainability features. 

We, like many worldwide, are trying to figure out how to have different relationships with each other and the world. We sense the urgency and couldn’t wait any longer to start working towards living the dream!

Some other values current members hold and want to embody and see in other members and are community are:

Courtesy and respect of others
Flexibility
Honesty
Accountability and responsibility
Mutual Aid/Collectivism
Ecologically-conscious, connected and healthy living
Simplicity/Non-consumerism/DIY or creation/crafting

green buildings with small carbon footprints, sustainability, shared resources, emphasis on alternative transportation and 
ecological land use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/prairie-hill-iowa-city-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/prairie-hill-iowa-city-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Prairie Hill Cohousing/ Iowa City Cohousing is a community of 36 green homes on an 8-acre site within a mile of the University of Iowa and downtown Iowa City, Iowa. The first members moved into their homes, and the Common House, including four studio apartments, has been completed in May 2018.  About half the homes have been spoken for, and we welcome new members of all ages.  We are especially interested in welcoming families with school-age children.

Half of our site will be devoted to gardens, orchards and prairie. We will manage our property according to permaculture principles with small kitchen gardens near the homes and larger vegetable gardens and fruit trees clustered some distance from the homes.  We are committed to managing stormwater on our land and have built a bioswale and detention basin to hold water on our site to keep it out of the city storm sewer which leads ultimately to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.

The Prairie Hill homes range in size from 515-square foot studio apartments to 1600-square foot two-story, four-bedroom duplexes.  Other home sizes are 800-, 950-, and 1200 square feet with one or two bedrooms. The buildings are all-electric and super-insulated, and they have been sited to accommodate solar panels on their roofs.  (Our architect jokes that they can be heated with a hair dryer.) Every home has at least one bathroom, a kitchen and connections for laundry appliances.

The Common House has a large community kitchen and dining room for regular shared meals, a coffee nook, small living room, activity room, kids’ room, two guest rooms, and a laundry. An elevator and wheelchair accessible bathrooms, and close-in handicapped parking make the Common House accessible to people with mobility limitations. Many of the homes are visitable or livable by people who use wheelchairs.

Iowa City is a cosmopolitan community of 70,000 highly rated on many lists of livable communities. It is within comfortable driving distance of Chicago, Minneapolis, Omaha, and St Louis and just 20 miles from a regional airport serving several major airlines. As home to the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop and International Writing Program, independent bookstores, and many notable writers and poets, Iowa City was the first UNESCO City of Literature in the United States.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23145&quot;&gt;Kadagaya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to evaluate and develop the immediate implementation of a resource-based economy within the current economic and social system, through a transition project involving the development of a pilot community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kadagaya/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kadagaya/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Kadagaya is a community focusing on achieving human and social development through the implementation of a resource-based economy (RBE). Our first pilot project is based in Junin, Peru, where we are constructing an experimental village to evaluate the concepts of RBE. We are aiming to achieve self-sufficiency, reduce human labour and increase quality of life through the development of advanced (mostly open-source) technologies and increasing the consciousness of the community. The supporting systems (e.g. energy, water, agriculture, health, and education) are being holistically designed to increase efficiency and reliability while promoting the consciousness of the interdependency of all systems. Accessibility of knowledge is fundamental to the development of an RBE society and hence all developments from Kadagaya will be freely available to anyone who is interested. We are not a company, an NGO, a charity or a religious group. Neither are we a hippie commune or meditation/yoga retreat. We are simply a group of individuals who want to explore an alternate system of living and find solutions for some of the problems of the current society, while living in a way that is consistent with our ideals.

We currently have three adult members (plus our families) and are looking to expand up to about 40 people.</description>

Our focus is on Tiny Houses, Intentional Communities, including models such as Ecovillages, Cohousing / Housing Cooperatives, and the larger cooperative movement, including all kinds of cooperative and collective organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/osagewood-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/osagewood-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are located in Stella, Oklahoma — between Oklahoma City, Norman and Shawnee, in the Greater OKC Metro Area. Also conveniently located between Shawnee Twin Lakes, Lake Thunderbird, Wes Watkins Lake and Stanley Draper Lake to our west.  Our land is sited on 10-15 acres of gentle slopes among the natural beauty of a forest garden filled with abundant wildlife. Land is currently held in a private trust (we own title to the property), and will be made available to the forming community (or individual members) as needed.

Osagewood is forming as an ecologically sustainable and socially-responsible community of Tiny Houses. It will be a community of creative, open-minded individuals working together to co-create in an open egalitarian forum, and reaching decisions by consensus.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23148&quot;&gt;Prairie Song Farms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Holistic Goal - Vision and Mission revised and updated Spring 2013
The holistic goal contains four primary sections: Statement of Purpose, Quality of Life, Forms of Production, and Future Resource Base. Each section builds on the next, and descriptions of each section are given briefly next to each heading title.

Statement of Purpose - The overarching mission
    To build a resilient community that provides opportunities for people to learn how to live in harmony with each other and the cosmos.

“Quality of Life, forms of production, and future resource base goals have to be combined into one comprehensive, holistic goal. Otherwise decisions could be made in support of one aspect, while damaging another.” from Holistic Management

Quality of Life - A description of how we want our life to be, in the context of the farm, based on what we most value
    Life at the farm is latent with an underlying peace and fosters harmony in diversity. We live together honestly, passionately, and creatively in community. Our work is inspired by our individual passions, yet contributes toward a shared purpose. 

We want to develop an infrastructure and landscape that generates long-term food self-sufficiency, energy and water independence, and economic abundance; this involves commitment to necessary systems of organization to maintain what is developed, revising systems as needed to respond to changing conditions and new information. We want to share the lessons and opportunities from the farm to the community of Fairfield and beyond. And we want to help build a place where future generations can grow up naturally, comfortably and without fear.

Forms of Production - What we have to produce to fulfill the purpose of Prairie Song Farms and create the qualities of life that we desire
Community celebrations and activities that foster community spirit
An environment that is open to art, music, dancing, social gatherings, and other aspects of life that generally promote richness, creativity and fun
Comfortable, functional, and energy efficient dwellings
Renewable energy for electrical needs, and load calculations for existing structures
Plants for food and medicine, and care taking guidelines to support their growth and use
Food processing and storage space
Systems of organization that support orderliness and maintenance of community spaces and equipment
Community kitchen use
Living room and porch use
Tools use
Trash and recycling protocol
Greenhouse use
Methods of communication to help us harmonize our activities, including systems of accountability for project planning/implementation/maintenance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/prairie-song-farms/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/prairie-song-farms/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Where We Started
 
The idea of Prairie Song Farms is that Sustainable Living Students from the University can come to apply on site “hands-on” knowledge that they learn in the classroom, while at the same time establishing a perennial, self supporting system of energy, infrastructure, polyculture, education, and community.
 
When we first began in 2009 we planted a garden, and began making the old farm home liveable. That spring and summer consisted of painting, re-flooring, putting in a septic system, installing a sump-pump in the floor of the basement in the farmhouse, planting trees, sealing the roof of the farmhouse, fixing the gutters, cleaning out the attic and sealing off the front porch to make the place livable, along with getting to know the land with everything we did.
 
In the Fall of 2010 we had an incredible momentum returning to Prairie Song Farm from California in a ‘69 International school bus with seven college students. We kept the momentum going by the building of a StrawBale cottage inspired and funded by our newest member of the team, Jeremiah. We built the cottage in a month, and simultaneously started on the renovation of the south barn/storage shed which is now a home with attached greenhouse and water catchment unit.

The 2012-2013 year saw a changing scene at the farm, with the 2010 crew graduating and leaving the farm, and a new group gradually emerging. Some of the babies left, some new babies moved in. In the spring of 2013 a permaculture design plan was made by James for his senior project, and Rick Valley -an experienced permaculturist from Oregon- came for a 2 days to consult the farm on its permaculture design and long-term vision. The farm also got a partial grant to build a greenhouse. The greenhouse is now up - completed over the summer 2013, and more activity will ensue based on the people at the farm from here on out. The permaculture design plan is in a binder at the farm in hard copy, as well as online shared with the group on google drive.

In December 2013 we experienced a fire in the top floor of the farmhouse.Quick thinking by Victor Orne and help from all members (we were having a farm meeting downstairs when the fire started) plus quick response from the Fairfield Fire Department saved the building. The fire was the impetus to do the long-considered renovations to the old place. 

The entire top story was removed and replaced with a Victor Orne designed and implemented simpler and taller roof. The building’s electrical system was upgraded, heating vents were reconfigured and improved, and the outside foundation was insulated. As of 2015, a new metal roof is in place, the South steps have been rebuilt, foam insulation has been added, the West porch is now a heated bedroom, the East deck has been re-roofed, drywall and painting are done. It’s a much more expansive interior on both floors.

In October 2013 Jeffrey &amp;amp; Linda began building their future home out in the Northwest hay field. Fall, 2017 the house is now complete.

June 2014. Several PSF members graduated and launched themselves into the world. We miss them dearly and look forward to their return visits.natives to meet our water, food, shelter, and energy needs. Ultimately propelling the shift of the paradigm of scarcity into one of absolute abundance.”</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23149&quot;&gt;Hearth Howl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We want to live with people we love who share our practices of liberation - holistic healing, teaching and learning.

We embrace uniquely beautiful self-identities, whether acquired by nature or nurture, chosen by your best self, or some chaotic combination.  There is wisdom shared with pack in where we have been, and where we choose to go.

We believe in honoring our ancestors, shaking collective and familial skeletons out of their closets, and preparing the next generations by co-parenting feral, conscious children.

We rejoice in eating well-raised meat, bow in thankful joy for the fungus, and bend our gratitude for wheat.  We strive to tread lightly and joyfully on this earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/hearth-howl/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/hearth-howl/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are forming a bold community. We unapologetically pursue healing for ourselves, our neighbors, and the world. The community will center on a holistic healing practice, deep bonds of intimacy and support between members, and continual learning and growth.

The holistic healing practice will operate as a business (business plan in development) and be served by our deep interrelationships as we think and work with clients together.

Deep interrelationships will include polyamory, wildly consensual kink, and the sort of close friendships where we talk about everything. We believe in pack: People with whom we share deep, intuitive connection, easy laughter, and sustainable growth.  

Witchy warrior-queens, polyamorous high priestesses and knights errant are welcome and will be well-fed. Spirit of wolf or dragon? All the better.

We already live a fantasy, and we’re growing our fantasy into the world. If what we describe touches on things close to your heart, reach out.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23150&quot;&gt;Śiva Ashram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; - Provide a quiet space away from busy modern life to allow for spiritual unfoldment. 
- To develop a strong spiritual center for Saivism in eastern canada where it is possible tolive the most traditional monastic/ashram lifestyle possible. 
- To make the teachings of Saiva Siddhantha available to those it might benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/siva-ashram/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/siva-ashram/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Śiva Ashram is made up of a group of yoga enthusiasts living in the woods sharing daily spiritual practices and karma yoga / work in the accommodation business that sustains our community. 

Our site include a house with 3 rooms, two tiny houses fitting two people each and a trailer home. We share common areas of the house (kitchen, dining, living room and meditation room) outdoor jacuzzi.

We focus on living a contemplative lifestyle with simple tasks and clearly defined time blocks to allow time for contemplation and meditation throughout the day. Our group's spiritual unfoldment is stimulated and guided by hindu philosophy, meditation, devotional practices, hatha yoga, scripture study, vedic chanting and mantra singing. 

Religious/philosophical lineage :
Śiva stands for Shiva, which refers to the God most would otherwise call &quot;the universe&quot;, which to us is omnipresent love and transcendent reality. We follow and study Saiva Siddhantha which is a traditional mystical branch of hinduism from south india and northern Sri Lanka that sees Śiva as the ultimate God. We believe all souls are divine, and we strive to see God in all and everything as well as within ourselves. We also believe that one of life's most important goal is the realization of the self God within us, self-realisation, the experience of parasiva and Saiva Siddhantha provides us with many tools, practices and lessons on this inner journey. We also believe in reincarnation, karma and dharma and study these topics in depth. Hinduism being very inclusive, we are open to people coming from any path as long as they are curious enough to experiment this philosophy with us for a while to see if it might fit them or not. 

We finance our lifestyle through the maintenance and development of an accommodation business we developped on our 34 acre wooden land. 
So far, we have installed 4 different cabins that we rent (tipi, 2 bubble to sleep under the stars and tree house). We are presently building a hobbit house and will soon build s site for a second bubble for clients to sleep under the stars in the fall.</description>

    To willingly contribute my time, efforts and financial resources toward making these values possible 

In the wider community we hold as values:
    To be an inspiration to others
    To improve our world by living lightly and sustainably on the planet

We are a partnership of two people living a wonderful low-tech, agrarian life on 5 bountiful rural acres in central Idaho near Nez Perce territory (monogamy is not a necessity for living in our community). Currently our little rural community consists of 2 members, but we would love to grow. This region if Idaho has an abundant climate and growing season. We are able to plant, grow and harvest and catch a wide variety of food year round. We are seeking others who share our lifestyle. Families welcome, children welcome, non-monogamous individuals welcome. We seek community who follow the ideas of Ubuntu Contributionism and Native ways of living. We celebrate the human form and mind in their totality. We do this by practicing nutrition and nudity for example. Our community respects all gender identities. We practice art, music, singing, dance, woodcraft, sewing arts, and are open to new art forms as well. We envision having a community center being utilized for neighborhood and community events. We are open to ideas, of course! We would love to co-create some contra-dancing, folk music jams, sings, community cooking and seed sharing.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23159&quot;&gt;Natural Law Permagora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Truth, Love, and Freedom are the core of our values. We focus on living in harmony with the Laws of Nature on any and every level we can, from nonviolence in our actions as well as our communication, our diet, food and medicine, relationship with the earth, etc. We value balance, sacred feminine and sacred masculine; yin and yang, mercy and severity; to do no harm but take no sh1t. We respect everyone as individuals on their journey, all growing at our own pace, with the common goal that we are growing to become the best versions of ourselves that we can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/natural-law-permagora/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/natural-law-permagora/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hello, beautiful souls.  My partner and I and our two cats have been living in an intentional community realizing we have a vision for something more, and are planing and ready to grow and co-create intentional community eith you.  We have come to find that living in community is an essential part of life, as is nonviolence on all levels. My partner has carpentry and construction skills and works with metal. I have experience with permaculture, facilitation and interpersonal skills.  We are looking for a location as well as like-minded indoviduals who value freedom and non-violence. We want a place where we can meet our needs of pursuing our ikigai, which for both of us includes subverting the system and building a new way of living that is voluntary, consent based, and includes the love of truth and freedom, recognizing and seeking to live in harmony with the Laws of Nature. More specifically for my partner it is through his blacksmithing, metal art, and painting,  and for me it is through direct contact with nature via witchcraft, permaculture, and tools to know thyself such as tarot, palmistry, psychology, nvc, self exploration, chanting, and knowledge sharing.  Once a location is found we may live in tents at first while finding a good fit and can later build. We are from Oregon and thrive in the pnw green forest environment but are open to traveling for the right fit. I'm putting this out there so if anyone would like to get to know us please reach out. Thank you.</description>

      <name>Victoria Unschooling Project</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23160&quot;&gt;Victoria Unschooling Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Victoria Unschooling Project is a community of unschooling families living outside of Victoria BC, Canada. We're pro-vaccination, screen-positive, body-positive, LGBT-positive, and pro-childrens’ rights. Our primary motivation is to create a childrens’ paradise, in which our kids can play freely with each other and enjoy their childhoods, and where adults united in a shared belief of peaceful parenting can make friends and build community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/victoria-unschooling-project/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/victoria-unschooling-project/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Unschooling families with school-aged children and younger are warmly invited to join a new intentional community close to Victoria, on Vancouver Island, BC. We’re looking at places 20 minutes' driving distance to downtown Victoria, and invite unschooling families to join in and help steer the project. We'll build houses on the land (or rent or buy nearby), and have a main building on the land to provide a communal space for an unschool and a community kitchen, and extra units on the land could be used to host prospective community members, worldschoolers, and other guests.

We currently run a weekly unschooling meet-up in Beacon Hill Park every Wednesday, and an annual unschooling family camping trip every June in Goldstream provincial park.  Email us, or check out our Facebook for details.

What we are:

We're people who believe that community is good for humans, and that kids needs space and time to play with other kids.  We buy our food from shops, travel and go to restaurants, enjoy films and TV and games.  No cult here, no eco-hippie ideals about growing everything we eat, we're not trying to disappear from society or prepare for the apocalypse.  We're just a small co-housing of friends communally raising our free-range kids together.

We are unschoolers. We believe that children will flourish if given space to pursue their own interests in their own ways, and we will commit to creating a space in which they can be free to play, explore and learn at their own pace.

We are body-positive. We believe that children (and adults) can be trusted to choose for themselves what to do with their bodies: what to eat, when to sleep, how to exercise, and so on. While individual families may make their own agreements regarding food, meals, and bedtimes, we do not police the choices of other children and adults. We acknowledge that some people are disabled; we acknowledge that some people are fat; we acknowledge that all states of the body are morally neutral. In short: we don’t police kids’ eating, we don’t fat-shame people, and we don’t go around telling people sugar causes cancer.

We are screen-positive. We believe that children (and adults) can be trusted to choose for themselves what to do with their time, and moderate their own hobbies, interests, and learning methods. While individual families may have their own agreements regarding screen usage, we will not be asking other adults to police our own kids’ screen use timings.  And high speed Internet for all!

We strive to be interesting, and interested. Our wishlists for learning and hobby spaces on the land include: a veg patch, a craft and making space, a music studio, a quiet library space, and a den for video gaming. We will also take part in the local unschooling and homeschooling community: we will organise outings to museums, farms, aquariums, forests, makerspaces, and other places of interest and learning.

What we are not: 

We're not big on drug and alcohol use, but not huge haters either. We believe kids shouldn't have to deal with drunk/high jerks, and if getting wasted/high several times a month is your idea of fun, then we probably won't get along.  

We are not an eco-commune. We will not be growing significant quantities of our own food, nor will we be setting up any kind of community farm. The main reason for this is because we have lives, and hobbies, and we want to spend time with our children, and buying food from a store gives us time to do those things.   Also our children roam free about the land and large quantities of land given over to crops, fenced off as inaccessible, or dangerous farming equipment on the land will all hinder this. If it is important to you to grow a significant quantity of your own food, or to have access to large-scale industrial farming equipment, this may not be the community for you.

We are not a sustainability-focused commune. While recycling is lovely, we acknowledge that 80% of pollution comes from industrial waste, and we strive to keep our own sustainability interests small-scale and unstressful. There will be meat-eating, use of disposable diapers, and imperfect recycling practices going on in the community. If you’re looking to absolutely minimise your carbon footprint, this may not be the commune for you.

We are not a vegan commune. We expect families to take responsibility for their food needs in their independent housing units, and what families choose to eat is their concern. We will be running a large community dinner a couple of times a week, and this will not be vegan by default (we hope, instead, that there will be several options.)  If it is important to you that other members of your community are vegan, this may not be the commune for you.

The Victoria Unschooling Project is vaccination-positive and science-positive; this is not negotiable; if your family are anti- vaccination, there is no place for you here.

We are not going to be living on a building site.  If you can construct your own tiny house in a couple of weeks, go for it.  If not, get a professional to do it.  There will be no rusting automobiles on blocks, no half-constructed buildings, no mud pits where a house may someday be built.

We are not trying to live money-free.  We have jobs, either working in Victoria or working online.  We want to be able to collectively invest in playgrounds and fun stuff for our kids, enjoy good food, and travel.  If you're broke and have no interest in work, or you want to live a cashless existence, then our bourgeois values will likely leave you unhappy.</description>

      <name>Stage-One Tulum</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23161&quot;&gt;Stage-One Tulum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We put our heart into raising life from the ashes of another's past. We put our backs into making the experience as holistic and real as possible. We put our hope in other people's love for Tulum and the Future. We invite you to come and grow with us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/stage-one-tulum/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/stage-one-tulum/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Birth of the Stage-One Concept

With long-term hopes of becoming a 200 unit mixed lodging  that offers activities and is supported by its own autonomous village comprised of resident and non-resident members; 

The initial build out zone is tucked 330 meters west of the federal highway near the front of the land parcel. The land offers 230 acres of lush flora and active fauna with a rough and varied geography including a small wetland area and an unimproved cenote at the base of a large cave mouth near the back of the property. The land stands largely unexplored.The Stage-one concept is located on a family owned parcel of land at the southern border of Tulum County, Quintana Roo Mexico.

The land was acquired over 18 years ago along with a slither of beach land and other jungle lots. Very different market conditions existed then than what exist today. Lands in the Tulum area at that time were mostly “ejido property” that couldn't be owned outright and did not guarantee that the property could ever be “owned” as most people would consider property ownership.

None of these obstacles ever deterred the man who risked aggressively to obtain and maintain possession of the lands. We call him The Founder as that's what he is. He essentially founded every project that will ever be executed on the lands that he fought for and labored on for a decade.

The Founder went right to work; rustling up a truck and three able hands and immediately began creating Cabanas La Zebra. Within two years he had raised  4 cabins and Small Kitchen Palapa out of jungle lumber and grass for the roofs. The road then was so bad from Tulum to sian ka an that potholes 8 meters in diameter and 70cm deep would form in rainy season to drown vehicles like our little red Volkswagen bug and many others. We would have to wade in and force it out to a dryer patch of road and let the thing set for a while to dry. Days were filled with the delays of everyday paradise and seclusion.

A few years after taking on partners in 2003, The Founder liquidated his share in La Zebra and other Hotel Zone Lands. From that point he became more and more focused on creating a network of ecological communal villages in the jungles near Tulum, Oaxaca and Calakmul.

By 2008 he had developed a manual, build-out plans, created a board of directors and had reclaimed over 1300 tons of structural and architectural materials from historical demolitions in the US.  He was preparing to import the material into Mexico for use in the construction of his hallmark undertaking that he rightly named “The Preserved Life Project.” While gearing up for the importation process, the founder established a small homestead on the far west border of some jungle land behind Tulum that consisted of two palapas and a shower tower with a hand dug well.

One week after completing homestead #1, The Founder died tragically in an automobile accident while visiting the material holding yard in the US. Life has a way of throwing us curve balls when we think we have reached a season of perpetual assent. The Founder's life had become ashes; family and friends were left uncomforted and confused, Homestead #1  was lost in the woods along with the founder's dreams.

Only 4 months after the tragedy, news came over the wire that the lands had reached a middle-way status in their legal battle to a point where the federal government recognized that the property had the possibility of ownership or the issuance of a formal title deed. An important milestone had been reached but the task was far from finished.

In 2015 after 17 years of legal struggle and just under a million dollars, the lands were issued their title deed with respective registrations and became legal, marketable property. Land Tax Valuations of titled land located in the southern most point of Mexico's most important tourism zone provided the successors with a new set of actions to decide on and undertake. The feeling of a massive victory to end a battle that raged for nearly two decades was over in an instant. WE had a choice:

1.Sell the land to the owner of the rest of the land in our vicinity, recover expenses and close the chapter.
2. Make the land meet critical mass so that it can sustain compliance and maintenance cost without additional external injections. We do this by sharing the property with other people.

After a careful consideration of the task and adventure at hand, we chose both! So stage-One Camping was born in late 2016, we started cutting our way into the thick jungle from the highway until we made it to the first hill. We created our work camp there and slowly progressed to the initial build-out area. The Founder's Homestead #1 was located in January 2017 and the site is now known as “The Founder's Ruins.'</description>

1) To provide nutrient-dense, organic, ethical food to the cooperatively minded of the mid/lower Hudson valley and the greater NYC area.
2) To provide opportunities for retreat, recreation, connection, and education in transformative living skills like permaculture, regenerative farming, cooperative living, personal development, social justice and political activism, and more.
3) To provide a home, a community, and livelihood to those drawn by this vision and the values embodied within it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/solidarity-farm-at-maybrook-lodge/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/solidarity-farm-at-maybrook-lodge/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a new community forming in Kerhonkson NY based at an old Catskills retreat center about 2hrs driving from NYC.   There is a good foundation starting with a democratic ownership structure, 20+ bedrooms, 15acs of land, and connections to NYC community.  We want this to be a home for fellow radicals who also feel that cooperation, regenerative ecological relationships, social justice, and more are the essential values of our time, and (we hope!) the foundations of a society that can adress the challenges of climate change with some hope of &quot;success&quot; 

https://www.instagram.com/solidarityfarmny/
https://www.facebook.com/SolidarityFarmatMaybrook/

 The location is a former Catskills retreat in Kerhonkson NY in the rich Rondout Valley. (After renovation) there will be 20+ bedrooms, abundant community spaces, artist and craft workspaces, commercial kitchen and sustainable food education space, big dance hall and performance space and more!

Cooperative economic opportunities– there are various enterprises possible on the land

We are getting the farm business started by selling whole-farm shares to other intentional communities and coops in NYC. We are initially offering community-sized CSA shares: a bulk delivery of  veggies/eggs/meat delivered each week to the respective community/coop house.  

Other business ventures include farmstays, retreats, workshops, music and performance events, green building, artisan products and much more. 

Creative and cooperative/entrepreneurial types encouraged to check us out! Visitors always welcome.

Ganas, an intentional community in Staten Island with 70 members will be an “anchor” customer.  One of the side benefits of the project is a place to stay in a community in NYC on days off, delivery days, etc. and be connected to a growing network of intentional community in NYC and beyond!

Likewise, housing insecurity can increase the risk of being targeted by policing and incarceration, can negatively affect eligibility for employment, and can impact a community’s stability and resiliency.

We envision a resilient network of cooperatives, built on self-determination and mutual aid, that are run by and for low-income and marginalized residents. We envision thriving communities: where people have their needs met, have access to support and services, and where members can build relationships to work together on neighborhood issues and social justice issues that affect the Twin Cities area as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/mutual-aid-twin-cities-housing-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/mutual-aid-twin-cities-housing-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;MATCH Co-op provides sustainable and accessible housing for low-income people, particularly individuals from marginalized communities; empowers people to run autonomous residences; expands accessible cooperative housing in the Twin Cities; and creates a basis for thriving communities.</description>

We have identified land in town and have been meeting since February 2018 to discuss our shared values and how they will manifest in our community. Our leaders have prior cohousing experience as well as extensive experience in house restoration. We are seeking members who want deep friendship with their neighbors, want to live lightly on the earth, and want to be an asset to their neighborhood. This will be a multigenerational community of 10-30 households. We are considering homes in the form of duplexes constructed with straw bales. The Tri-Cities is a vibrant community in the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains. Balsamroot blossoms in the spring.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23166&quot;&gt;Baynton Community House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; See above... we're working on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/baynton-community-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/baynton-community-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We live in a neighborhood of Philadelphia called Germantown that is on the outskirts of the city, but still in city limits. So we have denser housing and many businesses, but also a lot of green space. One of the most beautiful parks, the Wissahickon is just a mile or two away. Our house is a large mansion from the 1860s. Some of us have lived here for as many as 4-5 years, but we are only recently beginning to have more formal conversation about what this community living is all about! So the intentionality has been evolving and is just getting to a place of being more officially established. We've had a few of those meetings so far and will likely be continuing that process over the next few months. (as of July 2018)

There are 8 of us living here, 3 cats, and 1 dog. Our age range is 27-48. 

Currently, we have a grocery and dinner share, where we combine and split all of our grocery purchases and we each cook for the house one meal a week. We share responsibilities of home upkeep and have monthly house meetings. We grow food at a local farm and do working member hours for a discount at our local food co-op. We interact often with our neighbors who are of varying degrees of communal living as well. We host a weekly game night, solstice and equinox gatherings, communication and meditation workshops, and we have a bit of a village vibe with a bread baker, kombucha maker, and public music events at the local garden. We also have an optional car share and are exploring other communal ownership possibilities. 

Enough about us, now how bout you… 
- We’re seeking community-minded people with experience and/or strong desire to live communally. 
- Please be willing to put some roots down with us and see us more as family than roommates. 
- Rooms vary from $250-$450/month and we split utilities that average $75/month. 
- A security deposit of one month’s rent is required, and 2 month’s notice is required if/when you move out. 

We have a room opening up for August or September 2018.</description>

(Southeast Texas) Djedi Institute and Academy acknowledges the spirit world as numerous cutting edge schools of science are PROVING the existence of the things that our five senses cannot perceive and explores the religious practices that allow one to obtain utilization of The Force.



I believe strongly in the possibility that The Force in Star Wars is The Source.

Skills that I foresee being taught are foraging, bow making, self-sustenance gardening, meditation, prayer life, historical accounts of fasting and prayer achieving miraculous results, primitive construction technologies, permaculture, holistic living and more.


Currently, there are opportunities for the right individuals, investors and Djedhi masters to barter physical labour for free rent and tuition into the Jedi Academy and institute or to become co-founders and instructors.  To qualify you must be able to provide your own shelter, essentials and sustenance for a free place to camp and learn and/or teach.  To qualify for this scholarship you must write a letter describing yourself, your goals and aspirations in detail as well as your legitimate birth location, birth time and date of birth.  Some of the laborous activities may include but are not limited to, road maintenance, trail maintenance, garden maintenance, bottle wall construction, Ewok village construction and Yoda hut construction.  

If you do not put significant effort into your initial correspondence you will not be eligible for the scholarship opportunity.  If you do take the time to honestly represent yourself and your intentions you likely then be asked to elaborate on some points and then further questioning.  We are looking for the right people, qualified individuals because we have learned the hard way about all sorts of people who are not worth sharing our lives with.</description>

      <name>SoL - Space of Love Village – a multigenerational homesteading community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23169&quot;&gt;SoL - Space of Love Village – a multigenerational homesteading community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Creating the best conditions for healthy living, creative work and raising children. A multi-generational homesteading neighborhood community base on the common ground of gardening, natural child rearing and including elderly people into the communal live again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sol-space-of-love-village-a-multigenerational-homesteading-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sol-space-of-love-village-a-multigenerational-homesteading-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Inspired by the Space of Love/Kin’s Domain Movement around the world we set out to find this fertile ground to create our own Space of Love. Eventually we made our home on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. Here we’ve found everything we were looking for to live an intentional life on the land &amp;amp; raising children in a natural way – pristine landscapes, mild climate, rugged coastline along the wild and lonesome ocean, deep green forests and clear streams, rivers, ponds and lakes, affordable land, natural abundance and bounty as seldom seen before and last but not least friendly and ever helpful local people. 

“Cape Breton Island – Your heart will never leave” – this is what they say, and oh how true they are… 

More than 3 years now we grow, work, perfect, admire &amp;amp; love our chosen homeland. We grow a big vegetable garden, a potato patch, built a greenhouse and a root cellar and planted an orchard. Our living fence is tiny yet growing. We live in a small but cozy and light home and over time, we are looking to improve the house to become an even more self-sufficient unit. We are not complete off-grid but strive to become so in the near future. Our kids are 1 and 6 year(s) old. We homeschool/unschool the older and are overall into a very natural parenting approach/natural child rearing. We love and enjoy the great outdoors, spending 90% of the summer out in the fields and forests, gardening, foraging, tending the wild or just enjoying a swim in the ocean or one of the nearby lakes. 

For us, living on Cape Breton Island is a dream came true and we believe this place could make a suitable “home-base” for many more families with a similar attitude. And so, this is to let the world know: We are seeking like-minded neighbors! 

Other families with kids, or families to be or elderly people who are looking to share their wisdom and knowledge.  People who have a common ideal for living. People who want to join a community based on the principal of live and let live. We are seeking for families (couples and individuals as well) who are looking for a slower pace, who want to lead a more self-sustainable and healthy way of life, families who want to escape the dept slavery and the business “rat race”. We are looking for people who miss the village! 

So, if you are seeking to find this place to create your own Space of Love, plant a garden and co-create the best conditions for healthy living, creative work and raising children – come and meet us, feel the island, the space and consider to become our neighbors. 

We do live on our land but it is not big enough to subdivide it any further. However, there is plenty of vacant, affordable land available close-by. 

We envision a Cape Breton made up of many happy, healthy families. Families from all parts of Canada and maybe even the world. (Families from different social and cultural backgrounds). Families made up from elders, adults, children and grandchildren, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews and brothers and sisters, both by blood and in spirit. Families who are united by the idea of the perfection of their dwelling space – united in creating their own beautiful oasis’ and co-creating and fitting together their blooming space with all the other blooming spaces around them to make one big Space of Love – maybe even an Island of Love – and this island may lead the way for other communities around the world to a happy and sustainable future for all of us. 

If this resonates positively with you, please get in touch with us! (also find a more elaborate description of our project on our website) 

Our space is open to visitors year round; please message before your arrival. 

We are looking forward to you.

Best,
the &quot;Wild acres&quot; family

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23176&quot;&gt;North Star Family Ranch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are a Homesteaders, Preppers, Survivalists and Freedom Loving Patriots Intentional Community with a &quot;Bug Out&quot; option. Our objective is to establish a Sustainable Homestead for Full or Part Time Residency that has the added benefit of providing each person / member the following: 1. Share / Live with each other at pre-set “Bug Out” locations during times of disasters, 2. Share / teach each other their unique abilities - skills and knowledge, and to 3. Share / combine each others resources – possessions and finances with the community as a whole. In other words, every member working together as one to help each other.

Why? Because: A) The world is restless and now has the potential to rapidly digress into a state of political, financial, environmental and/or natural disaster chaos. B) Depending on the Government or some other Social Entity to protect you during a collapse is a no go, so self reliance is a must. And C) Joining forces is far better in every way, less work, much safer and more cost effective, than attempting to go it alone. Having a Network of skilled and trustworthy people / friends plus the option of different housing locations is the ideal Survival Scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/north-star-family-ranch/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/north-star-family-ranch/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;All Homesteaders, Preppers, Survivalists and Freedom Loving Patriots who are willing to work together as one cohesive group are now invited to join a unique Sustainable Intentional Community with a &quot;Bug Out&quot; option. Our plan is to have three safety locations / evacuations zones, one each in Northern and Southern USA, and one out of the country. A place where you can come as follows: 1. Short Term visit as a “Vacationing Member” - with optional classes, 2. Live and Work there full or part time as a “Residential Member” - additional requirements do apply, and/or 3. Extended Emergency stay as a “Hardship Member” - come “Bug Out” when a disaster hits your area.

And just so you know, we are not a doomsday group, rather we are a very happy, normal, friendly, sincere and caring group of people who are hopeful about having a good future, Plus we believe in God, live by the Ten Commandments, and love our country, families and one another. But just in case there is a future disaster, like a grid down, large natural or man made disaster, and or a government collapse, we intend to make a positive impact on people's lives by getting them ready for that scenario, nevertheless, we hope that a bad outcome never happens.

My Story

Although Sol Works is an idea developed by one, the codification of the idea will be something which will be solidified and agreed upon by the five founding member families, thus ensuring the elimination of any feeling that any one person’s opinion matters more than another. As the originator of the idea, I voluntarily abdicate the authority position in favor of a plurality which I know a community commited to this diet can achieve. 

My name is Alfred, but in community, I’ll be known by my spiritual name. For now, Alfred is fine. 

I’ve been working with raw, vegan living since 2012. I’ve experimented with almost every permutation of the diet to varying degrees of success and failure while living primarily in México, but also passing through Central American and parts of South America.
It wasn’t until late 2016 that I happened upon a very sacred way to eat this diet: 100% fresh. No condiments. No intoxicants. No medicine. Nothing more than the fruits and vegetables were taken in. 

This is a way of eating raw, vegan that I haven’t known many to walk. But, I’m looking for others who see the poetry in it. Because, it is truly transcendent. The exceptions to 100% change this way of eating from a spiritual pathway to a diet, and the difference is powerful. So, to keep the pathway is fascinating me, constantly surprising me with its power to protect from all manner of physical, mental, and spiritual disease. This way of eating is an act of grace given by creation during this time on the planet, and thus, for me, it amounts to a very tender and dear, gentle and non-exclusive religion. 

The only thing which any are required to join this pathway is to eat this pathway. That’s it.
 
I’ve discovered during my journey a sacred truth: that what we put into our body creates a pathway. Thus, in order to walk together as a community, we absolutely must keep the agreed upon and pure. We all have to understand it as a sacred choice, one which we never violate in public or private, on our shared land or in very distant landscapes. If we do this together, we will see a clear picture together which allows us to make decisions, even very tough ones with true insight into the deeper objective reality which we share. 
For those who are interested in this community but do not eat completely 100% fresh and raw, vegan or for those who do not even believe it is possible, I invite you into conversation. Transitions are necessary for all of us, and I am aware that eating this way in some locations on the planet is next to impossible. 

I will say from my own experience that for those who have tried raw, vegan, but never tried it this way, it’s a profoundly different experience from consuming dehydrated food, packaged raw goods, nuts and seeds, or the occasional vegan meal.  
Moreover, if you find any clarity or logic in what I’ve written here, just know that it is born from the clarity of my diet right now.
Papaya and Banana in the morning. A salad of cabbage, cilantro, mandarin orange, tomato, cucumber, carrot, and bell pepper for lunch. The water from two coconuts during the day. A bit of watermelon. The flesh from one of the coconuts. A bit more cucumber and tomato for dinner. That’s all. 

Everything was purchased from the local market. Everything was raw. Everything was fresh. Nothing else went into my body today. And I feel fine. 

Currently, I find myself on the Northernmost island in the island chain known as Vanuatu. While this is my physical location, I am open to the formation of Sol Works in other locations.

But, I do invite all interested to deeply consider Vanuatu. It has an unusual condition, a very sacred one in our modern world. It boasts very clear air and areas with very clean water. It has a native population in the countryside which still grows a great deal of its own food. It boasts a market which still defaults towards more seasonal eating. Organic is more the norm than the exception. And it’s still possible to import sacred seed here. 

It also has downsides. Land is offered on 75-year lease rather than outright purchase. Any raw, vegan community here would need to be active in conservation efforts and outreach to the wider community in order to maintain what is still pristine.

But, on the side of the great light, many here naturally eat far less meat than in other parts of the world. One can still see many snacking on fruit during the day. And one can feel the fruit’s presence in the smiles of the people. 

Much more could be said about Vanuatu, but too much will certainly feel like an attempt to sell a place that I’m only now coming to know. So, I’ll simply invite a conversation about this place with any whom would also like a conversation with me about community in general. 

My personal story is long and varied as are they all. And if you reach out in this direction, I will share with you openly about my personal history, and I ask that you do the same. 

To join community together is a sacred commitment, one which I do not take lightly. But, I do, with any whom I join, take your hand lightly and lovingly, knowing that we are sacrificing to be this way together and therefore must protect and nurture one another even when we disagree. 

For now, that’s all. 

Please contact me for more information or to talk.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23180&quot;&gt;Hofkollektiv Zwetschke - association for the promotion of solidary and ecological life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To promote solidarity, ecological life, organic agriculture, collective property and income sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/hofkollektiv-zwetschke-association-for-the-promotion-of-solidary-and-ecological-life/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/hofkollektiv-zwetschke-association-for-the-promotion-of-solidary-and-ecological-life/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Not so far from the town of Zwettl, Lower Austria, directly on the riverside edge of the tiny village of Negers, you can find the Holzmühle, the  „wood-mill“, a former sawmill on the Zwettl river, with history going back to the 13th century. 
The present mill buildings have 700 sq. meters useable space, plus a large hall, not to forget circa 17 acres (7.5 hectares) of surrounding land, with meadows, arable fields, orchards and woodland. In addition, there is a small hydro-electric plant.

The Holzmühle has been collectivized since the start of 2014 and is used by members of the non-profit association for the promotion of solidarity and ecological living, the Hofkollektiv Zwetschke.

The association makes the rooms and land available for a multitude of uses, for example, local, regional and international network meetings, artistic and cultural presentations, political activities, a regional food cooperative, educational events, promotion of methods supporting health and of therapeutic methods, collectively useable workshops and machines, etc............

The land and wooded areas are cultivated and used following basic ecological principles, with the aim of preserving and improving the soil fertility and the bio-diversity in the natural cycles.

In addition, the Holzmühle provides living space, as the various activities are organized, looked after and made possible by the residents of the Hofkollektiv – the Zwetschken

Our collective, the Hofkollektiv Zwetschke is, at present, a community of 5 adult members, 4 resident non-members  and one baby girl, and we put lots of energy, time and love into the Holzmühle. In the long term, our aim is to grow into a group of between fifteen and twenty people. We organize our communal life together free from hierarchy, needs-based and in solidarity.

We organize ourselves structurally and economically as a collective, giving and taking all of our income and expenditure into and from a common purse which ensures that both common and individual needs can be satisfied.

We break new ground and take alternative ways in a variety of sectors of life.

Wheresoever we are in disagreement with the current social or economic norms, constraints or mechanisms, we experiment with alternatives, e.g. in the usage of rooms and space, the social forms and the organization of labor, the provision of food stuffs, and also in questions of economy and finance.</description>

      <name>Casper, WY Afterworld Transition Town</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23182&quot;&gt;Casper, WY Afterworld Transition Town&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We hope to create a sustainable community through which to preserve the best of humanity in the worst of times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/casper-wy-afterworld-transition-town/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/casper-wy-afterworld-transition-town/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We're hoping to find others who'd like to purchase homes in Casper in the West Garden Creek subdivision or a nearby one (preferably West Garden Creek) just to the west of Nancy English Park and to the north of Dead Horse Hill (find us on NextDoor) who'd like to create an urban community of preppers who are focused on trying to get off the grid and coordinating gardens and security and preparing for what we regrettably anticipate as the collapse of modern industrial civilization (contributed to by climate change, population, and peak oil) and with it the global economy as it becomes increasingly clear that the voting public will not realize the gravity of these problems until after it is far too late (hate to be gloom and doom, but we're pragmatic realists).   We're also hoping to network with other like-minded people across the state and region well in advance of that in order to teach each other tradable skills we're learning and establish trade networks in advance.   

Our peculiar group thus far includes individuals in committed monogamist relationships and we would not identify as polyamorous and have thus far agreed to attempting to seek other like-minded individuals.  We do identify mostly as spiritual or non-religious, with most of us identifying as agnostic or atheist fascinated with the study of human cultures and religions, and many of us open to more eastern philosophies and not hostile to those with faith provided that it is not in conflict with our shared values of shared responsibility and sacrifice and we before me and people over profit.   Most of us thus far identify politically as liberals.   We've been disappointed to find mostly religious cultists or right wing militia types in our search for others who wish to prepare to create a transition town.

Unlike many preppers, we aren't gleefully excited for a day when we might have to protect resources from marauders or become mauraders ourselves in the exigency of our survival.  We'd rather prepare long in advance to create a cooperative prosocial community that necessarily must be ready to defend itself but is prepared to do so through numbers and preparation now and networking to ensure our families can survive catastrophic collapse of economy and modern industrial society, and would prefer to create infrastructure in our city that can avert the kind of desperation that might lead to that kind of violence in the first place.   

Our group would like to create a group of individuals beginning in this neighborhood (it's aging population creates the opportunity for a repurposing of the subdivision as an intentional community) that could survive a collapse while also purchasing land in a barren location with a deep well drilled, fertile soil trucked, and every member of our community having four-season trailers that could be used at this &quot;bug out&quot; community, with this neighborhood the location we've prepped for our return after things have settled down.  

We'd prefer that you are only a light/moderate/social user of any substance because substance abuse is inimical to group survival, and would also prefer if you have mental health conditions that you share those in full disclosure and not rely upon pharmaceutical solutions to cope with them.  We have an interest in learning aquaponics and coordinating cooperative food production in back and front yards and using rainwater catchment, and highly encourage solar and wind energy additions, installation of rocket mass heaters in all homes, and for each family who joins us to be involved in their own preparations for security and otherwise (we are not pacifist absolutists although we'd prefer to remain to be unless defense is necessary; we'd prefer to remain nonviolent).   

Finally, it's worth noting we're less than half a block away from Nancy English Park in Casper which could be used for community farming and greenhouses in the event of collapse and we as a community would work (as none of us are wealthy) to cooperate to buy materials for pallisades and for PVC greenhouses to ensure that between our yards and the park, we have sufficient fertile soil to feed our entire community.   Plus, due to the hill behind us, CY Ave, and the park and commmercial district, we have some natural boundaries that make this an ideal location to protect.   We should also note another thing that makes this location fairly ideal is that Garden Creek flows right next to it so we can be assured of drinking water and possibly irrigate some in the park.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23183&quot;&gt;Tribe of the Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The idea is to return to our home and rightful place among the living world and community of Mother Nature.
Leaving behind every thing that hinders this aim.  We are much more than this bag of muscles and bones.  Get in touch to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/tribe-of-the-multi-colored-phoenix/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/tribe-of-the-multi-colored-phoenix/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This community is a place for people to be real.  A place to rediscover what the essence of being human is.  We hold all life to be sacred and non-violence does not mean we just treat other humans well, but ALL other mammals, reptiles, fowl, and fish.  We are vegetarian and/or vegan and do not KILL ANY other animal for food.  It is time we acknowledge the capacity to love and communicate that resides in other living creatures.  It is also time we begin to reassume our lost, forgotten place in the circle of life as the species to bring understanding, harmony, peace, and love to all of Creation.

As such, our guidance comes from the Spirit of Love and Truth and Mother Nature.  We do not discriminate against, race, age, gender, sexual preferences, etc.  As a part of this community, members leave their religious, cultural predispositions, and traditions where they belong....  in the old, decaying fiction humanity as been tricked into living for millenia.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23184&quot;&gt;Cristo Morpho&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are a spiritual and sustainable community. We have been offering a volunteer program for 5 years during the winter season. Seeking to connect with like minded people or an established community seeking a location for a year round eco-village. 



This passage has been somewhat prophetic for us....

“I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.  I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.  I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees. I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house.(hired local workers and volunteers) I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me. (Locals in Buena Vista raise cows, pigs and goats and chickens)  I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, and a harem as well—the delights of a man’s heart.” (Ecclesiastes 2:4-8 New International Version)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/cristo-morpho/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/cristo-morpho/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Being a part of Cristo Morpho Community is invigorating. It’s a safe place to express your feelings. Every action, no matter how small, is important. A web of beautiful connections between people happens once you start to serve and live among our community with an open heart. When our community gathers together, we eat, pray, dance, and make glorious music. When together, we provide love and support for each other. We sit close enough to reach out and touch one another. We listen with open hearts as we share the intimate parts of our lives. When problems unfold or decisions must be made, we pray about it. We find a clear consensus among the community before any decision is carried out.

We are currently categorized as a seasonal community. We gather primarily from November to May. We have several volunteers and visitors who are the foundation for the Cristo Morpho Community. Cristo Morpho is a Vermont based mutual-benefit non-profit, which means it was created to serve our members. The programs that Cristo Morpho offers are non-denominational. Within Cristo Morpho Community we accept you as you are, regardless of your beliefs, physical attributes or emotional state. Our position is to respect other religions, cultures, and traditions. Many of our visitors and volunteers have faith in Jesus. As a spiritual community, we actively participate in other spiritual pursuits such as yoga and fitness classes, indigenous traditions, non-violent communication, and share circles. We live as a sustainable community. We grow our own food, have gravity-fed water, compost, and recycle.

History of purchase....
In 2005, the funder purchased nearly 100 acres of land with a three-bedroom home in Buena Vista, which is on the Caribbean side of Costa Rica. This land is designated as the future site for our sustainable spiritual community. We are the stewards of this beautiful, rainforest land with a 40-foot waterfall, and the famous translucent, blue morpho butterfly is frequently seen fluttering above the three brooks. In the morning, I wake up to the howler monkeys, and at dusk the parrots squawk and toucans soar from the treetops.

Founder...

Randolph C. Phelps is a native Vermonter and a resident of Costa Rica. He is the founder of the Vermont non-profit, Cristo Morpho, which established a sustainable, spiritual community located on the Caribbean side of Costa Rica, called The Cristo Morpho Community. During winters, he directs the Cristo Morpho Volunteer Program. This is a Christ-based program that focuses on immersion into the community through individual service projects, and fostering spiritual growth. In 2006, he purchased nearly 100 acres in Costa Rica, which includes a forty-foot waterfall, in the canopy rainforest region of Buena Vista.

For ten years he was a regular volunteer during summer months at various spiritual communities in upstate New York. He served in the wellness center at Omega Institute in Rhinebeck and assisted with mountain retreats at The Abode of the Message in New Lebanon. Randy is a certified yoga therapist, specializing in chronic conditions and restorative postures. He is an Integral yoga teacher and a regular volunteer at Satchidananda Ashram (Yogaville) in Buckingham, Virginia.

I wrote two books which are on our website: Swan Song &amp;amp; the Cosmic Guru as an enjoyable way to invite people who resonate with my story, to become a part of our sustainable, spiritual community.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23186&quot;&gt;Whatevers Clever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To enjoy all that remote Alaska has to offer while still being just connected enough to the grid that we can participate in urban life when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/whatevers-clever/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/whatevers-clever/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I would like to organize an intentional sustainable community. I've been doing research for years in sustainable communities and I know so many people that just don't want to have to work 40 hours a week to move ahead. The technology required for completely self sufficient low cost living has moved leaps and bounds in the last few years with things like inexpensive and reliable solar panels and battery banks and integrated bio-system aquaponics etc etc.

It won't be difficult or expensive to build a complex of tiny home cabins on a large tract of land just far enough outside of a city so that a group of people could live together with a very low work input and very low cost. They could share a small condo in town with bunk beds for the 3 days or so a week they would each need to work in order to support their lives. Some could exist entirely though remote internet work or retirement income. I can design and build the entire infrastructure of the community and help maintain it. It's only a matter of finding the right 10 or 20 people. This is the initial stage of finding and organizing these people.

Farming will be done on the property in the summer and shared hunting and fishing trips. A large greenhouse will be constructed that is productive even in the dead of winter.

Anyone who wants to live off grid but doesn't have the entire spectrum of skills alone. It could be artists, woodsman, retired folks, people on disability that can still do simple chores around the greenhouse, pretty much anyone that wants to have a small inclusive community well outside of the over regulated cities.

No one says that this will be incredibly easy. It will be a combination of the skills and abilities of the people who choose to participate and the financial and other resources that they bring to the project. With the right people and skills and financing yes it could actually be easy.

I'm looking for more of a remote community that isn't ritzy but has all of the creature comforts.

There are methods to incorporate among a group of people that prevent every legal issue that you might be concerned about and have been used successfully over and over. You would get a legally enforceable fair share and no one can take your personal portion of the project. You could sell out at any time and the other members would have first right of refusal. Condominium and town home complexes are organized this way.

One of the central needs is to find an area or areas where the typical permitting issues simply don't exist. In the unincorporated boroughs of Alaska, you don't need permits for almost anything... Nearly anything goes and there are plenty of other places like this in the United States... There are already several of these communities in Alaska and others are popping up. Ideally I would like 2 locations. One in Alaska and one on the Big Island in Hawaii. People could stay in either location as their health and the weather dictates.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23187&quot;&gt;New Story Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To support a true agrarian community and to help beginning farmers get their start. We have lived at Earthaven Ecovillage and the Possibility Alliance as well as, visited many communities in America and Australia. We struggle living outside of community however, we have not found a community that emphasizes sustainable farming so we endeavor to help create one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/new-story-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/new-story-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;A &quot;story&quot; is a scenario interrelating man, the world, and the gods.&quot;To enact&quot; is to live so as to make a story a reality. &quot;Culture&quot; is a people enacting a story. If you believe that the world belongs to man, you will see all other life as a resource. If you believe that man belongs to the world, you see all other life as partners. On our farm, we are surrounded by annual agriculture and although we grew up eating from this system and have gratitude for that, we also see that annual agriculture is intrinsically unsustainable. Even at it's best, it is extractive and erosive, leading in time to desertification. We want to enact a new story that puts humans back in partnership with all other creation.

You want to be peasants?!

After reading this piece in The Hand Sculpted House, you may just want to be one too.
 
&quot;Peasants satisfy their own basic needs: they grow their food, build the houses they live in, often make their own clothes. Most peasants collect medicinal herbs, treat medical emergencies, supply their family entertainment. They experience fully what they do every day; they have time-they feel joy. Their culture is integral, it makes sense. Farmers by contrast grow things to sell. With what they earn from their products, they buy their groceries, building materials, clothes, entertainment and medical insurance. They must also drive to market, pay taxes, perhaps send their kids to agricultural college. Increasingly they must buy machinery, seeds, farm chemicals. Farmers have no time to directly enjoy satisfying their own needs, so they purchase their satisfactions; they buy ready-made clothing and &quot;convenience&quot; foods.&quot;
We feel that food is so grossly undervalued in the american culture that it is often insulting to the grower to sell it. Our aim is fair energy exchange and many times that is not with currency. Our main goal is to sustain ourselves and our immediate community while facilitating a habitat that promotes diversity in the natural community around us. Our surplus will be &quot;banked&quot; in the soil and the life in and above it.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23189&quot;&gt;Brooksville cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We would strive to live together in unity and share resources whenever possible but also try to maintain individualism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/brooksville-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/brooksville-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are interested in the concept of cohousing. We are also very interested in the idea of smaller housing or tiny housing but am flexible on those ideas. 

We would like to have a variety of individuals from older individuals to couples to families to foreign exchange students. 
Have not yet decided on the location or size of the community but we are located near Brooksville at this moment.

Please contact us with any questions we would love to get together with you and discuss your ideas as well and what we could do to move forward.</description>

      <name>Poet's Plaggen</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23190&quot;&gt;Poet's Plaggen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The house is dedicated to providing affordable workforce and student housing and growing our own food. We have surrounded the building with a 20-tree food forest as well as raised beds. Being a quiet community in a quiet neighborhood, we are dedicated to non-violent communication and lowering our environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/poets-plaggen/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/poets-plaggen/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Poet's Plaggen is a suburban homestead in a quiet golf course community. The name of the community is a play on words of the name of the neighborhood, Bardmoor. Since a moor refers to ancient boggy soil and the development is built on mostly sand, we decided to rename it plaggen - an extremely fertile anthropogenic soil. The house has a library, workshop, home office, pool, 5 bedrooms and two baths. We will be expanding to 7 bedrooms and 3 baths in the near future and eventually take the house off-grid.</description>

      <name>Beltane Hill Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23191&quot;&gt;Beltane Hill Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Creating a cohesive village life of sustainable, practical, innovative ways; improving all our relations --to neighbors, nature, and our own spiritual growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/beltane-hill-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/beltane-hill-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Beltane Hill has an integrated relationship with AzureGreen –a business employing 25 people; along with a community center hosting meals and events –Blossom-Center Middlefield. It has a 27 year relationship with the people and land of the tiny, self-governing town of Middlefield –its forest and fields, and 22 people per square mile. 
Four of the Co-founders bring a Wiccan / Nature-Spirituality perspective, including its belief that everyone has their own spiritual path. We strive for a balance of independence and collaboration, tailored to individual tastes and skill. We pursue living lightly on earth, and want active participants in local governance and decision-making.  We seek inspirational practices that support the flourishing of spirit.
In 2008, 125 people gathered for the ground-blessing ritual prior to constructing our 8,000+ sf of common house / community center space. For the past 3 years, every Tuesday at 5:30pm 80 or more people gather for community dinners. These dinners make an excellent time to visit and get a feel for the larger community and its affinity sub-sets.
There is land available adjoining the common house, and further away, as well as single-family homes for sale in the neighborhood. Prospective members interested in only room(s) in an existing house would need to meet with existing householders to see if there is compatibility.  Design of new homes would rest with its future residents, and not be planned by the community as a whole.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23192&quot;&gt;unfolding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To meet the diverse needs of sensitive beings is our mission. We are all still unfolding… I would like to tell a story. A story of what might be, crafted by the ideas of children who believe nothing is impossible, their teachers, care givers, students, and those seeking they know not what. This story encompasses many whom have been drawn into the lives of an artistic, holistic caregiver who over analyzes everything, and an absolutely beautiful work of art we call Christophrax. Named by our Aspergian teen for describing ze whom is as varied as the moods of the sea, as the emotional, physical, spiritual tides of chronic pain, and living against all odds, sculpted by doctors, nurses, and a system which believes it is a caregiving system, but can not see it’s own limitations can create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/unfolding/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/unfolding/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;A not-for-profit intentional community focused around those of us who are sensitive, disabled, from overseas, those who have chosen to live more holistically. We are forming a community in Southern Illinois based upon sustainability, environmental care, self care, homeschooling, animal rescue, children's book writing, video game creating; expressing a whole, holistic view of an artistic expression of life. How an attitude of gratitude expresses itself in resilience, simple joys, following the flow of children, the disabled, rehabilitating a patient with patience.</description>

      <name>Phoenix Den</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23193&quot;&gt;Phoenix Den&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; An intentional community seeking to fill a gap in New York City for queer supportive housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/phoenix-den/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/phoenix-den/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Phoenix Den will provide supportive housing to LGBTQ+ people recovering from mental illness and co-occurring disorders. This is a community of people who are not in crisis and are currently sober, and have a strong drive towards living in recovery, but need some support maintaining a newfound stability. 

This community has 3 main facets it is trying to fulfill: queer supportive housing. With its LGBTQ+ focus, it will not be separated by gender, and people of any gender will be welcome to stay here. The space will not be cis-hetero-assuming, and LGBTQ+ resources will be made available. This is a factor that makes our form of supportive housing accessible to a community that is often left excluded from what are normally strictly gendered spaces. As a supportive community, we hope to foster independence and positive recovery from mental illness and co-occurring disorders. This will include providing a stable place to live, with shared food and cleaning and cooking schedules, as well as mental health resources such as weekly groups and various other support options. This is not meant to be a place of treatment, but rather a stepping stone to independent living (though permanent living is not an impossibility) for those who need help cementing their recovery. We hope to provide an affordable and accessible form of housing to people that would benefit from this vision.

Phoenix Den is meant to be a place of stability maintenance and recovery support. We are a group of people thoroughly invested in living our lives as best we can with the cards we have been dealt. The Phoenix is a mythical bird that is continuously reborn from its ashes. It carries with it a message of power and resilience, despite struggle, despite relapse, it carries everlasting strength and perseverance.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23194&quot;&gt;Florida Homestead Botanical Gardens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our efforts consist of practicing simple living, developing a close, harmonious relationship with the Earth and the cultivation and preservation of rare, threatened and endangered edible and medicinal plants, vegetables and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/florida-homestead-botanical-gardens/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/florida-homestead-botanical-gardens/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&quot;They paved paradise and put up a parking lot. We've got to get ourselves back to the garden.&quot; ~Joni Mitchell

&quot;In the past 70 years, 94% of the plants, vegetables and seeds we eat for food have become extinct. We have lost, and are now loosing, more plants, fish, birds and animals than in all other extinction events combined. We have entered the Anthropocene.&quot;

___________________________________________

Florida Homestead and Botanical Gardens is a private, off-grid, self-sustaining, 6 acre forest homestead community located in central Florida.

We are looking for established and enthusiastic Earth workers, who have a background in &quot;back to lander&quot; agriculture and have the &quot;soul&quot; desire to live simply and dedicate their lives to the preservation of rare and endangered plant species, practice ecological Earth based stewardship and live a non-consumer, carbon negative, communal lifestyle.

We are not a production farm, a CSA or a co-op. We are a private homestead that maintains gardens of rare and endangered plant species that need to be continually cultivated in order to survive. They are not sold, but simply maintained and protected. We do not accept visitors and are not open to the public.

We are a closed loop, self-sufficient, ecotopian, homestead community where virtually every aspect of modern life is holistically reexamined.

Interns will be engaged in maintaining the gardens, chickens, tilapia aquaculture systems, bee keeping, clearing new gardens, chopping wood, turning compost, mulching, weeding, green house maintenance, planting, grafting, gardening by moon phase, propagating and seed saving and to see first hand how it all functions in a self-sustaining, closed loop system.

We grow our own food, generate our own power, reuse waste water, make our own compost, potting soil and make, fix or repair most everything we need. There is no pay or stipend, but there is also no need for money here.

All lodging, meals, toiletries, utilities, laundry and wifi are provided. Periodically, long term interns will participate in plant shows or farmers markets and sell plants, soap, vegetables or art work if they need to generate additional income.

While here, interns will build and maintain: off-grid solar systems, mirco power grids, passive solar hot water heaters, 12 volt water systems, wind generator turbines, cisterns, wells, rainwater catchment systems, aquaculture systems, grey water systems, water filtration systems, irrigation systems and on site weather stations. A background or understanding of these systems is A+.

On the domestic side, interns are required to help with dishes, laundry, making meals, canning, fermenting, bread making, long term food preservation and general housekeeping.

This is Florida. The summers are hot and humid, we sweat and work the Earth. Maintaining clean and tidy living quarters and daily personal hygiene is required and mandatory.

We put high emphasis on re-skilling. We have a blacksmith shop, a home based foundry, a wood working shop, a welding and metal shop, an art studio, a fiber arts studio and a full service automotive and small engine repair shop complete with tools, a pit and lift.

Interns will learn blacksmithing, wood working, fiber arts, welding, plumbing, construction, tile and drywall, electrical and engine diagnosis and repair. Being &quot;mechanically inclined&quot;, having a understanding of construction and basic  hand and power tools is A+.

We also make our own medicinal soaps, salves, tinctures and practice holistic medicine. Having knowledge of medicinal plants is A+.

We also have a number of looms, spinning wheels and treadle sewing machines. Interns are encouraged to build their own tri-looms, weave shawls, do art and make their own clothes from recycled materials. Being artistic and having a background in fiber arts and knowing how to use a sewing machine is A+.

Computers, video games, televisions, radios and ear buds are prohibited. Cell phone use is limited to personal communication and research only. It is important to understand the environmental, health and societal impact of these kinds of devices.

We do have wifi and decent cell service here. We also have a video CD player and have weekly &quot;popcorn and movie nights&quot; consisting of documentaries on Earth climate issues, pollution, organic farming and simple living.

We have two &quot;clean&quot; shelters for interns. A primitive guest cabin for short timers and an intern apartment that has a full bathroom, shower, wood stove, fireplace and kitchen. We also have two RV sites with hookups and a full outdoor kitchen with fire pit.

This is a &quot;farmily&quot; setting and a private residence. We only accept happy, peaceful, loving, harmonious people that want to live and learn in a quiet, forest based, communal setting.

If you are indeed longing to reintegrate with the Web of Life. If you understand the importance of a non-consumer, self-reliant, zero waste lifestyle. If you have a longing to unplug from the material matrix, move to a forest, grow your own food, cultivate rare and endangered plants, be artistic and live a quiet, peaceful, harmonious, ecotopian, communal forest lifestyle with like-minded people, then, and with mettā, Ewha has heard you... Welcome home!</description>

The village design is compact, accessible and ecologically oriented, balancing the dynamics of community engagement with the needs for personal space.  The building design and construction is aesthetically inspiring, ecologically responsible and crafted with the help of skilled local tradesfolk. Our residential culture is oriented towards the observance of Jewish traditions, rituals and cycles while maintaining a spiritually inclusive consciousness</description>

The hope for our community is to be a place of learning and healing. 
     There isn’t a plan written in stone, because come what may, but here are a few things we would like to build and invite others to come help:
An active rotating field of livestock and annual vegetables
Buildings using clay slip and straw
A large space for creative work and dance
A permaculture forest garden
Hospice for our elders
Foster care for children
Offer work trades for travelers

     We are on 10 acres, half forest and half field. 
We have all our permits for building our first dwelling, which we had an architect design for code. It’s clay and timber framed and the build begins next year (2019).
      It’s been such a mad scramble since we bought the land that we haven’t been able to work it or put seed down, hopefully that can happen next year too.
     Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to exchange labor or need a place to stay in the area.</description>
