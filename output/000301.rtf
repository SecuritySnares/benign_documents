. It sets out to present the counter-argument for diversity and legal pluralism within the EU, the emphasis throug
hout being on public and procedural law. The argument rests on the belief that a pluralist Europe is not inconsistent with a commitment to internationalism. Cultural diversity is valuable in its own right and is a basic strength of the European enterprise
,
 providing a valuable genetic store of cultural experience, essential as a foundation for constitutional and legal experiment and as a yardstick against which to measure the infant institutions of the EU. The need for diversity is indirectly recognised in
 
the Preamble to the TEU, which confirms the desire of the Masters of the Treaties "to deepen the solidarity between their peoples while respecting their history, their culture and their traditions". This commitment is reflected in the Draft Charter of Hum
an Rights, which proclaims respect for "cultural, religious and linguistic diversity" }{\cs18\expnd0\expndtw-3\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s17\qj\sa240\nowidctlpar\tx-720\hyphpar0\adjustright \f16\expndtw-3\lang2057\cgrid {\cs18\lang1033 \~\~\~\~

\par 
\par In modern liberal democracies which acknowledge the need for limited government, the authority of the judiciary is traditionally justified in terms of the rule of law, a principle with which lawyers tend natural
ly to empathise strongly. This inclines them to read arguments for democracy as an argument for legislative sovereignty in its narrowest and least reflective sense. The rule of law clearly forms an essential element of liberal democracy and plays its part
 
in providing the theoretical basis for an independent judiciary but it forms only one side of a balanced constitution or debate about a balanced constitution. This chapter is premissed on the ideal of pluralist democracy, seen as the best, though also the
 
most demanding, form of government that contemporary society has to offer. For the purposes of the argument, a simple but robust definition of democracy has been adopted as a form of popular political self-government with "the people of a country deciding
 for themselves the contents of the laws that organize and regulate their political association }{\cs18\expnd0\expndtw-3\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s17\qj\nowidctlpar\tx-720\hyphpar0\adjustright \f16\expndtw-3\lang2057\cgrid {\cs18\lang1033 \~\~

\par }}}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 ". In this chapter, the pol
itical components of democracy have been stressed, though the author accepts that the balance of power in modern constitutions is typically more complex. The true position is reflected in the Preamble to the TEU, where the Member States confirm their "att
a
chment to the principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and of the rule of law", a formulation not changed at Amsterdam. It should be noted that liberty and democracy here take precedence over respect for human
 rights and fundamental freedoms and of the rule of law. 
\par 
\par Underlying the argument of this paper are two further assumptions. First, law is seen not merely as a toolkit of autonomous concepts readily transferable in time and space, but as a cultural artifac
t embedded in the society in which it functions. This conception of law is discussed in Section II.2. Secondly, the paper maintains that a legal system is part of the governmental arrangements of a given state or society. A legal system is not and never c
a
n be "autonomous" in the sense of lying outside the system of governance, though this is not to deny the judicial independence demanded in modern European constitutions, which often finds expression through the doctrine of separation of powers. (In any so
ciety whose constitution is written, the distinction will be self-evident).  
\par 
\par Neither "harmonisation" nor "convergence", which bear broadly the same meaning, are terms of art and in this paper they are distinguished. The term "harmonisation" is here reserv
ed for a conscious and negotiated process of harmonisation, culminating in a rulemaking procedure or legislative act. The European Commission has in the past sponsored several efforts at legal harmonisation, notably in the area of consumer protection law 
and products liability }{\cs18\expnd0\expndtw-3\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s17\qj\sa240\nowidctlpar\tx-720\hyphpar0\adjustright \f16\expndtw-3\lang2057\cgrid {\cs18\lang1033 \~\~\~\~}{\cs18\lang1033\super \chftn }{\lang1033 
 EEC 93/13 Directive on unfair terms in consumer contracts and EEC 85/374 Directive concerning liability for defective products.}}}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 
. Latterly, however, the Commission - perhaps more sensitive to the problems of harmonisation in a wider and more divergent Community - has been more selective; rather than attempt broad, general harmonisation, it has sought agreement on specific action i
n limited areas: a common law of remedies inside the public procurement directives, for example }{\cs18\expnd0\expndtw-3\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \s17\qj\sa240\nowidctlpar\tx-720\hyphpar0\adjustright \f16\expndtw-3\lang2057\cgrid {

\expnd0\expndtw-3 
 and the law of judicial procedure have so far had negative outcomes. Indeed, the Storme Commission, the semi-official body set up under the sponsorship of the European Parliament to harmonise procedural law and to draw up a "European Judic
ial Code", ultimately concluded that the basic distinction in European legal systems between adversarial and inquisitorial procedures was "so deeply enshrined in the respective legal cultures as to make harmonisation practically unfeasible" }{

\par The term "convergence" can be used in several senses. It may simply denote the coming together of legal systems

\par To the ECJ, "horizontal divergence" in the sense of variance between the legal principles and procedures of the Member States, is often probl
ematic. But in ironing out discrepancies, an equally difficult problem of horizontal divergence may be passed to national courts. This occurs when rules applicable in different areas of domestic law diverge because of the introduction of a principle of EC
 
law which is out of synchronisation with the existing rules of the domestic legal system. This gap creates a quandary for a national judiciary charged with maintaining so far as possible the integrity of the domestic legal system. The standard reaction of
 
EC lawyers to problems of horizontal convergence is to treat them simply as a question of "levelling up" to a common EC standard, generally assumed to be "higher law" in both senses of the phrase. The fallacy of the "levelling up" concept is discussed in 
Section IV.

as largely defined in terms of the absence of representative institutions at EC level. Only after direct elections were conceded in 1979 did attention turn from representation to the problem of sovereignty as manifested in the EP's lack of sovereign lawma

ing powers. Significantly, both variants on the theme of representative democracy were under discussion in the formative years when the ECJ was forging the basic constitutional principles of the Community; both were reflected in some of the Court's most a

bitious jurisprudence of the period; and both are compatible with integrationism (Below, Section III.1). The robust definition adopted in this paper of popular democratic government is incompatible both with the notion of legitimation through the doctrine
 of "passive consent" and with elite government, even in the modified two-tier theory of European democracy, whereby popular democracy at national level justifies elite governance in the Community.

\par What we are seeing is a variant of the "open flank" argument, according to which demo
cratic deficit at European level, or shifts in the balance of power between European and national institutions, impact unfavourably on democratic government at national level. Daniel Wincott calls this the "perversion" of European democracy by the two-tie

 shifting the balance of power at national level. That a substantial horizontal relocation of power from parliamentary institutions towards a non-elected judiciary is already occurring, and that this transfer of power to the judiciary is visible at both n
ational and Community levels, is widely accepted; indeed, it is a matter of self-congratulation for many lawyers. These developments are dangerous in that they inhibit and supersede democratic discussion and debate.

\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 mentalit\'e9}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  is, however, rather p
ersuasive. Legrand points to several features of the common law, such as the way it moves from fact to principle and remedy to rights, which form its "deep structure". When apparently simple concepts such as good faith or fault are transferred from one le
g
al system to another, the methodology of the system will operate to limit the effect of the transplantation. If fault, for example, is installed as the basis of delictual and tortious liability in every European legal system, what is construed as fault ma
y
 vary as considerably over spatial boundaries as it has been seen to do over time periods. Fault is a flexible concept, variable along a spectrum, and a system can easily instal or reinstate strict liability through the doctrine of "presumptive fault"; sy
stems protective of defendants may in practice require proof of \ldblquote grave fault\rdblquote 
. Something very like this has happened with the interpretation of the uniform EC Products Liability Directive, where harmonisation has in practice come to mean approximation. Legrand's }{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 mentalit\'e9}{\expnd0\expndtw-3 
 concept explains why the reality of incorporation is so often "translation". It can indeed be compared with the original notion of the directive in EC law, which required Member States to work towards a given goal, with the flexibility to work with the }
{\ul\expnd0\expndtw-3 mentalit\'e9}{\expnd0\expndtw-3  of their own legal system and not against the grain. This conception has, however, been rendered partially nugatory by the ECJ's promotion of the doctrine of "direct effect".

 is apposite. In English constitutional law, the central doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty can be seen to serve a dual purpose: on the one hand, it simply establishes the hierarchy of legal norms; on the other, it constitutes the fundamental principle

the key functions of administrative law is to provide the citizen with these pathways. In no society does law have a monopoly, but in some societies it is less highly prized than others. It has, for example, been said that "the idea that there could be an

pathways or widening another. Complaints may be diverted into a system where they cannot be appropriately handled or they may dry up altogether. Damage may then be caused to the political culture, ultimately impinging on a society's concept of citizenship

\par The foundations of the EC legal order rest in the Treaty, more especially
 the rule of law ideal embedded in the Preamble. This Treaty status of "high constitutional principle" provides a theoretical legitimation for the whole judge-made construction of EC law; in addition, EC Art 220 (ex 164) establishes the Court as guardian 
of the Treaty, its duty being to see the law observed. 
\par 
\par In line with the requirements and liberal ideology of the EC constitutional culture, the rule of law principle early acquired an unashamedly formalist and procedural interpretation - the classic liber

\par 
\par The purpose of this chapter is to 
link this wide, general debate about constitutions and governance to a narrower debate, conducted mainly between lawyers, about harmonisation and convergence of legal systems. In so doing, it has questioned the use of law as an instrument of political int
e
gration, arguing that legal integration in a political vacuum tilts the balance of power from government and legislature unacceptably far towards the judiciary, modifying in the process relationships between the EU and Member States (the double perversion
 
of democracy.) Implicitly, the chapter also questions law's integrative force. Paradoxically, legal integration may be disintegrative. Essentially parasitic in nature, the EC legal order balances precariously on the props of national legal orders. Clashes
 between the orders which cause repercussions on national constitutions will in time rebound directly on the Community. 
\par 
\par Again, the chapter has attacked both the vision of a "level playing field" of procedural rights and the concept of "levelling up" as es
sentially simplistic and misleading ideas. The realities which underlie the legal doctrines of equality and efficiency  demand a more complex and sophisticated argument about the commensurability of rights and values. Arguing that legal systems are cultur
a
lly linked, the chapter notices differing attitudes to legal remedy and judicialisation. The first division of competencies between national legal orders and the EC was sensitive to these differences but a blurring of the boundary has been noted. Border r
aids in the name of integrationism have led to expanded competence for EC law and its progenitor, the ECJ. 
\par  
\par The ECJ was designed as an international tribunal with a strictly limited remit but it made short work of this restricted mandate. It soon moved to
 establish the supremacy of the law which it administered and had ruled itself alone competent to administer, while alongside it fitted itself out with a toolkit of powerful remedies, used to bind the legal orders of the Member States. A model of law emer
g
ed more formalist and more coercive than the national legal orders of any Member State would offer and arguably ill-adapted to the non-statal constitutional context in which it has to operate. The supremacy principle represents the installation at the hea
rt of a postmodern "Community of Nations" of a Kelsenist conception of legal sovereignty. Pooled sovereignty ought to imply the acknowledgement of "co-ordinately valid legal systems" }{\cs18\expnd0\expndtw-3\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain

\par 
\par But if it is proving difficult to move far from the concept of sovere
ignty in the political arena, then it is harder still to eliminate it inside the legal order. The theory of law as an instrument of command and coercion has qualities of endurance; the tiger is not dead but sleeps. The rush to "constitutionalise" human ri
g
hts and to extrapolate general constitutional principles has permitted the ECJ to buy into the classic hierarchy of legal norms. Rights, in Dworkin's inimitable phrase, are "trumps" through which courts gain power and legitimate their own claim to soverei
gnty. And sovereignty is very much the business of courts.

\par The argument of this paper has been presented somewhat starkly. There is room for a median position between the extreme poles of integrationism and unregenerate pluralism. There are today signs that the ECJ is beginning to understand this. Recent case law
 
is more tentative, more thoughtful and more sensitive to national sensibilities. The Court has recently suggested too that national courts should "apply Community law themselves, and not... resort too hastily to the solution afforded by a reference to the

If a market is to flourish, disputes arising out of business conducted in the market must be resolved consistently with one another, and that requires more than a uniform substantive law. Distortion is bou
