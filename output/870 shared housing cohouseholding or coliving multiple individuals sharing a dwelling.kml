      <name>GYMNOS - A neo-primitive tribe forming</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21660&quot;&gt;GYMNOS - A neo-primitive tribe forming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Naturist Land-Based Tribe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/gymnos-naturist-commune-and-retreat/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/gymnos-naturist-commune-and-retreat/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Hidden away on five private acres in sunny southwest Florida, GYMNOS is a land-based, naturist tribe in formation.  A spacious house, studio, garage workshop, post and beam barn, open pasture, citrus grove, vegetable garden and nature trails all support a dream of healthy, land-based self-sufficiency.  GYMNOS is on its way to becoming a small tribe that is on a return to life in harmony with nature, loving each other selflessly, sharing resources and ideas and living with freedom. We are also full-time naturists which means we live together without clothing at all times.  We expect to outgrow our five acres soon and are looking at relocation to a much larger rural land base in the near future.   For more detailed information check our website and blog posts.  At this time we are only welcoming visitors who are seriously interested in joining us.  An email dialog and subsequent phone conversation is essential.

      <name>Hollow's End Cooperative House</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21664&quot;&gt;Hollow's End Cooperative House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We aim to make home life more fun, efficient and economic while enjoying each others camaraderie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/hollows-end-neighborhood-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/hollows-end-neighborhood-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hollow's End is a cooperatively minded group house share in the Monadnock region of SW New Hampshire.  We enjoy a balance of female/male people and are currently looking for men to join us.  A couple might be possible too.  Someone who already knows and loves the area, as well as who is open to the right long term (3+ years) situation is preferred but we are most interested in the right fit for all of us.   
 
If you are interested and experienced in farming and/or permaculture, that would be a plus as there are dreams and space to create..land with decent soils for a committed knowledgeable person and a fair bit of water.  

Life is busy so we try to live by our dreams and goals but be realistic and flexible too.  
We do put a major emphasis on health- both in body and spirit- and love the country rural life and place we live.
We are a mix of ages, the youngest being 30, the oldest 65.  Currently 3F, 1M.  
Teaching science, property management, artistry, retired and volunteering are some of the things that describe us.  Also biking, hiking, flowers, crafts, making yogurt, helping our elders and friends, mushrooming, traveling, dancing... We strive to live an ecologically regenerative lifestyle.
Join current AM stretching and meditation practice or not...  Shared activities are likely to arise here and there as we get to know each other, have time and interest.  
We do share a weekly meal together - our food preferences are all over the map but healthy for each of us.  We also meet monthly to review what's working well for everyone and what might need to be discussed.  

We live in a lovely peaceful hollow where the skies are dark at night and coyotes &amp;amp; owls abound.  We share an old but updated house with 6 bedrooms, one being for guests.  We are fairly quiet and enjoy the serenity here.  
Our closest large town is Keene and the whole Monadnock region is lovely with woods, rolling hills, lakes, streams and of course the mountain itself.  

We aim to make home life more fun, efficient and economic while enjoying each others camaraderie.  We have a warm interactive habitat here- a Home as opposed to a place to live.   For the best fit, you should be fairly neat and clean, positive and open minded, a good communicator, and willing to compromise. Perhaps you are also a bit wise but still growing &amp;amp; learning :).  
We drink very little if any and do not use recreations drugs.  We value a positive outlook on life, little drama and open communication.  

Rooms range from $450-$550 and include gas and electricity.  We pitch in for firewood, telephone, wifi and chores.  Well behaved pets are negotiable.

We'd love to hear from you.... please share a little about yourself and what appeals most to you about this situation and what group living experience you have.

We seek to explore and practice this way of life through restorative justice, Nonviolent Communication, permaculture, trauma work, gift-economy, and the common holding of income, land, and resources. Besides engaging in community, we want to act for global systemic change. We seek to accomplish this by stewarding a larger culture of nonviolence around us to empower this possibility. We acknowledge this work will not be accomplished until every system on this planet is designed to fulfill and respond to the needs of All.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/milktopia/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/milktopia/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Vision Statement:

We strive to create a culture which acknowledges our interdependence, and that empowers all to live their deepest truth and stand up for our collective well-being. We long to hold one another accountable in embracing the challenge of living with integrity and nonviolence in the world. Our hope is to deepen our courage to transform patriarchy, capitalism, racism, and imperialism. We recognize the immensity of this work and seek to sustain one another in nourishing community and empower a worldview which honors the sacredness of all life. 

Description:

We are an intentional community with five permanent residents at the moment.  As a hub for inner and outer transformation we are focused on community-oriented projects both on the land and off-site. Our community members have a range of focus and passions from music, gardening, Nonviolent Communication facilitation, community building, animal care, group leadership and teal organizational development, mushroom cultivation, and Restorative Justice.

Golden Rule-Rainbow-Community
&amp;amp; Permaculture Demo-farm

On a small Island south-west of Bohol in the Philippines we are establishing a Community based on spiritual aspects.
At the same time we do self sustaining farming and follow permaculture principles on a lot of almost 1'700 sqm.
The lot has around 7 different sections containing:

1. Entrance, Rest House with basement, workshop, open- and deep-well
2. Forest Garden with composting area, compost toilet, outdoor shower, Bird cage, water storage and grow beds
3. Shaded Labyrinth garden and sweat lodge
4. Japanese Pond Garden
5. Rocky pits with Meditation Hall base for Geodesic Dome
6. (Earth-House/future project) Ditch with recognizable cliff side
7. Rocky Coral hill with different plant varieties

A small rest house of native style gives us shelter from moody weather. The climate is tropical, sometimes rainy but mostly warm.
A Solar-Island-System provides us with electricity and a deep well pump ensures us plenty of water with the small disadvantage of salinity. 
The farm is located on mostly flat alvar terain, approx 10m above sea level and about 1km away from the sea cliffs. 

Our rest house can accommodate people in 3 small rooms.
Currently there are 4 people, 1 cat, 4 dogs, 1 rabbit, fish and a few chickens living at the Rainbow Farm.
We are still open for new members and volunteers;
People with skills and sencitivity towards the surrounding as spiritual guides and practicioners are most welcome.

Coming here is for most people, which are not used to Asia a bit of a culture shock.
We are trying ourselves to find the balance between the local culture, other species of plants and the cultural background we come from. Sometimes it's necessary to look at things with less expectations to manage daily challenges in communication with locals.
Anyhow, we just like you to know that we take our spiritual path very serious, practice unselfish love in meditation and in our daily action. We testing our limits for example with diets and fastenings. Sure there are slight adjustments for everybody’s health situation included, because one have to be ready for certain steps.
Basically we walk the talk, and not just signpost the path and let the others walk it… (Aquarian Gospel 15:15)

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21696&quot;&gt;Good Roots Intentional Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Eco-education demonstration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/good-roots-intentional-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/good-roots-intentional-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are a young family (2 26 year olds with a 2 year old and 4 year old and one on the way) looking to connect with like-minded people. We hope to start a small community over the next few years with a system of unconditional love, support, and respect for all at its core. We want to reach out and help empower people to make changes in their lives along with building a support group for ourselves. We hope to inspire and directly help create new communities, and wish to better connect them to each other, furthering the web of support.

We are currently in the beginning stages of developing 40 acres in Dallas, Oregon with gardens, orchards and small shelters. We have started with close to an acre of vegetable production that we work by hand. We are planning on establishing a viable permaculture farm in the coming years to support the property and community. We also plan to add chickens for eggs, bees for honey and beeswax, and sheep for wool.

Female empowerment, especially through natural childbirth and midwifery is the other side of the vision. We believe that through real food and natural birth things can change. Children that are born peacefully into the world, raised with love, fed with food from the earth, and are instilled with values that make earth stewardship, cooperation, and hardwork priority will have the type of leadership, appreciation of the earth, and love for all that can make changes in the world.

We want to surround ourselves with open-minded freethinkers, who wish to actively work together in creating a better world for future generations. We are looking for people with experience or interests in natural building, permaculture, biodynamics, homesteading, renewable energy, as well as education/homeschooling (nature-based, waldorf-inspired, etc), natural parenting, midwifery, natural childbirth, organizing and outreach, and working towards living truly fulfilling/meaningful lives!

We are looking for driven individuals with different ideas for marketing, businesses, or projects branching from the farm to help support the property.  For example, growing and selling flowers, herbs and/or herbal products, and prepared vegetarian foods that can be sold at the markets that we are currently attending.  Along with adding those options to our forming CSA.  Other ideas might be to start a garden/farm/nature-centered, organic foods daycare program for the area.  Or Holding classes and events (natural building, gardening, cooking, yoga, self-sufficiency, etc) - We'd love to consider other ideas. 

Please contact us if you have any questions, would like more info, or want to develop an affiliation.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21698&quot;&gt;Common Treasury Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Organic farming collective working and living together to produce a majority of our own food, including meat, milk and produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/common-treasury-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/common-treasury-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Common Treasury Farm is certified organic (since 1993) and located 27 miles from the Pacific Ocean nestled in a small valley. Our farm lies along a year-round creek and is mostly surrounded by National Forest. The farm is 1 hour drive to any size-able town (Corvallis). We raise sheep, milking goats, pigs, chickens, a milking cow and several beef cows. The garden is an acre of assorted vegetable crops, an additional acre of blueberries, along with raspberries, strawberries and the wild blackberries. We have one larger (30' X 90') and one smaller greenhouse on the property for season extension. We maintain irrigation rights to our creek and irrigate both pastures and gardens.   We grow our own fiber flax and process our sheep fleeces for spinning.  We speak English and Spanish. We eat a wide assortment of food from vegetarian to dairy to farm raised meat. Accommodations include indoor private space, shared bathroom and kitchen, wood heat.  Email for first contact and then we will schedule a follow up phone chat. No drop ins. We are not a large community and have very complicated schedules to juggle farm and off-farm income, so as much lead time as possible is best for planning a visit. We charge $40 per person/ per day for food and the time it takes for us to show you the land and spend several hours discussing the possibility of living together.

We are a working farm. Please be mindful of that and leave dogs at home during your visit. Please understand that as we grow most of our own milk, meat and veggies, there are times of the year when we may not have time to play host or show you around. Also, please do next expect to come here and &quot;hang out&quot; or be on vacation. 

At present we are actively looking for a couple or several single individuals who already have experience in rural living, community life and agricultural endeavors. We currently have open housing spaces available for the right person(s). As this is a very rural area, and we are not income sharing, the situation lends itself to people with an established internet-based part time job or those who pursue seasonal work elsewhere. We are NOT interested in folks seeking to grow cannabis here!</description>

Fort Awesome is a micro intentional community.  Right now we exist in the form of a large three person apartment in Middletown, CT.  We hope to expand soon into the two other apartments located on the bottom floor of the three family house where we reside, and later to possibly purchase property.  Our home uses a highly structured environment in an attempt to create maximum efficiency with resources, excellent communication, and personal accountability.  Our values focus on environmental sustainability, consensus-based egalitarianism, non-traditional family structure, and the creation of a safe space.  Dan and Ari, the founding members, are queer-friendly, child-free, progressive, in our early 30's, geeky, largely freegan, academic, and we have a pet dove named Juniper.

PLEASE NOTE: The earliest we will be potentially seeking a new community member is Spring 2016, and our current third roommate has expressed an interest to stay here for a few years. We are unlikely to have vacancy in the interim. Please contact AriKubie if you're interested in scheduling a tour and interview.

Thanks!

&quot;I lived in this home for two years and was happy and comfortable from start to finish. The bedroom is spacious, well lit, and comfortable. There is ample storage space in the attic, and plenty of room in the kitchen and bathroom. Dan and Ari are fun, yet responsible, making them easy to live with. The apartment is large enough so you have a sense of privacy. It is not cramped. The house is clean and well-kept. The division of household chores is fair and clearly defined. I found it very easy to keep up with the simple chores and never felt burdened.&quot;

Most significantly we work to facilitate and inspire community building here locally and everywhere, because we are continually awed by the power and fun of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/dacha-project-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/dacha-project-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Dacha Project, founded in 2008, is a do-it-yourself, egalitarian and educational homestead. We are comprised of six friends and an extensive circle of supporters and community members. Situated on 16 acres in Finger Lakes region of New York, we have built an off-the-grid, earth-bermed, solar-passive house, powered by active solar and a diesel generator converted to run on waste vegetable oil. (We connected to the grid on 2014 but still use solar power) In addition, we built, or rather sculpted, a straw-bale cottage, planted a fruit and nut tree orchard, and are ever-expanding our gardens.  We are almost entirely owner built, with innovative designs for our energy, heating, water, waste and agriculture systems.  

We often invite the community in for tours, events and workshops. In the future we plan to expand our educational programming and more official artist/writing residencies, as well as internships and apprenticeships. Although, we are not looking for more permanent members at this time, any interested people are welcome to visit, to write us, to purpose projects, or to simply explore our website or keep up with us on Facebook  (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dacha-Project/72957687386?ref=hl).

Our overall aim is to live in conjunction with the land that supports us, to present alternatives to wasteful practices,  and to have ample time to follow various individual pursuits, be they micro-businesses, art, or anything else.  Most significantly we work to facilitate and inspire community building here locally and everywhere, because we are continually awed by the power and fun of collaboration.

We produce all of our own electricity and plan to heat our buildings using wood burning stoves and fireplaces , and we are in the process of establishing a garden , orchards , and vineyard where we will grow all of the vegetables we need for our own consumption , sale , and bartering.

Buildings are being constructed to achieve virtual 100% efficient use of energy (i.e. R40+ insulation in walls and roof).

All water used for drinking , household use , livestock , irrigation , and fire suppression is harvested from rainwater runoff and stored in large , elevated , above ground storage tanks.

Gardens , fruit orchards , vineyards , wild hog traps , and a variety of animals and poultry will be used to minimize the impact of runaway food prices and predicted future shortages.

Plans are underway and scheduled to implement a substantial number of diverse revenue generation projects with all residents sharing in the proceeds of these ventures , including the establishment of a &quot;Guest Ranch&quot; , and a &quot;Safe House&quot; that will include such activities as wild hog hunting &amp;amp; trapping , daily horse riding , ATV rides , fishing , cook-outs , hiking trails , farm chores , etc.

Excess food production will be donated to needy causes , sold , fed to livestock , and bartered for various goods and services from our neighbors.

We are in constant contact with the rest of the world using high speed internet access and mobile phones , while taking maximum advantage of our quiet , clean , and beautiful rural setting.

We make extensive use of the latest technology and products available to optimize our efficiency , comfort , and effectiveness.

Our members attend the churches of their choice throughout the surrounding community on an optional regular weekly basis , they participate in their favorite community service activities on a regular monthly basis , and they take part in other community activities as well - to ensure we remain an integral , valued , and welcome member of the surrounding communties.

In summary , we maximize our self-sufficiency and survivability while taking full advantage of what modern technology , materials , and the internet offers - while enjoying the many benefits , advantages and freedoms of our rural environment.</description>

Aldeas de Paz (ADP) is a sustainable NGO based in Santa Barbara de Samana, the dominican republic. ADP is independent from political, religious or business interests and maintains independence by completely funding and operating its programs with the practical and monetary contributions of volunteers. The community promotes the &quot;Culture of Peace&quot; through enriching cross-cultural exchange for people of all races and nationalities and practices voluntary community service where it provides additional opportunities in educational, recreational and environmental fields and assists its beneficiaries to develop their potential and improve their own lives. ADP Volunteer opportunities are truly the microcosm of a world where people join together giving priority to improving life for humanity and promoting a &quot;Culture of Peace&quot; as a practical way to both prevent and resolve conflict. Volunteers and interns are the driving force of our charity, both through their volunteering and through their financial contributions. A typical volunteer/intern needs to be enthusiastic, willing to learn, ready for a challenge, has a desire to take initiative and dedicates a lot of caring and passion to the position. Friendliness, care, commitment and patience are among important qualities. We welcome individual volunteers, families and groups regardless of age, experience or background. Volunteering with ADP is a great opportunity to work side by side with locals, learn new skills, study Spanish, and immerse oneself in the Latin and indigenous culture. You are interacting with the community, building relationships and making a positive impact.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21715&quot;&gt;Eco-Tribe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; See prior section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/eco-tribe/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/eco-tribe/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are located on 52 acres bounded by rivers and streams 17 miles due east of the center of Atlanta.
    The focus of community is the development of an attractive sustainable, repeatable, Eco-Village Business model to replace 75-80 percent of the &quot;external economy&quot; with an &quot;internal economy&quot; meeting the housing, energy, food, entertainment, and transportation needs of a population of approximately 80 individuals. 
    The plan is for a dedicated team of about twenty highly skilled farmers, cooks, builders and support staff to be committed to offering a &quot;product&quot; to about 60 renter customers called &quot;Quality of Life&quot; or more appropriately &quot;Quality of Experience&quot;.  That team over time become equity partners in the enterprise which is organized as a perpetual corporate institution and upon their &quot;retirement&quot; essentially sell their ownership to their replacement.  
    The plan is to offer an experience similar to living in a small village in the south of France.  Anyone who has spent time in Provence knows that this is perhaps the highest quality of life anywhere on the planet.  
The &quot;mission&quot; of this team is to compete with the Archer Daniel Midlands, Monsantos, and other multinationals and to create such an attractive economically viable, and essentially &quot;kick their asses&quot;! 
The Village provides a lease on demand automobile fleet, meets most of their energy needs through solar and passive house design principles.  The Village functions almost as an all inclusive resort for the renters who may work from home or hold conventional jobs.  The Village has support staff for laundry, cleaning, and personal services such as shipping and office services as well as picking up items from local stores.  There is a state of the art movie theater and library of books and dvds as well as access to a 2,400 square foot shop equipped for woodworking, metalworking and the latest CNC equipment.  
   The farming staff uses a mix of the latest and most appropriate farming methodologies including permaculture, aquaponics and the grass based methods of Salatin as well as conventional organic farming.  The farming focus is on Sustenance farming for the internal community as opposed to commercial farming.

***Update: We don't currently have any space available but are working on some exciting developments with other IC's and landowners in Colorado. Send us your email if you'd like to be updated when something comes available. 

A fun-loving and creative community of like-minded individuals who have all independently arrived at many of the same understandings of how important environment &amp; community is to be a healthy &amp; happy human being. Needless to say, commonplace modern society has not recognized nor embraced these fundamental principles. Instead it relies on default mechanisms &amp; serves the interests of select political &amp; economic powers, not the health &amp; success of each citizen nor our species as a whole. Simply put, we believe we can intentionally choose to do better -and we are. 

Our physical location at 8000 feet overlooks both Denver and Colorado Springs while still providing a quiet and peaceful setting to take-in and connect with nature.  

   It has become apparent to us that the awareness and embracing of Intentional Communities is likely the single greatest tool we have to ensure the success of both ourselves today and the future of humanity. It is the only apparent viable solution to replace the inherently flawed and deeply troubled political and economic systems that are being self-perpetuated without regard to nature, common sense, scientific findings, psychological &amp; health  implications and the will of the citizens. 

 There are many ideologies. movements and organizations from which we each draw our understanding &amp; inspiration. The following are just a few &amp; each one represents a wealth of information, as you know if you are familiar with them. If not, we would encourage you to research them to see if you can identify with the life changing and problem solving wisdom presented.

We have a comfortable rustic house with many bedrooms, wild edibles, tall trees and a salmon bearing creek singing along one border.  

We are building a new way of living, full of play, creativity, nature, and love.  Informed by the work of Charles Eisenstein and Jon Young (8 Shields), we are creating &quot;the more beautiful world our hearts know is possible,&quot;  a place we all belong, where we are each honored and connected. 

We are passionate about our food, and strive to choose organic (or better!) ingredients as much as possible.  We include both (local) meat eaters and vegetarians, and create both traditional foods (raw milk, kefir, kompucha, kimchee, coconut oil and healthy fats, organ meats, bone-broth soup) and brand-new receipes.  

We are fascinated by permaculture, primitive skills, non-violent communication (NVC), and alternative paradigms. We are passionate unschoolers, letting our children (and our adults!) choose their own paths and learn from their community and mentors. 

We like to cook together, eat together, work and play together.  We value privacy, and each adult or family has their own bedroom, but we greatly enjoy the community of sharing our common spaces together, and socializing, and learning from each other. While we value long term members, we also know that life is change, and we usually have a couple room openings every year.  

We often host community gatherings, so please email if you'd like to come visit us.  Please tell us about yourself when you do: what you are passionate about, what you want to do, what cool stories you might share!

We are part of Barefoot Village, a collection of local individuals and families. Barefoot Village gathers throughout the seasons to celebrate connection, share our gifts, and belong to a supportive community.</description>

We aim to relinquish non consensual power hierarchies created from our societal influences and build off of each other’s experience and background to better the earth, the cooperative and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/r-o-o-t-s/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/r-o-o-t-s/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Roots Cooperative

We are one of the 8 community cooperative here in Austin Texas. Our focus is on environmental sustainability and community building. We are governed through consensus process and highly value communication. Roots was founded by 10 activists out of the Occupy movement and takes a strong political and social stance for equality by gaining awareness of societal generated oppression and creating a new standard for non-hierarchical relationships.

We have a few raised bed gardens, a hugelmound, wicking beds and an aquaponics system. Cats, dogs, people, chickens and the occasional guinea fowl and turkey live here. We are renters who all have different hopes and dreams. Some of us wish to acquire land and some wish to integrate into other types of societies, cultures and cooperatives. Our current goal is to open up the passions of each other with the freedom of expression and allow each individual to blossom while creating a stronger blueprint of how a coop should walk and talk.

If you are interested in helping and are OK with primitive camping with facilities on-site, do get in contact with us because we would love the help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Bringing the intentional village and Primal skills together in one place for exceptional living and thriving in health, attitude, relationships and economy.

The primal Village will be an Intentional Community comprised of individuals and families who's main goal in life is to live life without depending on the rest of the world for survival or existence, who are aware and accepting of Polyamory (you don't need or have to be Polyamorous).

You will find that most of these people will be trying to live the four R's (Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). The reasons will be varied, some may live this life style because it is cost effective, others for the Planet, etc.

Members will most generally be interested in Alternative Energy production, Eliminating GMO foods from their diet, growing their own food (Wild Edibles, vegetables, meat, fruit), building their own Natural (locally obtainable natural resources) buildings/homes and many more similar ideas and lifestyles that result in not needing to buy anything.

If you are or know someone that might be interested in helping out with the formation and implementation of this project (planning, strategy, building, etc.), contact me.

We envision a world without oppression or hierarchy, where power is shared equally, and where all life is treated with dignity. We work to create this future by building housing alternatives that are equally accessible to all and that encourages the exploration of what it means to live in a beloved community. Our goal as a household is to create a cooperative and supportive home, where house members can develop, create and become whatever they desire in their self, alongside others and in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/la-casa-de-hueso/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/la-casa-de-hueso/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our home is a large two-story house (plus a very large basement) with 6 bedrooms (2 more in the basement), a large living room and dinning room, and kitchen. We have a large covered backspace (which is convenient for the rainy Olympia weather), a back garden space (that is used mostly for our grazing chickens), and a large front garden space (the chickens aren’t allowed here on account that they keep eating our sprouts!). We also have a large garage used for bike storage, maintenance projects, and roof access. We are all currently renters and do not own the space (something that we would love to change one day!).

We are located on the beautiful west side of Olympia. The house is in walking distance from down town and the west side Olympia Food Co-op and a short distance from The Evergreen State College. On clear days we even have a view of Mount Rainer from our top floor.

Our community consists of artists, activists, musicians, poets, workers, environmentalists, students, radicals, lovers, dreamers, and adventurers.</description>

2.  To create an inclusive environment that embraces our extended families and welcomes our friends.
3.  To create sustainable practices that embody our values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/rarebirds-housing-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/rarebirds-housing-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The RareBirds are a group of 6 investors currently comprising 3 couples and 2 single women in Kamloops, BC.  Together we have build a 6,000 square ft home on the edge of the downtown area.  We have about 1/2 acre of property that overlooks a gorge with an amazing view of the valley.  Our home is spacious with lots of natural light.  The common space has a large open space living, dining and kitchen area with a walk in pantry and access to 2 patio areas.  The lower floor has a multi-purpose room, a guest room and bath and a quiet room for meditation or yoga.  Private space consists of 6 bed sitting rooms with bath that range from 380 sq ft to 410 sq ft. each  2 units are on the main floor and 4 on the upper floor with a common area library and east facing deck.  We are multi generational and adult oriented, ranging in age from 50 to 73. Some members working full or part time and some are retired.  We currently have a dog in our family.  Cats are not an option because of pet allergies, but a second dog might be considered.
We are a busy active household.  Our members typically engage in outdoor and cultural activities, volunteer in the community and travel widely.
After 3 years of planning and 2 years of test driving,  we feel we are well on our way to living into our shared vision.</description>

The Living Energy Farm is a project to build a community, education center, and farm that demonstrates that a fulfilling life is possible without the use of any fossil fuel. Our mission is to serve as an example and actively promote lifestyles and technologies that are truly sustainable, and to make these sustainable technologies accessible to all persons regardless of their income or social position. 

LEF is a zero fossil fuel school and community. Our goal is to demonstrate that it is possible to live a healthy joyful life without the use of any fossil fuel, and to promote this lifestyle far and wide. 

We operate an organic farm that grows vegetable and grain seeds for income. We produce all of our own electricity with photovoltaics, and we run our tractors on woodgas, a low-grade biofuel. We heat our homes and cook our food with solar energy. We grow a large percentage of our own food, and preserve the harvest by drying and canning. 

We also host interns and volunteers in an educational program covering diverse areas of modern sustainable living, including organic gardening and orcharding, green building, solar water and space heating, solar electricity, woodgas, composting toilets, bicycle repair, and other subjects. Most importantly, LEF teachs about the importance of sustainable technology in context, about when and where such technologies are effective and when they are not. The most powerful sustainable “technology” we employ is cooperative living.</description>

The HAUS Project was formed in late 2010 to provide affordable, sustainable, cooperative housing in the accessible, urban core of the Houston region within close proximity of Houston’s growing light rail transit system. 

The first house, Rosalie, opened on January 1, 2011 in Midtown and now houses ten people in its ten rooms. We’ve since expanded to include a second 15 bedroom house on Ruth St.  We intend to develop houses of various sizes and appropriate for various lifestyle options, including at least one student focused house, and at least one house appropriate for children and families.

We are always looking for future members and are especially looking for people who are excited about being on the front lines of developing our next house.

The mission of HAUS Project is to:

Provide affordable housing operated cooperatively by residents.
Provide greener, more sustainable lifestyle options.
Educate the general public about cooperative organizational principles and greener, more sustainable lifestyle options.
Assist other cooperative and sustainable efforts in the Houston region and elsewhere.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21748&quot;&gt;Saba Cooperative at Seven Springs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Health and Wellness Cooperative focused on healthy mind, body, spirit, arts and permaculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/saba-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/saba-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
“Saba” is translated as “tomorrow” in the tongue of the native Abenaki people and this intentional community is planned according to the needs of tomorrow:  Wholistically creating peaceful, voluntary, sustainable alternatives to meeting human needs on physical, mental, spiritual and social levels. 

Saba is a social enterprise dedicated to assisting communities with integrating cooperative housing with complementary and alternative healthcare services as well as community education on permaculture, arts, and sustainable living practices.  

Saba's mission is to assist communities with goals to becoming ecologically and economically sustainable.  Saba’s projects include the utilization of local building materials and passive and active solar collection and storage systems for energy.  Further, in this bioregion, a significant concern for structures is heat retention during the cold season.  Saba's projects use the support of nature for this purpose using earth-sheltered structure designs for the community and living quarters, as well as in the design of greenhouses.  Saba’s goal is to promote harvesting and storage of rainwater through the use of specific drainage designs and water catchment systems as well as gray water recycling.

Saba's mission is to assist with the development of sustainable food systems that meet the community’s food needs while maintaining healthy ecosystems. Saba commits to the use of permaculture principles to promote regeneration of healthy ecological conditions not only for the current community, but for generations to come. Permaculture is based on working with, not against nature and promoting human dignity and health, animal welfare, social justice and environmental sustainability.  The anticipated application of the permaculture design integrates local plants, edible forest gardening, pasture-paddock chicken raising, proper utilization of all potential waste products such as with composting, biologically diverse polyculture herb and vegetable gardens, and the utilization of natural patterns found in nature in the gardens, greenhouses, and structures.</description>

We believe in open and honest dialogue and place a heavy emphasis on relationship building as a foundation to create a safe and inviting experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/fortunity/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/fortunity/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Please be aware we are currently restarting at the moment, seeking more core-committed or equity-invested members to proceed more effectively. 

fortunity reflects an urban community lifestyle based on a complex combination of residential, commercial, and rural properties with interwoven related projects. Our passion above and beyond living and working together is communication -- in many forms. Though we may tend towards lengthy and intensive planning discussions at times, the goal is to apply the results in productive fashion. Check out our website for more info, and to schedule a visit or tour if curious.

Please also note: we would best be defined as 'spiritual not religious', represent many different ideologies, dietary paths, and cultivate open minded but grounded and healthy lifestyle choices. Pets, addictions, and substance abuse are not welcome here, but responsible and conscious living definitely is.</description>

Isidore the Laborer (1070-1130), was a beloved Christian saint, known for his love to the poor and to the animals.  He is considered the patron saint of farmers, day laborers, and rural communities.  Our goal at St Isidore is to live together in community, supporting each other along life's journey, finding ways we can serve and help others in need.  Ideally we would share several  meals together throughout the week, and have a little bit of time each day for daily prayer.  We would like to start by buying a house in the city of Battle Creek, Michigan, with enough yard space to do some organic gardening. 

As of February, 2016, we are still looking for interested individuals.  It would be great if we could get going either in 2017 or 2018.

Please call or e-mail if you might be interested in joining.  We look forward to hearing from you!  You also might want to consider joining the Meet-up Group:  http://www.meetup.com/Battle-Creek-Intentional-Community-St-Isidore/

Bennett Fellowship is a unique leadership development program that trains, inspires, and sustains emerging women leaders committed to social justice. The program is available to five female/ woman-identifying post-undergraduate applicants.

For the duration of the program, fellows are empowered to explore the dynamics of social change, spirituality, and activism and are encouraged to discern their vocations within this context. Fellows gain practical experience engaging social justice and anti-oppression work through placements in community-based organizations in Nashville, as well as experience working on personal and group dynamics, conflict management, community building, and self-care.

The purpose of the program is to prepare young women to lead social justice movements and organizations with integrity and the capacity to engage oppression with intersectionality. The program also builds capacities necessary for women to articulate deep, personal conviction about their work and integrate self-care for sustainable, life-long leadership.

Each year, 5 participants are selected from around the country for this ten-month program.

Fellows are placed for ten-months with community-based organizations engaged in social justice and anti-oppression work at the local level, such as grassroots organizing groups and nonprofits. Each site placement identifies specific goals and outcomes for the fellows and provides the supervision and resources necessary to accomplish them.

Fellows also work as team assistants with Scarritt Bennett’s Education Office, connect one-one-one with a mentor, build community at the Center, and meet weekly for personal and professional development trainings.

Participants live together in an intentional community practicing a simple and sustainable lifestyle. Scarritt Bennett supports the well-being of each fellow throughout the program so that these young women will be able to dedicate their lives to the work of the program. For the allotted program length, each participant will receive housing with all utilities paid, full health insurance coverage, 40 hours of paid work per month at Scarritt Bennett Center, street or lot parking, and help in getting student loans deferred.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21779&quot;&gt;Providence Zen Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; residential Zen practice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/providence-zen-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/providence-zen-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Providence Zen Center is a residential spiritual community founded in 1972 by the Korean Zen Master Seung Sahn to provide a place where his students could live and practice Zen together.  In 1979 we moved to our current location about 20 minutes from the heart of Providence in rural Cumberland RI. 

Most residents work outside the community and pay a monthly training fee (currently $675).  This fee covers all primary living expenses (room, food, utilities).  Food is bought and shared by the community, and community meals are cooked for the community several times a week on a primarily volunteer basis.  The remainder of meals are prepared individually. Our spiritual practice is modeled after the practices of the Korean Zen tradition.  Zen meditation practice consisting of sitting meditation, chanting, and bowing is offered twice daily in the early morning and evening, and residents are encouraged to practice together daily as their work schedule permits.  In addition, residents may attend monthly weekend retreats as well as longer retreats held twice yearly in the summer and winter:  these retreats are available to residents at no additional cost.  We also have a large non-residential community which visits the center to attend practice, retreats, or other community events, and we offer our hospitality to other spiritual groups which rent our facilities to host their own retreats.  

As a community we are committed to working towards greater sustainability.  To this end we are transitioning to purchasing as much organic and local food as our budget allows, growing some of our own produce in the garden and greenhouse, and keeping chickens to help provide eggs for the community.  We have installed low watt florescent fixtures and bulbs throughout the buildings. We are also working to retrofit the buildings to make heating in the winter more energy efficient. Last fall we replaced the remaining single pane windows in the original wings of the building with energy star rated replacement windows. In addition to this, we work to foster greater connection with the wider spiritual community through participation in ecumenical and interfaith groups, and have hosted interfaith retreats.

      <name>Allegheny Crest Intentional Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21792&quot;&gt;Allegheny Crest Intentional Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Integrating community with the larger world; creating change *in* people that leads to critical social change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/allegheny-crest-intentional-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/allegheny-crest-intentional-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Allegheny Crest Intentional Village is a unique approach to combining social change, personal growth, rural revitalization, and ecological sensitivity.  Located in the West Virginia Potomac Highlands, 100 miles west of Washington DC, with spectacular mountain settings and crisp, clean air, our land currently includes a retreat center with 20 acres of lush, pristine river valley, and 3 acres of mountaintop with four houses, a 24-unit motel, and a general store.

Like many other intentional communities, Allegheny Crest is based in humanistic values, equality of opportunity, social action, personal growth, and compassionate service.  What makes us a village, and not only a community, is active outreach, local integration, radical acceptance, and porous membership:

Active Outreach:  We regularly have events that bring in a wide range of people, and these events change lives! Participants have said: “‘normal’ is not normal anymore”; “opening doors that I didn't even know existed”; “truly people who accepted me unconditionally”; “I fell in love with myself!”  (We jokingly say that we measure success by how many people go home and quit their jobs.)  Whatever skills you have can be used to help create these amazing spaces.  They make magic!

Local Integration: We reach out to those who already live nearby, providing services, working with them, playing with them, building connections in whatever ways work best, and becoming an integral part of the local people’s lives. 

Radical Acceptance.  People who would never think of discriminating on skin color or gender often unconsciously discriminate against people with different verbal styles, work patterns, thought processes, or priorities.  Discovering these blind spots and creating a welcoming environment for *all* people is a core part of our work in the world.

Porous Membership.  Many communities have a strong line between members and non-members, have strict limits on visitors, and a structured membership process—all within the context of defined property lines.  Membership at Allegheny Crest can take any form that human relationships can take, from client or casual acquaintance to event participant to short-term volunteer to full residential membership—and individuals can shift their relationship as their own needs and growth require.  Because we practice Radical Acceptance, this includes accepting that an individual’s relation to the community can change however it needs to without breaking that connection.  Porous membership allows people to connect in many ways that allow for mutual benefit for the person and the community.  This also spreads the community’s influence and connections much more widely.

We are also distinctive in our approach to governance and to abundance:

Compassionate Anarchy.  Rather than needing group approval for every initiative, each person has full authority to act on their own—and the responsibility to discern who will be affected and how to incorporate their concerns.  Compassionate anarchy fosters individual initiative, allows greater personal freedom, and replaces centralized control with a dynamic negotiation process.

Abundance.   Subsistence living is often seen as a value or necessity in community living.  We value and support abundance in every aspect of life: emotions, economics, energetics, social connections, personal freedom, and time.

If you are an independent-minded and energetic person who wants an intimate community while contributing to cutting-edge social change, you may find your home with us. 

Many of us have connected through New Culture experiences: workshops, open houses, weekend events, and ten-day summer camps. There are intentional communities and businesses across the country and beyond that have been built on New Culture insights; here, we are taking it to a new level.

Our existing businesses form the economic base for the village.  The work is quite varied, and includes every aspect of producing, managing, maintaining, and improving these businesses, properties, events, activism, and educational programs. 

Play and connection are also core and conscious activities; *balance* is a primary goal.

Members can select a living environment that best suits their needs:  resident on one of our properties, member of a group house, or living in a separate house or apartment that they rent or own.  Residents who choose to be part of the core economic base are provided with room and board (and medical care in many cases), as well as assistance in creating independent income opportunities.

Because there are no zoning restrictions and no building code restrictions, Allegheny Crest is an ideal location for using alternative construction techniques, land use, energy generation and management, sustainable design, and much more.  We already have a geothermal heating and cooling system for the motel, and geodesic domes for large group meeting spaces; we are excited about exploring other projects that move us more towards sustainability.</description>

We’re a group of people who view living in a community as something more than just being room-mates. We are looking for people – families or individuals who share our vision of co-creating a sustainable community home together.

We eat together and share in many of the household chores and expenses of living. Moreover, each house member is committed to raising his/her individual consciousness and, in doing so, developing the vitality, strength and intimacy of relationships among the whole group. Our purpose is to grow together, parent together and live together in laughter, joy and even in our suffering.

What we are offering is a system where each member participates in the communal responsibilities of the household
	Each member participates in one weekly house meeting where we dialogue about interpersonal relationships, resolve conflicts and take care of logistical matters	
        Each member takes care of the children of the house for 10 hours/month to promote a culture of healthy attachment and mentorship for children 
        Cooks or prepars a vegan meal once a week so that everyone can participate
	In addition to rent, pays an extra $180/month toward the grocery kitty, and $25 for a wear-and-tear fund 
        Takes on average two house chores a week 

Currently, there are two owners of the house who are still in the role of landlords and rent is paid to them for a room, gas, hydro and internet.

Some of the texts that have been helpful in guiding us in our endeavor are: “On Dialogue” by David Bohm, “Getting the Love You Want” by Harville Hendrix, “Concious Loving” by Gay and Kathlyn Hendricks, “The Anatomy of Peace” by the Arbinger Institute, “The Continuum Concept” by Jean Liedloff,  “Hold on to Your Kids” by Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Mate, “Free at Last” – the Sudbury Valley model of free and democratic education, the work of M. Scott Peck on community, the work of A.H. Almaas on spirituality and, most recently, “The Presence Process” by Michael Brown

(Please note: none of us are extremists and we haven’t all read these books – we share in our knowledge and practice with each other and respect the different paths each of us are on and the different ways each of us learn to come to higher levels of concsiousness and closeness with each other).

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21801&quot;&gt;Ekobius Ecovillage (Ecology Crossroads)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Through cooperation, peace and the natural world we can realize our genuine purpose as the caretakers of the planet. Our community is dedicated to the using appropriate ecological technology, natural materials, harnessing the energy of nature, and benefiting from its gifts. Our focus as a group is on ecosystem services, their protection, development and sharing for ourselves and future generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ekobius-ecology-crossroads/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ekobius-ecology-crossroads/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Come live in the Upper Amazon and Orinoco Mountains, on the Guiana Shield where it all began! 

It took us several years to find the right property and have overcome the invisible socio political factions that mysteriously exist trying to prevent our Indie-pendent Ideals. &quot;Now our property is finally paid off and we can begin moving in&quot; David Wright, Project Coordinator.

In May 2013 we entered into a contract to purchase property at the frontier edge where the Amazon Rainforest meets the Guiana Highlands, locally they call it Guayana, we call it the Amazon Highlands. We started using Ekobius (Ecology-By-Us) to describe the special niche ecosystem and area where we live and are building a prototype model ecological village based on open-source ideals. This is deep ecology and nature at its best!

As of October 2018 we are beginning a reformation ecovillage, installing our own idealist eco-permaculture and sustainable intentional community! For the first time since we began planning and purchase in 2013, the property can now be occupied and has finally been prepared well-enough to accommodate visitors and begin the development of our modern example eco-community.

Located in Venezuela's Northern Amazon; literally, at the 'End of the Road.' our property is the absolute last property that can be inhabited permanently by other than traditional indigenous peoples before entering a protected land area of 650,000 square kilometers full of indigenous reservations, natural monuments, national parks and biosphere reserves. Cross the river behind our property and the next contact with civilization you will find is a 100 day hike due south to the Amazon River or due east to Mt. Roraima and the Guyana, Venezuela, Brazil border. 

We are 33 kilometers (20 miles) from the capital of the state of Amazonas, Puerto Ayacucho, which is in the Atures municipal district. Our ecovillage is located on an asphalt connector road with the capital, we are located between the local community of La Culebra and the indigenous community called Gavilan at Kilometer 24 on Via Gavilan. Public bus transit is available within 10 kilometers of our property. The front of our property has 800 m of road frontage and nearly 2 km of frontage on the Catañiapo River.

Our project is owned and operated by the Ekobius International (an International Cooperative) who are the member residents of our eco-village (ecovillage) development. The property, its infrastructure, and its buildings are wholly owned and controlled by the cooperative under express indefinite permission with the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands. 

Anyone can become a member of Ekobius by investing in the socio-productive cooperative, anyone can further become a resident of our intentional community (ecovillage) and work in the cooperative by joining the cooperative and visiting us with a backpack or a suitcase.

We are seeking open minded people that consider themselves free and liberated of capitalism and the mainstream society. We are unifying ourselves differently than most communities because our common bond is not religious or political, spiritualist or governmental; our ideals are based on indigenous knowledge, enhancing nature and fostering the earth's ecology, instead of exploiting it. We are developing as a small ecological community dedicated to sustainable development and the enhancement of our natural environments. Taking care of the planet that takes care of us. 

Resident members can work in agroforestry, permaculture, teaching ecology, growing medicinal plants, making artisan products, developing handicrafts and through the social production of ecosystem services and non-wood forest resources through specialized educational development projects sponsored by international patrons in the Guiana Highlands and Northern Amazon regions. 

We embrace barter and the Pachamama (Mother Earth or Gaia) if that is considered a religious faith.

Resident cooperators are paid for their individual work production and cooperatively through the net production of the coop as well. The cooperative ownership assures fair trade practices. 

Our project is beginning with a property that has a common kitchen building, a four room lodge, a 5 stall bath house, several concrete foundations and 2 chicken coups.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21805&quot;&gt;Sadhana Forest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Reforestation, personal growth and water conservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sadhana-forest/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sadhana-forest/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our main project is the reforestation of 70 acres of severely eroded land. We are working to re- create the Tropical Dry Evergreen Forest indigenous to our area. This forest type is found only in Southern India and Sri Lanka and provides a rare biological richness due to its very high species abundance (over 1000 species of trees, shrubbery and liana). The Tropical Dry Evergreen Forest is now close to total extinction as only 0.01% survives. This is a last moment effort to keep this very rich and beautiful forest on earth. As part of our reforestation effort we are also working on water conservation and soil management.

Our projects include the work with local children, hosting many groups of people interested in conservation, the UniverCity of Compassion and an animal sanctuary where we care for rescued animals.

We practice an eco-friendly way of life including veganism, alternative construction, solar energy, biodegradable toiletries, and compost toilets
.
Volunteers mainly plant, mulch, and water trees during the season, work on water conservation in the forest and around the community, cook, clean, maintain the community area, and spend time with local and community kids.

Free facilities for volunteers include a small swimming pool, free 24/7 unlimited access to the Internet with your own device, four hours each day of AC power to charge electrical equipment, a small collection of books, the use of several bicycles, and a playground for children. There are also daily workshops offered that are run by our volunteers and vary each week and can be anything from yoga, to Capoeira, to non-violent communication, to arts and crafts, and much much more!

Food and accommodation:
- All meals (vegan) provided
- Accommodation provided
Accommodation for volunteers is in exchange for a 25 hour work week, 5 hours a day, 5 days a week.

This is a nonprofit ecological project that does not generate any income. Therefore, we cannot provide free food for volunteers. We have communal vegan organic meals. We all equally share the cost of the organic food ingredients we purchase. The total cost of food per person (including 3 meals a day) is 500 Indian Rupees per day (just under $8 USD).

This is a 100% vegan environment, so we ask volunteers not to bring or eat any non-vegan food in the forest. A vegan is a person who does not consume any animal products as food. Vegans do not eat meat, fish, eggs, dairy (milk) products, honey, or any other animal products. As vegans we aim to reduce animal suffering, move towards a more sustainable and rational use of land resources, and
reduce the high level of “greenhouse gases” produced by vast numbers of farm animals.</description>

This is a community in the planning stages here in the Tampico, Mexico area. We have a climate which permits year round organic gardening and wonderful solar and wind energy opportunities. I have begun and experimental earth bag cottage in my backyard which will combine recess, straw bale, and earth bottle construction as well. After this I will build a two bedroom cottage at the community site right alongside the Panuco river in the Sate of Veracruz Mexico. It is about 33kms. from the city where I live Tampico. I presently have a large organic garden, raise rabbits, chickens and Mario (Italian) the owner of the land has about 20 cows.

My dream is to have about 20 two bedroom homes of similar construction that folks could live on part-time or full time.
 My son is at this location,
I am in Rama, Saskatchewan, Canada I have a bedroom available for a person interested in visiting for a few months. We are starting plants and animals. 3 1/2 acres of quiet. A three bedroom cabin. All amenities. Furnished. $250 per month if able to work 6/hours daily 5 days per week.we are rolling. My son is here with me and helps a bit. He is a little autistic so needs understanding. We love God and our neighbour, which includes you so drop a line. Thanks.</description>

We currently house almost 50 residents in three houses. Our mission is to foster an economically, ecologically, and socially sustainable society by promoting the value of cooperation and diversity.  We were born in 2007, on Halloween.

Our houses, Helm's Deep, Woodlandia and Middle Earth are all walking distance to the IU-Bloomington campus as well as to the heart of downtown Bloomington. Middle Earth house is owned by our cooperative, while the other two properties are rented. We are a 501(c)3 nonprofit for low-income housing, so we keep all our rent expenses affordable. To accomplish this, we share expenses for food and utilities, driving costs down.

Our membership includes a range of undergraduate, graduate and non-students. We feel that a diverse membership enriches the coop, especially since we practice democratic decision-making at the house- and coop-level. Our coop is active in the local community, ranging from participation in the art and music scene, hosting events in collaboration with other organizations that align with our mission, and sharing our space with volunteer groups like Food Not Bombs.

We are a 3 year old community near Riverside, CA.  Area is suburban/rural mix.  Currently we are several people in one 4 bedroom house.  Houses coming to market for rent or sale are available for co-housing.  We have changed the name from &quot;Sunshine House of Healthy Living&quot; back to &quot;Recovery House for the Inner Child&quot;.  But the general theme is the same.

We focus especially on healthy, sustainable living and personal self-improvement.  Recently, our group has been emphasizing personal recovery work on inner child and codependency.  It has become encouraged for members to visit 12Step program meetings in the area such as ACA and CoDA.  If you are not familiar with them, you can visit www.adultchildren.org and www.coda.org.  That gives us a common language and experience to understand what it is when people are referring to healthy boundaries, working with our feelings, cross-talk, etc.

While not vegetarian, reduced meat is encouraged.  The yard theme is edible landscaping.  We strive for financial stability via conscientious work and business.  We are also open to advanced technology in conformance with our ethics.  Currently, we have no membership dues.  But there is rent, chores and a shared pantry.  At this time, we cannot accommodate workfare, i.e. people will need outside income.

Please see our website for a more in depth review of our philosophy and aims at kondoria.org.

The Mac House started in the summer of 2010 and currently has its third group of residential members.   The Mac House was created to serve both the people of Mount Auburn and the members of the intentional community.  

The intent of this community is a combination of a few purposes, however, the main purpose is to ultimately serve the neighborhood while also living a socially and environmentally responsible life.

The objective is to obtain residential members who are currently working in the not for profit sector because it shows they are dedicating their time giving back to society.  The house also provides affordable housing for these tenants while they live in a like-minded housing community.  This house, however, is not exclusively for people working in the not for profit and public service sector, it can be for anyone who truly has the heart to serve others living in a simple way.   This home also has a first floor that is 100% accessible to those with limited mobility.

CO-EMPOWERMENT ~ We share responsibility and leadership, each person making a significant contribution to the overall vision and activities of the community, with consensus decision-making wherever practical.
SACREDNESS ~ We deepen in our chosen spiritual paths, find our place within nature/the cosmos, commune together in spiritual brother-sisterhood, serve the greater good, and celebrate the deeper meanings, rhythms and passages of life.

ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY ~ We work toward ecological sustainability through permaculture landscaping, organic gardening, food preserving, wildcrafting, green construction methods, alternative energy production, supporting the local economy, and more.
ECONOMIC THRIVANCE ~ We seek individual and collective economic well-being, through stewardship of various enterprises, including our educational and guest programs and member-initiated cottage industries. We encourage economic self-responsibility and autonomy while celebrating expressions of interdependence as we share resources and simplify our lives, in gratitude for present moment abundance.

Would you like to live in a vegan/veggie community house in sunny Sarasota, Florida? It is currently a semi-furnished 3/4 bedroom and 2 bath home (I own) on small lot with a nice swimming pool (child-safe) and beautiful, newly-remodeled kitchen. Near bus-lines and shopping; 4 miles from beach. I live there and am a vegan single woman and have 2 kids (who are not living with me until next July). I am a writer and school teacher interested in radical ecopsychology, shamanism and sustainable living--i.e., organic urban community gardening, recycling, community veggie meals (preferably vegan, but we can compromise), non-violent communication, conserving energy, cooperative parenting, drum circles, phases of the moon, etc. All are welcome. Please contact me if interested.

Long to live in a community supporting a path of love, simple life and growth? 
I am looking for 2-3 people serious about spiritual growth and holistic living to form a healthy tribe around core values which include: 

-- No longer being alone in our efforts to evolve mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually
-- Sharing one or more regularly-scheduled meals per week
-- Having weekly house meetings to check in with members and discuss issues
-- Making decisions by consensus
-- Practicing non-violent communication
-- Living organically and loving the earth, leaving as small a footprint as possible
-- Maintaining a clean-air environment, free of household chemicals and fragrances
-- Valuing kindness as our religion and compassion as our doctrine
-- Revering all life as holy
-- Respecting diversity as a tool for healing and growth
-- Regarding health as sacred, in all mental, social and physical forms
-- Eating all or mostly raw foods, vegetarian foods, and organic foods. (No foods are specifically banned, but the idea is to form a community of people who honor their bodies and choose healthy options in whatever way that means to them.) 
-- Trusting that service is an expression of the divine and that freely giving does not diminish a person
-- Taking responsibility for your actions and how they impact others
-- Sharing all household tasks and meal prep on a rotating basis

Obviously, this will be a non-smoking household. 
People of all ages, gender, race, sexual orientation, and abilities welcome.
Pets will be negotiable with landlord and community, when formed. 
Goal is to keep costs at a maximum of $550 a month per person, to garden, and live as sustainably as possible.

Welcome to the domain of Mother Earth “Douceur et Harmonie”: a vegan, intentional and eco community.

We are looking for long-term and permanent residents and investors.

We are vegan community (Vivien, Bluette, Sylvain, volunteers, guests and visitors) living on 21 hectares of protected green forest and organic gardens. Situated in the eastern Pyrenees in the south of France. The house and gardens are on a ridge where you can see both the sun rise in the east and set in the west, the Mediterranean in the distance and have a great view of the sacred Canigou mountain of Catalonia. This area is famous for incredible fresh stream water, river swimming, natural hot baths, abundant local and Spanish produce, camping, hiking and great lighting. Generally everyone speaks french but Bluette is fluent in English. There is a plenty of wild edible herbs, vegetable and herb gardens, fruit trees and berry bushes. Food is usually organic fruits, veggies, herbs, nuts, fresh (non wheat) bread, brown rice, spices, oils, and fresh carrot juice. The water comes from a spring on the property and is delicious. A peaceful, calm, tranquil, inspiring and quiet environment where the focus has been “gentleness and harmony” since 1964 when Vivien first arrived. There is always something to do in the gardens and orchards or around the large house (9+ rooms). The Douceur et Harmonie property is owned by an association and is strictly vegan (no smoking, no alcohol, no meat or animal products) and keen on the ethical and loving treatment of animals. Hence, D et H has been the home of many vegetarian animals such a birds, geese, ducks, rabbits, roosters and chickens; however, carnivorous animals such as dogs and cats are not welcome due to their tendency to attack the above animals (this has happened in the past). If you have a very gentle vegan/vegetarian dog, that is a different story. Solar heated water, solar ovens, and spring water swimming pool. Water source is the spring on the land. The traditional stone(huge)farm house is over 250 years old. We are interested in hosting Permaculture Design Courses and integrating more permaculture principles and techniques - including natural building design. A great place for writers, mucisians, aritists, or the average person who desires to get their creatvie juices flowing.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21843&quot;&gt;Cinderland Eco Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our vision is a world where everyone lives in ecological harmony. We believe in sustainable, responsible agriculture, like making sure to replenish the soil, saying no to crossbred GMOs, and living in harmony with our animal brethren as well.


Jezus’s mission is to build an eco friendly, self sustaining community starting from barren land and minimal funding. Starting with land, a dream, and many compassionate helping hands, we’ve learned as we progressed and are proud to be an example of how anyone can build a eco-friendly village or homestead like ours.

The main goal is to be completely off the grid, growing all our own food, with complete independence from the modern worlds support. We want to start from nothing and reach complete sustainability with only 20 years of perseverance to do it; and by golly we’re almost there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/cinderland-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/cinderland-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Cinderland is an ecovillage located in a beautiful, jungle-like landscape on the Big Island of Hawai'i. About 20 miles southeast of Hilo, and about 2 miles from the easternmost tip of the island, just a mile and a half from the coastline it lies. We are a community building a life founded on self-sustainability, organic gardening and permaculture. We share the dream of a simple, healthy, natural way of life.

We are minutes away from the black sands beach, tide pools, volcano steam vents, warm ponds, Green Lake, &quot;ecstatic dance&quot;, health food store and many farmer's markets, and neighbors ready to trade produce just around the corner on Papaya Farms Road. 

Residents and neighbors gather in our kitchen for shared meals on our infamous Taco Tuesday potluck, and various other shindigs and drum jams. Our community kitchen also features an in ground fire pit, piano, and bunk beds. 

All of our residents are at home in an all-you-can-eat buffet, you can eat whatever you like that grows on the land, we will teach you how to harvest sustainably and trade with the neighbors to keep the cycle going too. The gardens, greenhouse, solar oven, and solar dehydrator are also free for use to anyone who wants to learn. 

We welcome people of all backgrounds and nationalities, particularly those that are open, love the earth and are committed to its preservation. 



Come see what we're about, we would love to have you here,  
Mahalo!</description>

      <name>1st Amazon Ecovillage | Guayana Peace Trail Project</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21845&quot;&gt;1st Amazon Ecovillage | Guayana Peace Trail Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Establish an indigenous modern way of life that is in accordance with nature using appropriate technology and all that we exemplify as humans in our natural state on earth as good people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/1st-intl-model-life-change-ecovillage-and-pioneer-settlement-project/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/1st-intl-model-life-change-ecovillage-and-pioneer-settlement-project/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We learned see the world differently by living in the Amazon's Highlands, now you can too! Want to become an ecologically sustainable person? Can you live in harmony with our natural world? Can you live like an indigenous Amerindian? Perhaps a bit better if you apply some technology, practical application and utilize your theoretical ideals.

We began our journey down the road to life (our new way) in 2007 to establish a better way (a new natural ecoculture), because we discovered that the life course we had been taking was not the right path to lead us where we need to be in order to establish a harmonious existence as co-inhabitants of the planet.

Everyone should want to consider themselves good, peaceful, compassionate and knowledgeable human beings. We realized our purpose as co-inhabitants of the planet is a socially responsible one. We are finally as of August 2013 we began to realize that dream with two base properties here in South America.

The two properties are approximately 700 kilometers (435 miles) apart that's if you were a bird. If you walk (hike or backpack) the two locations are nearly 1000 km apart (600 miles) the hike can take from 50 days to 3 months, if you take time to appreciate the beauty it could also take 6 months or even a year if you make friends along the way or decide to take time to study, do conservation work, contemplate your world, or just stop along the way to live for a while. 

Our initial project was developed to become independent of property ownership however we discovered that people (government, authorities, indigenous neighbors) would not permit our peaceful coexistence as nomads or settlers in their territories without being one of them or allied with in their consciousness and world view. So now we have two base locations and the entire Guiana Shield and Amazon as our backyard.

Imagine an indigenous native American (Amerindian) village hybridized with a modern campground facility built using selected appropriate technologies incorporating alternative energy sources to produce abundant organic foods, enjoy modern showers, a clear cold water swimming pond, individual and group cabins, that all comes together at a grand central complex where residents and visitors can gather in a central garden lodge, eat meals in a communal kitchen and involve themselves in community group projects while taking advantage of a modern research station and ecological study center with WiFi Internet access beside a public school facility for residents which doubles as a movie theater, workshop and meeting forum for residents and visitors in the evenings.

Our dream project is just beginning and is constantly changing, its likely we will be in construction stages. They started on March 03, 2014 at Ekobius and will be working on the development in practice now before the cooperative charter on December 31, 2016. People with ideas that can support and tolerate (enjoy) this lifestyle should come and share them and implement them here with us!</description>

LEAPNOW is a community devoted to wholeness-based education and conscious living for all ages. Our 10-acre residential community with 10 residents (called Maacama) is 90 miles north of San Francisco in Sonoma County's wine country.  LEAPNOW runs soul-centered education programs for ages 17 and up that combine international immersion, college credit, conscious community and language study.  Our LEAPYEAR program is a full academic year long and is devoted to inner exploration and world travel. LEAPYEAR2 builds on the first year program and teaches the facilitation of transformative education.   Body Visible/Body Invisible (BVBI) is a year-long training in authentic movement.   During retreats on our land, students learn conscious living skills and create conscious community, engage in rites of passage, and learn to cook, bake, build, and create. LEAPNOW is devoted to empowering students of all ages to &quot;be the change&quot; they wish to see in the world.

We will be purchasing land in Central Eastern Texas. All members must be vegetarian or vegan, and committed to the gradual development of sustainability and simpler lifestyles in practical ways. Intoxication, including alcohol, is not allowed. 

Modern conveniences are acceptable in moderation, and as we gradually gain experience in natural lifestyles less &quot;conveniences&quot; become necessary. 

The residential portion of the community will consist of individually-owned households on 1 or 1.5 acres each, grouped into villages of 8 households, with a village common area in the center. Each household's land is around the village, like the spokes of a wheel. Land should be productively used, for personal use or for barter within the community. Everyone must grow some percentage of their food. 

Stabilized compressed earth block is our first choice in construction method, second is Earthbag. Electricity and water are available via rainwater harvesting and solar panels within each household. A well will be dug in each village, for agricultural use. The community lake is for recreational and aesthetic purposes, but the water can be used in time of emergency. 

Governance will be by consensus at the village level and the community level. The community will have broader rules, and each village may have more specific rules according to the resident's own choosing, within the parameters of the community rules.

The goal of Oak Forest is to create a collaborative that focus's on personal creativity,growing organic food,and developing marketable products to sell at area farmers markets and craft-shows.The intention is to create affordable housing that will foster personal enjoyment of area,a exchange of creative ideas,and hopefully a sense of community.Well,I should say the house incorporates many energy effecient and saftey systems.Saftey first, each room has a fire sprinkler and a monitored,hard wired smoke alarm.Additionally there are monitored smoke/carbon detection monitors in the hallways.Beyound that, the house was designed using the Home Energy Rating System or HERS,that increases energy effeciency up to 50% through use of increased insulation and energy effecient windows and doors.The house will be heated by natural gas and a outdoor energy effecient/low emmision wood fired water boiler .So the plan is to have  tenant spaces.The price range is from  rooms to go for $550{including heat,hot water,wi-fi,cable TV}to $625.Beyond that, oh boy.The house itself is on 40 acres of land,however, it's surrounded by Nature Conservancy, State land, so it's extemely rural.Beyond that it's on a limited access road, with further dedicated nature trails, a large brook.Beyond that, Lyme itself is a paradise.Through zoning laws they have kept the population very low and aggresively purchased land for nature preserves.As a result, it's like stepping back into the 1850's.You can bike for miles on country roads, very little vehicular traffic.On the weekends you can go two days without seeing another human face with little planning.Nature in the raw.I find it's a very effective way to unwind, get away from the rat-race, and get in touch with yourself and your projects.Nature is so begnin, a force for good,to just immerse yourself in it.We are up and running.

You wake up with the sun hitting your face from through the hull window of our boat. You take a look at everything around you and feel a sense of pride for all the hard work we have put into creating what we have. You feel great honor to know you belong to something so awesome and different. You spend a few hours each day doing some chores or sailing our vessel. Visit some distant and remote islands to look for coconuts, pineapples, mangoes and bananas or hunt for some wild boar or dive for lobster. Lounge on the beach, play some volleyball, dive on a reef and swim around or head back to the boat to relax and take a shower. Play some guitar and sit around a bonfire drinking some homemade coconut/mango/pineapple rum. Sharing stories of our awesome adventures and travels together, gazing at the stars, the fire and the ocean... you get this amazing feeling of accomplishment, unity, peace. Your mind is clear, you feel complete, you're here with us, in this moment, in-tune with yourself, your surroundings, the world, the whole universe. Welcome to SV Oikos.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21865&quot;&gt;Wyomanock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to grow a community that values and cultivates a supportive network of friends, who would like to engage in farm-based sustainable lifestyle practices, and who strive to reduce their carbon footprint as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/wyomanock/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/wyomanock/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hello!  Our vision is to establish an intentional community on 74 acres of land that we own in the upper Taconic Valley of New York, just west of the the Berkshire/Taconic range.  The land has a mix of fertile fields, ponds, streams, meadows, wetlands and forest.  We are not far from cultural centers and small cities including Pittsfield and the Berkshire region.  Our space is home to Wyomanock Farm and Wyomanock Center for Sustainable Living.  

Wyomanock Farm cultivates three quarters of an acre of organically grown vegetables, raises a flock of about 100 free range laying hens (on pasture and fed organic, local grain), and has a small herd of Scottish Highland Cattle for beef production.  We enjoy producing as much of our own food as possible.  In 2014, we established a small on-site farm stand which is open year-round.  With additional help on the farm, we'd like to attend local farmers markets and develop local or regional wholesale markets. 

Wyomanock Center for Sustainable Living was founded in 2010.  It is a nonprofit educational organization dedicated to increasing public understanding of sustainable living through experiential learning opportunities. We work with individuals, groups, and the community to encourage sustainability by fostering an appreciation of the natural environment; by demonstrating organic agriculture, renewable energy, and natural building; and by encouraging a locally-based economy and healthy, culturally rich community.  Since its inception, Wyomanock Center has offered events, farm and nature based educational workshops, regular monthly potlucks, a solstice celebration, film viewings on our focus topics, assisting with the development of a community garden in a nearby urban area, and solar shower community construction project.

We are looking for others with similar values and ambitions, including a desire to live simply, people who continuously work to incorporate sustainable practices into their lifestyle, and who have a desire to be a part of the Farm and Center in some capacity.  We welcome people of any age, ethnic and religious background, sexual orientation, gender identity, and dietary philosophies/needs.

A little background:  Thom purchased the land in 2002, started living here full time in 2003 with his two young sons, and began developing the Farm and Center in 2010.  Julie met Thom in 2012 at a local farming conference and moved to the land in late 2013.  Since that time, we have been working to further develop the Farm, Center, and Intentional Community.  Over the past few years we have had several individuals live here for varying lengths of time and with varied levels of involvement in the work we are doing.  At this moment, it's just us two!</description>

In 2015 we completed our subdivision process and sold 5 3-acre lots within the ecovillage to like-minded friends into personal growth and sustainability.  The community owns a 10 acre parcel in the back of the subdivision.  We started building in 2016.  We now have a beautiful dance/yoga/multipurpose space with an 1800 sq. ft. wooden dance floor as well as dining for 60, a glorious wood-fired hot tub, tons of food from the land such as: papayas, mangos, avocados, bananas, and many other exotic fruits.  

The vision is for the Lolia Community LLC to own title to the property and lease the land to the Lolia Foundation which will run the center and host courses and events that support our values.  We invite wwoofers and interns to join us and have an extended opportunity to live the practices of conscious sensuality and permaculture on a daily basis.

We are located near Kehena Beach, a clothing optional black sand beach and is an awesome place for yoga, swimming, snorkeling, and often frequented by dolphins who love to swim with people.  We are a 20 minute drive from our local town of Pahoa and 45 minutes from the city of Hilo and the airport.  The biking along the Puna coast on the red road is wonderful.
  
We share space so there is an opportunity to realize our true nature in the reflection of others.  There is plenty of space in nature around here for times of solitude, reflection and grounding.  There is also time to make money working in or outside the community.

We host the annual Hawaii Tantra Festival, Conscious Sensuality courses and many other events.</description>

We are a community of artists, ecologists and students. We live together for the enjoyment of community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sushi-tribe/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sushi-tribe/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Co-op with mostly college aged individuals, but also with older adults and children running around. We are a group of musicians, artists, students, spiritual seekers, and farmers brought together by interests in communal living, sustainable practices and fun loving vibes. We like to party, but not excessively. We also appreciate various spiritual practices and hard work on important causes and projects.

The house has been active since 2007.  The community began developing through a weekly gathering 3 years prior, with no community house intended.  For our first 5 years, our &quot;Alternative Library&quot; made the house a public space.  The &quot;Alt Lib&quot; has sense found it's permanent location nearby.  Other projects which have originated from our house include the B-Ham Friday Food Not Bombs, which feeds free vegan meals downtown weekly, and Bellingahm Body Rights (BodyRights.INFO), which organizes our local naked bike ride (BellinghamNakedBikeRide.com) among other body-positive campaigns. We have a healing room with tinctures, a massage table, and meditation/reiki space. We have a jam room with various musical instruments. Located in the center of town, easy biking distance to the ocean, university, downtown, and mountains!

We are open to hosting respectful and fun travelers for up to 5 days in exchange for work-trade, pending they have a host within the house.  Contact us if you would like to visit.  Membership and other requests are decided at house meetings, every Sunday at 7pm (8pm in summer).  Meetings are open to the public, and a great way to meet us!  Also ask us about events we have planned for the near future.  We would love to see you!!

Indigene Community is based in providing organizing tools in the 'indigenous' (Latin 'self-generating') 'economy' (Greek 'oikos' = 'home' + 'namein' = 'care-&amp;-nurture') tradition for people right where they live. Our planning is for people cataloguing, exchanging, using &amp; accounting for their talents, goods, services in a Community Investment &amp; Exchange System. CIES  called 'Do-we-know-who-we-are-?'. Our web-programmers are developing Open-Source software for our online web-based Human Resource Catalogue HRC Resource Mapping &amp; accounting for economic transactions in a Community Investment &amp; Exchange System CIES. We work with a community value called a 'Mem' (as 'memory' for all community contributions), which is based on an hour of work at Quebec minimum-wage. As a system of progressive ownership folks develop ownership in the CIES with their participatory contributions into Founder, Worker, Supplier or Consumer Associations. https://sites.google.com/site/indigenecommunity/structure/9-do-we-know-who-we-are

70% of people live in multihome dwelling complexes (Longhouse/apartment, Pueblo/townhouse &amp; Kanata/village) with an average of 32 dwellings for about 100 people. 100 people is the critical mass all humanity's worldwide indigenous ancestors sought. 100 people provides economies of scale for self-generating economies around food, shelter, clothing, warmth &amp; health when combined with the worldwide use in Production-Society/Guilds indigenous (string-shell) time-based progressive ownership accounting. RELATIONAL ECONOMY section of our website provides a humber of pages on different aspects of indigenous multistakeholder participatory economic accounting. https://sites.google.com/site/indigenecommunity/relational-economy

'Indigene' (Latin = 'self-generating') Tiohtiake 'Community' (L = 'com' = 'together' + 'munus' = 'gift or service')
LaSalle-Gardens Mutual Aid Committee function.  Individuals interested in working with us gain better idea from communication &amp; involvement in our ecological, environmental, elemental, economic, ergonomic &amp; engineering enhancement projects with multifamily (apartment &amp; townhouse) housing development.  We're working together to establish urban based ecological community in the greater Montreal region called Tiohtiake ('place where the nations &amp; their rivers unite &amp; divide') in Mohawk.

We're inspired by humanity's universal indigenous traditions based in multi-family planning, accounting recognition for all labour inputs through 'Production Societies' (Guild-like organisations involving progressive ownership from youth to elder involvement).  We're planning for ecological design with sun &amp; other elements, ergonomic with the human body &amp; economic with participant livelihood well-being. We expect to build safe, healthy fire resistant self-sufficient buildings with green-roof, precipitation gathering, urine-fecal separating green humanure toilets, grey water recycling etc. Our internal structuring involves both 'Consensus' ('reaching for common values' and respecting 'common interest') &amp; 'Caucusing' (Iroquois = 'grouping of like interests' or 'cultivation of diversity') among multi-stakeholder Founders, Workers, Suppliers &amp; Consumers.  A Human Resource Catalogue facilitates participation among intentional members &amp; larger community.  We expect to work within existing economic structures &amp; help them work sustainably.

We work contractually (written agreements), by accounting for contributions at market rates each individual developing credits.  Every transaction involves investment through Production Societies. Individuals develop equity ownership (charged at market rates) in condominium units as well as being given the opportunity &amp; accounting recognition for participation in commmon area functions.  Our target is to have approximately 100 individuals (35 households)living adjacent (private &amp; independent 'partements' at market costs)with opportunities &amp; accounting recognition to contribute to common area functions &amp;

Realizing that these guidelines rely on inspiration rather than rules:
  In order to truly love and live peacefully, we are willing to recognize and relinquish all fear-driven beliefs, judgments and separate needs, supporting each other in this process.  We recognize that healing occurs through forgiveness we manifest daily.  We experience the simple joy &amp; laughter that community offers, living simply as a means to this end.  We choose to participate in and develop a sustainable lifestyle, composting, gardening, conserving electricity, water, fuel and other resources.
  We commit to working as needed on household chores at least 5 hours each week.  There is no alcohol consumption or illegal drug use in the house.  Rent is paid monthly, up front.  The food receipts are split at the end of the month.  Food is shared by all members, taking into account individual preferences.  Group meals are encouraged, those not cooking are encouraged to clean up.  Decisions are reached by consensus at weekly meetings (see below); participation is expected. 
  Consensus - With respect for the views of all, we work to find solutions as a group for the good of the group.  No one is wrong.  We continue to examine all concerns until agreement is reached.
  We hold weekly dinners, monthly movie nights and facilitate ACIM classes at the Peace-atorium, inviting the larger community to join us.  We have sponsored a permaculture design course from April-July 2012. Check the Events Calendar on this web site or contact us for details and dates.

      <name>Oakland Morehouse</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21901&quot;&gt;Oakland Morehouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; conscious pleasurable living&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/oakland-morehouse/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/oakland-morehouse/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Oakland Morehouse, aka the Institute of Human Abilities, is the first Morehouse. Our doors have been open as an intentional community since the winter of 1969.

We are a mix of people with differing ages, races and socio/economic backgrounds living in a 100+ year-old purple Victorian in the Lake Merritt area of Oakland. Sometimes we eat together, sometimes we work together on the house, and we generally take care of each other and have fun. We are dedicated to a lifestyle of doing only what we want to do, while being mindful of our responsibilities and our impact on others. We call this &quot;responsible hedonism&quot;.

“Our philosophy is based on the belief that you are perfect, that the world is perfect, and that you are totally responsible for your life. We believe that perfection includes the potential for change.” By permission from the Lafayette Morehouse website

Our egalitarian social system is based the concept of “one no-vote”. In this system every individual has the right to cast an irrevocable no-vote, which permanently vetoes any proposed action. The effect of any disgruntled person having the ability to permanently stop forward motion on a particular course of action has resulted in a great deal of communication and very few no-votes cast. This system of decision-making fosters a level of consideration for the concerns of others and achieving high levels of agreement, which has allowed our group to stay together for many decades – much longer than the average “commune.”

We have weekly house meetings that average about an hour in length. While we don’t have regularly shared meals, there is a dinner available most nights. Each house member also has six hours of shifts a week, during which they can have their attention on the well–being of the physical house and the people in it. 
 

If you want to know more about our unique style of communal living, you are welcome to attend one of our parties or a group. We also contract from Lafayette Morehouse courses in which our philosophy and lifestyle are described in more depth. These courses address group living and critical aspects of human interaction, including, sensuality, communication and man/woman relationships.

There is usually space in our house for enthusiastic participants who want to have more pleasure and consciousness in their lives and who are interested in exploring the More philosophy. For more information on Morehouse go to www.lafayettemorehouse.com.

A semi-rural ecovillage-in-the-making on ten acres of beautiful Northern California land, one mile out of the town of Laytonville. Ten acres have been subdivided into four parcels which allows for the development of new green homes and community space. We partner with the Solar Living Institute (solarliving.org) to host workshops in sustainability.

The vision is to create an &quot;intentional neighborhood&quot; where people live in private homes, next to neighbors they want to live with, and with whom they share community gardens and community structures. One of the goals is to create a &quot;net zero energy&quot; community.

Unlike a lot of rural homesteads, we're walking distance from town, which lowers our carbon footprint and allows us to be more self-sufficient. Ten acres offers abundant space for agriculture, housing, and workshop space. Cultural diversity and the arts are priorities. Work trade and Internship opportunities start in the Spring. See website for details.

Portland is amazing community, and we are excited to build even better neighborhoods! Portland has year-round farmers markets, a walkable downtown, a great music and arts scene, dozens of participatory sports leagues, and a strong ethic of local food, local business, and healthy living!  
We are re-forming right now, and have people interested in both urban and rural models.

&quot;Living in the rhythm of blessed abundance!&quot;

SongCroft is on three acres just outside of the small town of Snohomish, Washington (population 8,500). We are one hour from the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. Half of the land is left to its wild ways with a creek, hemlocks and cedar with plenty of wildlife to observe. Our focus is on permaculture and sustainable living. We have gardens, a greenhouse,orchard, and chickens, ducks, rabbits, goats, bees, dogs, and a cat. 

We would like to share a meal a week, purchase bulk foods together, share in the garden work and harvest as well as other care of the land. We are a farm community and are interested in others who are of an agrarian nature.

Our community is currently full but it looks like we will have an opening soon.  We are currently working on a new dwelling that would be suitable for one to two people. 

We would also love to connect and build community with others in our area. 

If you have an interest in finding out more, please email. 

We are currently merging and revamping our website to see more of what we are up to and into and then give us a call or drop us a line.

We focus on building a more sustainable and just world, and strive to create safer spaces in our cooperative homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/plankton-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/plankton-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Nickel City Housing Cooperative is part of the NASCO Community of Cooperatives. NCHC has two houses: Ol'Wondermoth, founded in 2001, and Plankton House, founded in 2006. Our food is local, CSA bought, or grown ourselves. The houses are full of artists, cyclists, world travelers, couch surfers, animals, and generally pretty cool people. We govern as a house, as a housing co-op, and as a cooperative of cooperatives (NASCO). Both houses strive to be strong members of Buffalo's communities, and host everything from music shows to community meetings, with potlucks happening every week at each house.

Both houses are often looking for new members to drive our vision forward to new cooperative and community endeavors. Come do your thing in Buffalo! It's a low-income town with style and snow to spare! We've got beautiful summers full of water activities, festivals, farmers markets and free concerts! DIY-friendly! Bike-friendly! Vegan-friendly! Pet-friendly! Lots of room to dream!

Dreaming of a world where the things we love about each other makes us better people and helps create something bigger.

WELCOME HOME!

See our community classified titled
Blueberry is an urban farming collective house within an organic cohousing community in Portland, Oregon. Four sets of friends bought houses on the same block, three in a row and one across the street. We love the unintentional community of our neighborhood, friendly, diverse, and mostly low-income,  with small houses on large lots and a “country” feel. We have work parties, neighborhood potlucks, and parties for the larger community.

Some of us have lived rurally before and maintain as much of the rural life as we can, but an urban life allows us to be less car-dependent, and some of us are completely car-free.

We share passion for our land, our neighborhood, social justice, and sustainability. All of us grow enough vegetables to eat well and still give some away. At Blueberry we heat with wood, generate almost no trash or recycling, eat primarily local, organic whole foods, have no TV, and commute by bicycle. All of us have jobs and lives “off the farm”—we are musicians, teachers, bike mechanics, activists, etc. A few of us embrace spirit and ritual, others choose not to. We value tolerance, diversity, and listening.

Each household has its own internal structure. Blueberry has set a clear intention to transition to cooperative ownership.

As we are an urban community, we are not able to house dogs - they tend to dig up garden beds and scare the ducks.  Guide dogs will be considered.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21926&quot;&gt;Living Well Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Sustainability, Wellness, Local Food, Neighborhood self-reliance, Community, Green Building, Environmental Conservation, Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/living-well-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/living-well-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
The Living Well Community is a mixed-use community/ecovillage focused on health/wellness, sustainability, service to the greater good,  and honoring  the sacred. 

This is a 124-acre property bordered by a mile of frontage on the Deep River on one side and almost a mile of frontage on Sandy Creek on the other side. 

   The community has a combination of private and shared spaces with additional mixed-uses under development including green businesses, an integrative health center, an organic farm, a community garden, a neighborhood park and orchard, and 53 acres of natural area buffering the creek and river.

   The property is beautiful with mountain-like topography, the river, rock outcroppings, high areas with vistas, the creek, trails, beautiful woods, and abundant wild edible and medicinal plants.   

Our community is located near major highway corridors, just two miles from Highway 64 in the town of Franklinville, North Carolina. This property has regional appeal and access, being only a half-hour from Greensboro, 15 minutes from Asheboro and Siler City, and an hour and 15 minutes from RTP (Research Triangle Park), Raleigh, Durham, and Charlotte. We are centrally located between the mountains and ocean, and at the midpoint on the eastern seaboard between New York and Florida.  We are also approximately a 6 hour drive from Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, Georgia.  



The Conference and Retreat Center, located on the 50-foot-high bluff overlooking Sandy Creek and the Deep River, features the lovely, historic McIver-Faulk House, built in the 1850s and relocated to this site in 2004. The partially completed Conference and Retreat Center will be available for retreats, classes, and events (weddings, reunions, etc.).

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21953&quot;&gt;Adawehi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To discover and share health for oneself and the planet by addressing whichever area of health—body, mind, spirit, or emotions—that you need to strengthen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/adawehi/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/adawehi/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The 125-acre Adawehi campus is the home of around 50 people. It is a community of individuals who are raising their consciousness by releasing patterns that keep them from acting, thinking, and/or feeling the vibrancy of health. While each individual will have their particular focus, support of health is always the theme in all ten community houses. New homes are under construction to give more people an opportunity to join. 

The population of the community is a multi-racial mix of old and young, singles, couples, and families. While everyone is expected to contribute in maintaining the Adawehi buildings, grounds, and activities, jobs must be secured away from the land. The diversity of our community family has brought together a beautiful cornucopia of heart-gifts and talents. To check if we are a good fit, our Adawehi Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast offers two gorgeous rooms available for nightly/weekly rent. 

Adawehi has a multitude of offerings to support you in gaining your personal goals of health such as: personal growth classes, yoga, community events, Beneficial Foods organic grocery, workout equipment, walking trails, ten wellness practitioners, plus a vast collection of supportive CD’s by the founder, Jackie Woods. 

We believe that everyone is entitled to live life in a passionate and creative way. However, to reach this state, you need to be healthy in body, mind, spirit, and emotions. It is this principle on which the Adawehi community was founded. And by living it, that the community has stayed healthy for seventeen years. The vibrancy of health should be a carrier of your spirit’s love into all areas of your expression. We welcome you to join us on our journey. For when people have the support to heal on all levels of their being, their hearts touch other hearts and the world is changed.

EcoJoya is about creating a new paradigm in living—a new paradigm in which people live in community with each other and with their local ecosystems. Mutual honor and respect for one another as well as for the health of the environment are paramount. Living sustainably and working with nature using permaculture and similar guiding principles preserve a joyful happy lifestyle.

EcoJoya is about empowering people and communities to live sustainably, using local resources. 

Our first project is in the cool mountains of Costa Rica where we have 50 acres of pasture, forest, views, springs, creeks, and over five beautiful waterfalls. The temperature varies from 63 F to 78 F all year around.  We have a rainy and dry season. 

All visitors and lengths of stay are welcome, if we have room. Whether you're working for food or just want to enjoy walking to our 80-foot waterfall, we can accommodate you.  Short term visitors pay to stay but we are always make deals with long term volunteers, workers and potential community members that can pull their own weight and contribute.

We are currently seeking people experienced in all aspects of permaculture, farming, and, animal husbandry, construction, homesteading skills, natural building  and video production.

Ideally, we are seeking 4 to 5 small young families like ourselves to share our farm with.  Working together to help with our cottage businesses and educate our children together in a home schooling environment.  Lots of money is not required or at all in some cases.  We are more interested in skills and productive people.

We can sleep between 10 and 15 people in our current community house, with an additional structure and spaces being built. We are and will be experimenting with various natural and alternative structures, including earth-bag, bamboo, geodesic, bermed, cobb, and various prefab options etc. 

We're 10 miles from the nearest large city but isolated enough for peace and comfort. We're about 45 minutes from the Pacific beaches as well.  

We have high-speed internet through wireless links on the farm. So we can have the best of eco-living and high-tech tools for research and communications.

We would like to  be starting various workshops that revolve around both permaculture and sustainable farming and technologies. Sustainable aquaponics is a high priority on our list.

We plan to create lots of video How-To’s and to document every part of our journey. We will ultimately want to evolve into both a prototype and a school that we can duplicate again and again as we expand to other locations around the country and the world.

We are always open to new ideas and better ways of doing things.

There is so much to say.  Our website is not always up but you can try it.
Or contact us here though this listing.

We also have rooms for rent through Airbnb under the title Sustainable Farmhouse in CostaRica

We now have two houses linked by a half acre of land in the progressive Westcott neighborhood of Syracuse, NY, close to Syracuse University and the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. One house is a beautiful 150 year-old historical house on a quiet residential street in Syracuse, NY. The other is over 120 years old, and newly renovated with a kitchen designed for a collective! We practice the idea of &quot;Food, not Lawns&quot; and have an intensive kitchen garden out front, a bathtub salad garden on our driveway, and backyard raised bed production over approximately 1,000 square feet and growing. It hosts several large raised beds, a six-bin compost system, a collection of baby fruit trees, berry bushes, a growing native plant population, and many storm water capture features.  We also have two plots at at Morningside Community Garden which are used for growing more long season crops such as potatoes, cabbage, and garlic. We grow most of our own vegetables June-October, and preserve many types of foods for the winter such as jams, ketchup, salsas, pickles, and tomatoes.

We have a strong commitment to social justice and community participation, with a number of our members involved with local community benefit organizations and initiatives such as Food Not Bombs, The Syracuse Peace Council, The Alchemical Nursery, ArtRage Gallery, the Neighbors of the Onondaga Nation and more. We have organized and led workshops on consensus process and democratic decision making, food preservation, composting, bike fixing, making salves and lotion, natural dyes, and more; and we’ve hosted a number of traveling activists, musicians, and culturally creative persons passing through, or stopping at, Syracuse! With our second house's location on a busy neighborhood street, we hope to increase our educational and community outreach programs.</description>

A Swedish kind of zeitgeist-minded-community.

We have created a non profit organization, where people have a very high understanding and interest in happy and healthy lifestyle, may it include healthy food, gardening, soil, ecology, air, water, polyamory, relationship, sex, fitness, technology, energy, cooperation etc. The general view is SHARING, CARING and LOVING. It's for you who are interested in living closely with other like-minded people and use our skills together.

What might be found or created in this group is:
•	different kinds of workshops 
•	shows
•	homeschooling...
•	food supplied by ourselves
•	organic food
•	a music studio
•	a pool
•	a sauna
•	a library
•	a car pool
•	etc...

But all this depends on what kind of interest people will have once all members have joined.

There are many advantages of creating this as a non profit org, it makes a lot of paper work easier for us.

It's good if you are interested in vegan/vegetarian or raw food as a lifestyle, or at least an understanding of a lifestyle based on high nutritional food and want to move in that direction yourself. 

We prefer a no-drug lifestyle as much as possible. 

The place for this co-op housing will be in the middle of Skåne (in the south of Sweden), close to nature, a very nice place. We have now found a piece of land that is wonderful and we are preparing to buy it asap! We are forming the new group now and really only miss a few more females to get going (for the gender balance). We have created the association and are gathering more info and key persons. All in all maybe 8-10 adult people can live there. We are 5 now. We have found an architect, a skilled brick layer and other skilled people and we continue to gather more contacts and resources.

We are looking for you who want to  join us and live healthily, sustainably, and cheaply in an organic way.

Our different inspiration (vary from person to person in the group) is ecology, polyamory, the zeitgeistmovement, sustainabilty, free energy, permaculture etc.

Does this sound interesting? Then drop me a line as soon as possible.  

PS. The co-op consist mostly of Swedish people, but is open to anyone who joins from other countries too. Women are high priority for the sake of balance, as are kids.  
And you do have to have some kind of economy to support yourself from the start.

We are looking for you who are eager to live a life with a lot of challenges and personal growth together and share life in as many ways as possible and to have fun!

Don't hesitate, get in contact now!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21975&quot;&gt;Finney Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Please visit our website at www.finneyfarm.org for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/finney-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/finney-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Finney Farm consists of 105 wooded acres located in upper Skagit County, Washington.  The land is wet, fertile, lovely, and green.  Our community exists for many reasons:

•	To steward the land in an ecologically sound manner free from traditional development. 

•	To create and maintain affordable housing, eliminating much of the need for forced wage-slavery.

•	To encourage the sharing of resources.

•	To work toward common goals of self-sufficiency, autonomy, and community.

•	To allow members to pursue personal interests such as creative endeavors, activism, and education on a daily basis.

•	To create an environment in which people are living each day with an expectation of open communication, empowerment, and consensus-based decision making.  

•	To encourage a strong community work ethic, which is beneficial to the community as well as the individual. 

We hope to create an environment in which compassion, respect, consideration, independence, integrity, communication, and living the good life are not qualities to be granted or denied but are instead the expectation.  We seek to hold this land from traditional destructive development, instead using ecologically sound methods for any growth.  The permaculture model isn’t a good fad, it’s a timeless commonsense approach to rural living. 

We envision around 10 families living in hand-built houses living on this land.  We have a shared garden and orchards, community meals, some child-care sharing, and a community house which includes kitchen, laundry, bath, and office facilities.  We also get together for homeschooling, farm work projects, art or craft projects, and performance or volunteer opportunities. 

We would like to create a village feel to our community.  We hope to have many skilled members who are able to share resources and would encourage trading for goods within the community before seeking goods outside of Finney Farm.

We currently have seven adults and four children living on the farm.  We have many skills—journeyman carpenter, seamstress, teacher, mother, wild-edibles enthusiast, homebrewer, knitter, musician, flamenco dancer, spinner, vaudeville and burlesque performer, gardener, tree planter, historian, technical drafter, father, counselor, dancer, laborer, fisherman, bellydance instructor, cook, writer, and much more.  We are anarchists/socialists/discordians who are into both DIY living AND community. And a good life.

2016 Update: We currently have 8 adult residents, a few children, and other short term residents (interns, WWOOFers, short term renters etc).  We occasionally have space available (private rooms in the common house or cabins/tiny houses) please see our website or visit our Facebook page for current availability. We get a huge number of inquiries each year and we are growing at an intentionally slow rate because finding a good fit is more important to us than numbers.  If what you have to offer are &quot;leadership skills,&quot; we probably aren't a good fit. We are also more interested in farming, building, rural living, communication/community, alternative energy skills than drumming, yoga, and empath readings.  We attempt to bridge lifestyle activism with direct action by building a social and educational outreach program in our area which includes our seed distro. In 2015 alone, we grew/harvested/processed/packaged/distributed 8000 packages of organic heirloom seed to schools, food banks, and families at no charge.  We have other outreach programs including events, classes, an intern program, etc.</description>

if you want to live in a clean and beautiful house and help keep it that way; 
and if you want to live with other kind, responsible, spiritually conscious and healthy people, 
contact us.  
We are excited to be urban homesteading and want someone who enjoys that.  
We keep a really clean house.  
Communication, collaboration and participation are the keys to community.

We are a conscious, creative household sharing our beautiful, comfy, two-story, five-bedroom Victorian house. 
This is a great central location in Congress Park, a prime Denver area, in a lovely safe neighborhood near downtown &amp;amp; Cherry Creek. Within walking distance are three parks, shops, restaurants, the Tattered Cover bookstore, the film society cinema &amp;amp; the Botanic Gardens.  

There is wireless internet, a private backyard, a big garden with a pond, six fruit trees and 4 chickens and a duck. We want people interested in building community, sustainability and growing food.
Together we create a relaxed comfortable home. We are part of a larger Denver community.
There are 3 bedrooms and a nice bath upstairs as well as a small office/sitting area. Two other rooms and bath are on the main floor.

Rent is $850/mo. which includes utilities. $850 deposit

We want quiet and considerate people who will consider this their home and share in cleaning, gardening and care taking.  We meet as a community on a regular basis.
There's no TV here and no tobacco smoking. We're an organic household; we like healthy food, mostly vegetarian, and share occasional meals. We are relaxed, friendly and easy going. Cats ok. No dogs. 
We like to have Airbnb visitors on occasion.  It's fun to meet new people.

This is an opportunity to practice living in community and creating a happy cooperative household as well as participating with gardening and nutritious meals.
How people relate to each other and how they reciprocate is the basis of any society. We change the world by changing how we relate. Interactions based on kindness create peace.

There is a luxurious rental apartment in the carriage house out back, suitable for a couple or single person.  It has a big deck with room for plants.  We would love to have someone there who would be part of our community.  That rent is $17000/mo.</description>

About one acre is wooded and we are expanding the woods. We planted 3 orchards in fall of 2006 - a nut orchard, a stone fruit orchard and what we call a &quot;papple&quot; orchard with apples, pawpaws, persimmons and pears. We prune and plant every year and are starting to get fruit.  We also have perennial berries, herbs, root crops and flowers. Other adjacent lands available. We want to offer classes in raw vegan food preparation and philosophy and sustainable agriculture.</description>

Being 10 minutes to the nearest town and only 30 minutes northeast of Seattle gives you access to anything one could need, while also providing the atmosphere of being “away from it all” when on site.
 
Our community has usually consisted of between 5 and 10 people in the last several years and anticipates slow growth over the next few years. Indigenous forest, wildlife, and nature trails with some open spaces make for a quiet, peaceful setting.

DMC values sanctuary, spirituality, harmony, diversity, friendship, cooperation, fun, independent thinking, compassion, and the ability to function within an intentional community. Our members observe many diverse faiths in harmony. Members currently provide information and opinions that are considered by the Advisory Council when making decisions.

DMC members enjoy the company of others for movie nights, gatherings, campouts, meetings, and community meals. Members expect the development of more activities in the future.</description>

Avalon Co-op is an eight-room house intent on creating a safe, sane, and supportive environment as part of the Madison Community Cooperative organization and within the city of Madison as a whole. We are a community that welcomes people of all ages, sexes, colors, sexual orientations and economic backgrounds. Key to our evolution as a healthy and united household is the development and practice of constructive, direct communication, consensus decision-making, and the incorporation of feminist ideals into our everyday lives. 

We are a community of eight people and three cats. Some of us work and some go to school. Our house is centrally located in a quiet and diverse neighborhood two blocks from James Madison Park and four blocks from the capitol. We take turns making great vegetarian meals and working in our garden. We welcome open-minded people who are interested in enriching our community and environment.

Currently, we are eight adults and four children. Our ages range from mid twenties to mid forties. 

We are a beautiful and dynamic community that is child-friendly. Our house is clean, cozy, and eco-friendly. We want to live with people who are more than just housemates but rather part of a bigger family that is supportive of personal growth.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/21997&quot;&gt;Lotus Lodge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Co-creating a space of mutual respect, awakening, grace and joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/lotus-lodge/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/lotus-lodge/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Lotus Lodge is a unique shared-house community located just 12 minutes from the heart of downtown Asheville, NC. We have 9 adult men and women (about half each), currently ages 20s-70s, in a quiet, 2-story four-plex (converted old 4400 sq. ft. farm house into 4 full apartments that people typically, share plus now a new, 1-room, private studio apartment, all under one roof. Rooms for long or short-term residency open up intermittently, so contact us if interested. Studio apartment ($800/mo plus electric) and rooms (about $500/month plus electric) are furnished, sunny and attractive. Includes WiFi and TV access. Electricity per person is about $44/month on average). Studio is perfect for business travelers or people relocating who need a home space for a few weeks or months. Email (preferred) or call for availability.

The large group room downstairs welcomes everyone and is where we have intermittent movie / TV nights, house concerts, potlucks and sometimes workshop space. Outdoor shared areas include a big front porch, back patio, fire pit, clotheslines (which some use year 'round) organic gardens and rain barrels to water them (into permaculture). Across the street is a wooded walking path alongside Hominy Creek. We are in a semi-rural area (Candler) yet close to all the amenities of downtown Asheville, NC. 

Part of what is unique about Lotus Lodge is that the 9 of us are quite autonomous. Some work full or part time away from home, and/or go into town with some frequency so there's a surprising amount of quiet and privacy, even in the shared apartments. We almost never do meetings and each person has their own food (all types of food are ok, though we all tend toward organic, non-gmo and healthy), own cupboard and refrigerator space, and each determines when to connect with others for mealtime or whatever. This translates to people enjoying each other's company frequently and often eating together mostly on an impromptu, inspired basis with each eating their own food. It flows.

It's really the best of both worlds - of having your own space &amp;amp; life, as well as having a sense of family &amp;amp; community with 8 other friendly, caring, intelligent, interesting and health-conscious people. Some folks do meditation &amp;amp; Qi Kong or Tai Chi regularly, some lean toward vegetarian foods, most also eat some meat, eggs &amp;amp; dairy - and all are free to do their thing. Residents tend to be well educated, progressive, creative, upbeat and great to be around. We enjoy meaningful conversations, laughter, privacy and mutual respect, and we maintain a tidy space.  

If interested in possibly living or staying here, please email me at: gayatri.erlandson@gmail.com with a paragraph about you that includes your ideal timeframe for being here, and a REQUEST for our questionnaire which we'll send to you right away. Once we get your filled-out questionnaire returned, we'll get back to you within a day or so and - if all seems like a go, we can proceed with a call and then a face-to-face meeting(s) here at the Lodge for you and at least some of us to see if we're a good fit. To stay short-term, just email us of your interest or call, 828-581-9036.

If you do join us as a long-term resident, you'll likely enjoy many good times and little drama - and hopefully will stay a good while. No smokers or pets please. Best regards to your collaborative living! Namaste, Gaya Erlandson, PhD (founder, owner &amp;amp; resident committed to healthy, happy living). 

Note: If you are relocating to the area, we can refer you to a really good local real estate broker to be your buyer's agent.</description>

We are a group organized as an LLC that that owns a beautiful 120 acre property with waterfront on Post Pond, forest and meadow. We run Loch Lyme Lodge, the 22-cabin based hospitality business we purchased as part of the parcel on which we are also building a 16-24 unit, multi-age, intentional cohousing neighborhood, one mile from Lyme village and 10 miles from Hanover, NH. Pinnacle is appropriate for singles, couples, and families. Lyme is a rural community with two town centers. Hanover is a vibrant college town with an excellent tertiary care medical center. Our design assumes 6-8 apodments/homes integrated into the common house with three or four (4) additional duplexes. We are creating an attractive, comfortable, environmentally intelligent neighborhood in which one can live, raise a family and live long into retirement, aging in your own home within an inter-generational community.  

Our website begins with this paragraph: &quot;Did you ever wish you had a big rambling house on a pond with fruit trees and gardens?...Do you fondly remember your days in college or graduate school and miss the group dinners with stimulating conversation?...Does the idea of living comfortably for less than it costs to live on your own appeal to you?.&quot;

We are co-stewards with Tryon Life Community Farm and the Bridgewalkers Alliance of seven beautiful half-wooded acres surrounded by a 650-acre forest, all inside Portland on a bus line half an hour by bicycle from downtown. (TLC Farm is a separate and independent nonprofit sustainability education and demonstration center--see www.tryonfarm.org. The BWA is a POC and trans collective focused on making the land available to marginalized people who have less access to land.) We are blessed with the opportunity for the work of our relations with each other and the earth to be shared with thousands of visitors. As we learn the skills and practices of growing respect, responsibility, and joy, they resonate out through our communities.

In this way, we're becoming ancestors of an earth people that navigate the coming tumult with spirit and courage.

We were born in fire. Our evolution on this land between 2004 and 2006 was galvanized by the campaign to prevent the land we occupy from being bulldozed for a high-impact housing development. We have faced the stresses, conflicts, and tensions this high-pressure environment caused, as well as the &quot;standard&quot; ones all communities face, and have developed a clear focus on community process to deal with them.

It is a lot of work to live here. Members pay the equivalent of market-rate rent, and are expected to contribute at least ten hours to the community's economic work every week, and volunteer with TLC Farm (many do more). We have weekly meetings, alternating between business &quot;meetings of the minds&quot; and relation-building &quot;meetings of the hearts.&quot; We share evening meals and rotate cooking, cleaning, and maintenance chores. We encourage low-impact density and so have relatively little individual space (though a great deal of shared, communal space).

And yet the rewards are tremendous. We live deeply interwoven with all our relations. We encourage each other to discover our evolving niches in the ecology of change: political action, deep spirit, earth-rooted wisdom. We reduce our ecological footprint, learn the resonance between autonomy and cooperation, grow into wisdom and compassion, and jam rhythms and harmonies and sutras into the long, warm evenings.

Members are encouraged to use alternate forms of transportation (we have a car co-op), minimize energy use (no central heating), and eat local, organic, unrefined food. Our regular community ceremonies (from circles around dinner to high holidays) reflect our eclectic backgrounds, but are earth-based and heart-felt.

If your soul yearns to work closely with others in an integrated lifestyle catalyzing the emergence of a new world in the shell of the old, contact us!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22018&quot;&gt;Ames Cohousing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to create a sustainability activism community focusing on finance, food, and energy. A large component of our efforts is promoting the universal basic income movement, and alternative currencies that demonstrate the tangible economic value that basic income provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ames-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ames-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ames Cohousing is a retrofit cohousing community within walking distance of Iowa State University. It is both easy to get to by car, less than 15 minutes from interstate 35, and a completely walkable and bikeable community, with the University 5 blocks away, and a employee-owned grocery store chain 4 blocks away.

We use the phrase eco-village, but we are really in an eco-state. When it's windy, Iowa produces more energy that it uses, and the City of Ames municipal utility listens when citizen activists ask for more renewables. With your help, we could make the entire city of Ames and Iowa State University be net carbon-negative in 5 years. This starts with conversion of the two houses to use entirely electric/hydronic heat so we can heat water when the wind blows, and store that energy for when it does not.

One of our members has a 350 farm in northern Iowa growing human food soybeans, and would like to see you join us and help develop food finance and distribution models that let us feed people, not capital.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22023&quot;&gt;EcoReality Co-op&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our focus is permaculture, sustainable living, food and energy production, and education.

Because humans have tipped the planet out of energetic balance, leading to increasing overpopulation, conflict, famine, and extinction, possibly of humans themselves, we, the members and advisors of the Ecoreality community agree to honor our individual roles as part of a collective that is committed to sustainability in all its forms. 

Here is our mission (an action plan that guides us):

We choose to build a loving community together in the South Gulf Islands of British Columbia, Canada. 
As a community, we pledge to learn by practice and exploration how to apply principles of ecology, non-violence, awareness, diversity, and education toward the achievement of a lifestyle that is a result of intentional sustainable actions and alternatives to the state of the world (see first line). To do this, we agree to use clear, compassionate communication and written process, and to empower people through ongoing group awareness and processes that promote personal responsibility and accountability. We agree to share knowledge and materials in ways that promote our community values. Finally, we will support our mission actions by appropriate tools that we all agree to use, such as consensus decision-making. 
 
Furthermore, we endorse a common set of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.EcoReality.org/wiki/Values&quot;&gt;values&lt;/a&gt; in priority order, from which we derive our common &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.EcoReality.org/wiki/Vision&quot;&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.EcoReality.org/wiki/Purpose&quot;&gt;purpose&lt;/a&gt; statements, the latter of which we periodically review and ratify by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.EcoReality.org/wiki/Consensus&quot;&gt;unanimous consent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ecoreality/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ecoreality/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
EcoReality Sustainable Land Use and Education Cooperative is developing an ecovillage in the south Gulf Islands of British Columbia, Canada. This ecovillage will be a model of sustainable food and energy production and will include public outreach and education as goals.

We have acquired a 43-acre property next to a 61-acre “community farmland” site, backed by a thousand of acres of public parkland, all the way to the highest peak on the island, and down to the ocean.

The property has cleared, productive farmland (mostly in hay), riparian and laucustrine areas, and young forest. The public parkland extends from the highest point on the island (Bruce Peak, at 704 metres), all the way to the ocean at Burgoyne Bay, and up the other side to the second-highest point (Mount Maxwell, at 579 metres).

All of the property is irrigated by a two-acre pond and two year-round streams via an extensive buried irrigation system. The class-2 soils are in growing zones 8 and 9. We have been implementing a Permaculture design for the site.

Two houses with a total of 4,200 sq ft of living space have eleven bedrooms, four bathrooms, and two kitchens between them, as well as ample room for meetings and home-based businesses. Three members live in these buildings, sharing them with renters, WWOOFers, and visitors.

A garage/studio/workshop of about 1,200 sq ft is used as a classroom for Permaculture and agriculture classes and public events. The classroom seats 40.

We also have a 3,550 sqft &quot;high tunnel&quot; poly greenhouse, divided into zones for propagation, nursery, and direct seeding.

New as of September 2016: we have salvaged a wonderful 3,080 sqft glass and aluminum greenhouse, currently in pieces, awaiting drier weather so we can start foundation work.

We have begun a public education campaign leading to re-zoning that will enable construction of a number of additional dwelling units. Current zoning allows three additional houses and a cottage. We have completed studies that show a larger number of dwelling units are appropriate, based on both carrying capacity of the land and agricultural labour needs, which is the legal requirement for more dwellings. This will be a political process, with at least three government bodies and public hearings involved.

We are seeking additional members who can contribute approximately half the value of a typical North American suburban house to the project. Prospective members with outstanding skills who can contribute less are encouraged to contact us.

      <name>MOSAIC Co-op</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22024&quot;&gt;MOSAIC Co-op&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Through cooperative action, MOSAIC seeks to develop a diverse, inclusive community which inspires and empowers creative, conscious, sustainable living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/mosaic-communities/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/mosaic-communities/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;MOSAIC (&quot;Members of Society Acting in Cooperation&quot;) began as the brainchild of a group of Northwestern students who were interested in finding an alternative form of student housing in Evanston. They founded the original house at 2013-2015 Ridge Avenue, and in September of 1998 the first 12 co-op members moved in. 

They established the original mission statement and developed a house structure based on cooperative living. Using the mission statement, they tried to guide the activities of the house along principles such as environmental sustainability, consensus decision making, and social &amp; political activism.

In the summer of 2004, MOSAIC moved to its current location at 2000 Sherman Avenue (known as &quot;The Zooo&quot;), where we have resided ever since. Additionally, in 2015, MOSAIC expanded to a second house at 1427 Elmwood Avenue (&quot;The Treehouse&quot;). Today, MOSAIC is a vibrant, two-house, 23-person cooperative, with ambitions of further expansion and development in the future.

By pooling our resources, we hope to minimize our costs of living and maximize the power behind our decisions as conscious consumers. We are a close-knit community dedicated to living out our ideals and values in our daily actions and interactions.

Our first house, &quot;The Zooo&quot;, is approximately two blocks from Northwestern University, and most of our members (in either house) are students there. However, we have no formal affiliation with the university, and we welcome undergraduate students, graduate students, non-students, students of life, and everyone else.

To learn more about our co-op, please visit our website or email us! Additionally, if our community interests you, please feel free to stop by for dinner sometime — both of our houses have several vegetarian/vegan communal dinners per week, and guests are always welcome.</description>

In addition to our eco-friendly lodgings, our volunteer and intern programs allow you to work with your Heart, doing creative work, with your Body doing physical work and with your Brain doing tech, writing and/or research!

In other words, you can enjoy a community oriented working and educational vacation in Hawaii at a much lower cost than a traditional tourist staying in a hotel.

As one of the few feminist oriented communities in the world we have a number of programs both on the property and with our EcoFeminist Entrepreneur websites, which work towards gender equality through a philosophy of female empowerment rather than victimization.

As a result, our community is increasingly popular with women and progressive men around the world!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/hedonisia-hawaii-sustainable-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/hedonisia-hawaii-sustainable-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hedonisia Hawaii is a sustainable community of volunteers, interns and eco-tourists from around the world. We are located in the rainforest region of the 'Big Island' of Hawaii. 

We define ourselves as an eco-feminist 'community of individuals'. So even though we are active on a number of feminist, social and environmental causes, visitors can enjoy a vacation at our community without even know about some of our community projects!

For travelers who wish to enjoy a socially progressive working vacation, Hedonisia Hawaii offers a Fair-Trade Volunteer Program as well as a Sustainable Community Manager Internship where you can learn by actually living in and helping to manage an ecotourist community in Hawaii!</description>

****Please NO EMAILS. Contact Us Via Messaging on our Facebook Page****

The Sugar Shack is a Los Angeles intentional community committed to social change through cooperative living, art, and activism. We do this by living communally in Mid-City and providing free of charge spaces for individuals and group gatherings.

All residents of our home are actively dedicated to the principles of sustainability and creative collaboration. Each of us contributes to a mutual support structure that connects us together in shared purpose, despite our diverse backgrounds. 

We strive to maintain a tranquil yet vibrant environment in our building. The cleanliness of our home leaves guests speechless. We share a commitment to bring consciousness and devotion into all aspects of domestic life. We achieve this through our weekly house meetings, our comprehensive chore-sharing system, and our &quot;No Dish Left Behind&quot; policy.


The Sugar Shack also includes two outdoor patios, a garden, and a large 2-floor warehouse of workspaces and artist's studios.

It is The Sugar Shacks continuing mission to embody every positive potential of cooperative living, and to act as a heart of a larger community of integrity, joy and peace.

Social change and personal transformation are central to our vision.

Chrysalis has two houses side-by-side in a wooded setting about 10 minutes’ drive from Washington, DC. The houses can handle eight to ten permanent residents comfortably, with plenty of room for each person to have both personal space and an office or studio if they wish. The common rooms can accommodate up to 50 people for events. The houses front on a large park, with miles of bike and hiking trails and unspoiled nature. Music is an important part of life at Chrysalis.At Chrysalis, each person is empowered to take initiative and create their own projects, healing the society while building a supportive web of intimate relationships that nurture inner transformation. We use many techniques, including sacred touch, non-violent communication, being in the moment, and more. Our goal is to love the world through loving oneself.

Chrysalis encourages members to follow their own vision in the context of a creative, supportive community; we find the ongoing cross-pollination of ideas, talents, and energy takes us to a higher and more productive level. Resident non-members and non-residents are also an important part of Chrysalis; we see our community as part of a much larger network.

We are especially looking for people who want to explore their own limits, both personally and productively, who like to be synergized by being around other creative and effective people, and who would enjoy living in an environment that is both challenging and supportive, that invites you to grow while affirming who and what you are.

We actively welcome people who are not members to live with us; we value the unique contribution each person has to make. We are less focused on long-term commitments, and more interested in the energy and ideas that our housemates have to offer in the present. We welcome those who would like to work and play and learn with us, whether it be &quot;for a day or a decade.&quot;</description>

Struggle Mountain is an intentional community that has existed since the 1960s. It was named by Joan Baez when she lived here. After renting for most of a decade, it was bought by the community in 1976.  This intentional community evolved out of the sixties' counterculture and, most particularly, nonviolence and the draft resistance movement.

The MacKenzie Heights Collective, formerly known as the King Edward House, has been a cooperative household for over 40 years in the Kitsilano/Dunbar neighbourhood of Vancouver, BC. We have been operating under the same basic principles of shared living since we were established. We share vegetarian meals, social gatherings, environmental consciousness, ideas and laughter. 

Each member of the community cooks one vegetarian dinner per week, and we rotate shopping and household chores. We buy our groceries primarily from local or organic suppliers.  Our shared meals are vegetarian, although individuals do on occasion eat meat within the house as a separate event from our shared dinners. We have hosted a variety of community gatherings including study groups, potlucks, music nights and occasional dance parties (hallowe'en, new years). 

Our large, character home has plenty of common spaces, hardwood floors, a fireplace, a cold cellar, and a great view of the mountains and city. We have created a front yard that contains many plants which are indigenous to the Cascadia Bioregion and large trees that shield our home from the road. The backyard has our vegetable/herb gardens, patio, shed/garage, and compost system.  We have excellent, quick bus service to UBC and downtown, as well as secure indoor bicycle storage.

Village Terraces is a neighborhood within Earthaven Ecovillage. Our vision is to create extended family and a deep connectedness to the earth, ourselves, and each other. As the first cohousing group at Earthaven, we are building and living densely in order to share resources, including extensive common space, facilities, and utilities. Of our envisioned four buildings we have built two, which house ten full members, two children, several interns, and a business selling medicinal herbs. We will eventually share the neighborhood with 24 to 30 adults plus children. 

The cohousing style provides “apartments” that can include private kitchenettes and baths, with the added benefit of shared common spaces such as a large common kitchen and bath, common gardens, orchards, and a pasture for dairy animals. We also have access to Earthaven’s Council Hall and other community facilities, as well as shared use of most of Earthaven’s 329 acres.

We share all of Earthaven's ecological and spirit-guided values and agreements. In addition, the following values are particularly important to us:

•	A desire to raise children together in a neighborhood and village context.
•	Honest and responsible communication with an active willingness to resolve conflicts in a healthy manner.
•	A commitment to consciously and lovingly raising both plants and animals for food.
•	Love and acceptance of ourselves, our bodies, and the cycles of life and death.
•	Cooperative living in common-walled buildings built with local materials.

To learn more about the process of joining Village Terraces, read our Initial Contact Letter on our website.

Joining Village Terraces Neighborhood means first becoming a member of Earthaven Ecovillage. Please explore the village through our website, a tour, and extended visits.

We (a healthy, older couple plus one foody/green housemate plus seasonal WWOOFers, volunteers and interns) are seeking conscious dialogue/visitation with one or two more (a healthy couple, perhaps?) highly motivated grower, community-conscious, foody comrades/partners/landmates for more-than-transient stewardship, gardening, infrastructure building, farm visioning, and potential farm transference within the decade. We've had two decades of success and fun with goat dairy, soil building, greenhouses, workshops, gardens, orchards, seed saving, flowers, etc. We share one large, ark-like home (needs more renovation/green retrofitting. NO other dwellings are possible). Looking for one or two highly motivated, competent, sober, green, permaculturally stoked friends (who only lack the right land) to explore the next level.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22052&quot;&gt;Beaver Creek Homestead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; sustainability and learning are essential for a fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/beaver-creek-homestead/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/beaver-creek-homestead/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
The Beaver Creek Homestead is no less than an attempt, likely futile, in starting society from scratch.

The goals are to develop:
1: Cyclical systems of food-waste-fertilizer-food
2: Methods of power generation and use such that no additional power is required from either the existing grid or internal combustion engine (ICE) generators.
3: Building techniques that use available resources as much as possible and passive heating and cooling.
4: Self-directed methods of education modeled on places like the Summerhill School that recognize the importance of individual choice.
5: An alternative to the current existing Capitalist economic system that is more effective at distributing resources based on effort and need rather than property ownership.
6: Alternative social structures and institutions that maximize individual liberty while maintaining social cohesion.  The community must be capable of having a place for everyone, from the cradle to the grave.  (Needs work!)

It is a daunting goal and not for the feint of heart.  There are numerous challenges to overcome.  Some of the larger of them are:

1: Climate:  This area has winter temps that range into the -30c range and can have anywhere from 3 to 6 months of snow coverage.  Summers can get to nearly 40C with humidity of 90%+.

2: Social:  Canada has a pretty conservative culture in general and does not welcome change or alternative viewpoints.  This area is no exception.  Additionally there is bound to be some upheaval and resistance when changing anything that has inertia behind it.

3: Economic:  This region is probably one of the poorest areas in North America economically.  There are very few opportunities locally and none that are very rewarding.  This makes the fact that even a limited dependence on the existing infrastructure becomes problematic.

What we require from potential members:

1: You not only think outside the box, but were born to live outside it.
2: You have expertise that will enable us to achieve one or more of the above goals.
3: Passion, Dedication and Self-Direction.  You have no trouble picking a task and seeing it through to completion.
4: A commitment to the scientific method.  You do not trust divine revelation or convention but rather practical, careful, testing.  You have a deep mistrust of superstition and embrace modern knowledge, without necessarily embracing all modern applications of that knowledge.

You like BIG challenges.

Sophia Community is an intentional community living in a lovely big house in Hyde Park, near the University of Chicago. Four young women who had all spent a year doing volunteer work in inner-city Chicago neighborhoods founded Sophia Community in 1993.

We live in Quaker House, where we manage the house and guest business on behalf of the 57th Street Meeting of Friends. We have 1 family and 4 singles in the community at present, and are open to more families.

Our key values are:
•Simple Living: communal chores, some  organic food, shared community space, common household fund; 
•Presence to Each Other: commitment to relationships, shared meals; 
•Social Justice: we try to live the change we want; 
•Spirituality: diverse, but we share spirituality together on special occasions; and 
•Hospitality: we run a small guest business for traveling Quakers and others.

Omega House is a big beautiful home located south of downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. It has been an intentional community since 1968.

We are diverse in age and gender, and queer-friendly. Our home is often a gathering place for community events, and we like to be involved with our neighborhood.

In the summer we have a CSA share, and throughout the year we collectively buy food from our local coop. Omega manages the community garden located next door to the house, and residents are involved in taking care of the garden. We value living sustainably and many of us are particularly interested in sustainable agriculture and food justice.   We also own a Hobby Farm/Piece of forest land in northern wisconsin we retreat to for projects and bonding.

We operate according to flexible principles of consensus. Residents are expected to contribute financially, share maintenance responsibilities, and engage with the community through labor and regular meetings.

Residents have private bedrooms, and all other rooms and spaces are shared.

If you are clear for yourself that supporting the transition of our destructive society to a sustainable world is your first priority, you will love this &amp; we are looking for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/8th-life-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/8th-life-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;8thLife is an EcoVillage project starting in the Canary Islands &amp; a unique opportunity to invest in a healthy future: for you, for your family, for future generations &amp; for all species.
We are repopulating a rural farmstead and establishing a community to do more effective work in facilitating the global and local Transition, and also researching in action, from the basis of Integral Permaculture, what is needed for EcoVillage projects to be truly successful and thrive, and how civilized western humans can create community and the seeds of a new culture.

TerraVie is a qualified recipient for an ecological gift, certified by the Minister of the Environment of Quebec.
 
TerraVie is devoted to scrupulously managing the land at their disposition in conformity with its charter and principles. TerraVie is committed to preserve its objectives, irrespective of the socioeconomic or political context. 

This initiative is based on the principle that land is not a commodity, but a fundamental resource to be maintained for the community as a whole.

Although land trusts are established for similar reasons, TerraVie is different in that its purpose also includes the development of viable ecological communities.

It acts as a local, sustainable, environmentally conscious stimulator while educating the public about the various aspects of lifestyles in harmony with nature. It emphasizes the development of communities that minimize the exploitation of resources and financial speculation on land.

In Laurentides at Montcalm, TerraVie purchased on September 5, 2006, 250 acres of land with a lake (40 acres) and two downstream rapids.

On September 5, 2006, TerraVie purchased 288 acres of land near the hamlet of Moncalm in the Laurentian Mountains north of Montreal. The mainly forested land has access to a lake and two rapid flowing streams.

TerraVie rents part of the land (25 %) to two nonprofit cooperatives (housing and employment) that manage the activities of the ecovillage. The cooperatives are responsible for the buildings, but cannot own the land or the natural resources. They are obliged to ensure the ecological integrity of all activities and construction within their territory. The cooperatives must respect the ecological charter and fundamental principles of TerraVie as described on our website.

The board and members of TerraVie are working towards the creation of a legal structure to facilitate the establishment of community land trusts (CLTs) and ecovillages throughout Quebec. The research studies that stem from this project will be made available to the general public.

TerraVie received the ¨Phoenix of the Environment 2007&quot; award in the categorie “sustainable development” for its pilot project at Montcalm. This prize is the highest distinction from the minister of environment of Quebec.</description>

This is a place that is a joy to return to, supportive of our lives, work, and service, a foundation for friendships, filled with laughter, music, art, yummy food, responsive to, and supportive of life's challenges, respectful of diversity, earth friendly, and a strong contributing household to the Sunward Community.

We recognize that cooperative living is an ever-evolving work in progress. Miscommunication is bound to happen. Tempers will flare. Feelings will be hurt. And most of the time the collective effort of creating a sense of place, a community, will lift our spirits and make us feel all warm and fuzzy inside. We acknowledge the minefield and we enjoy the dance together as we move through it. To this end, house participation, being social, and doing chores are important priorities. 

AND YOU? We are open to chatting with folks about possibilities. This would include someone who:

• Will make our house better than without you
• Is passionate about dancing
• Is excited about cooperative living
• Follows an ecologically sustainable lifestyle
• Will say what you mean and do what you say
• Is responsible, fun loving, emotionally mature, and financially stable
• Likes to eat and cook healthy organic food for a group
• Keeps a very clean and tidy house and kitchen
• Likes to live without TV
• Doesn't use tobacco, artificial scents, or have a furry pet
• is enthused to be part of our community

Ours is one of 40 households comprising Sunward Cohousing, an intentional community where resources are shared, lives are simplified, the Earth is respected, diversity is welcomed, children play together in safety, and living in community comes naturally. We are located about 4 miles west of downtown Ann Arbor on 20 beautiful acres including woods, ponds, organic gardens, playfields, an antique barn, and more.</description>

Founded in 1999, Millstone Co-op is a community of 11 people living and working in Somerville (and the broader Metro area) to make our corner of the world a better place to be. We also strive to make our house a positive, supportive and fun place to call home.

At Millstone, we share chores and other responsibilities, as well as many of our meals. House members prepare and serve vegetarian dinners three times per week, and guests and friends are always welcome for dinner or for one of our community brunches. We value local community, social justice, diversity, and environmental sustainability, and we try to make choices in what we buy, eat, and do that reflect these values. We also make decisions by consensus and place an emphasis on open communication.

Individually or as a house, we love to grow things indoors and out; we love making, listening to, and dancing to music; we get involved in local and national politics; we get addicted to really good TV series on DVD (e.g. The Office, Lost, and Project Runway); we brew, bake and can; we read the local free papers and national news blogs (and sometimes juicy tabloids); we go to drag shows, karaoke nights, salsa dances, and bluegrass concerts; we frequent bars and libraries; and mostly if you're into something we're all ears (and eyes, hands, feet, etc.)!

We also have eight associate members who live outside of GGC, some of whom participate very regularly in our activities.  We meet Fridays for a meal together and monthly for business.

In addition to meals and meetings, we also gather together to share happy and sad events in our lives, celebrate holidays, and hold movie nights and game nights. We have work-parties to accomplish larger community tasks, and garden together.

We are a retrofit or infill type of cohousing project, using existing houses in the neighborhood to create our intentional community. We have friendly relations with most of our immediate neighbors, some of whom participate in some activities with us.  Currently fourteen houses within our boundary are owned by members of Genesee Garden Cohousing.  Some of these houses are still in the process of major renovation.  

We are looking for new members! There are houses for sale nearby that, once purchased, could be included as part of Genesee Garden Cohousing. There are also options for renting, both within Genesee Gardens Cohousing and in the immediate neighborhood.</description>

      <name>700th Millennium Community (formerly 7th Millennium Community)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22079&quot;&gt;700th Millennium Community (formerly 7th Millennium Community)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To establish the self-reliant, self-sufficient, self-sustainable communes, cooperatives &amp;amp; ecological villages in the logistic, safe &amp;amp; strategic environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/7th-millennium-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/7th-millennium-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
     The 700th (formerly 7th) Millennium Community is the proposed self-reliant, self-sufficient, self-sustainable cooperative composed of a Christian or Messianic camp, beach resort, conference &amp;amp; retreat center, retirement complex, kibbutz, guided tour, with some cottage industries, enterprises, &amp;amp; general consulting services.  The Christians, Messianic, other believers &amp;amp; followers ought to be the creators of jobs &amp;amp; suppliers of the goods &amp;amp; services, rather than mere employees &amp;amp;  consumers.  They ought to be working for the Creator, Elohim, YHVH &amp;amp;/or Christ rather than for the cartel or monopolistic groups, credit, market, material-oriented &amp;amp; for the &quot;front&quot; churches, clubs, companies, establishments, industries, institutions, missions, NGOs, societies, &amp;amp; others.

     First, we are going back to the earliest Messianic era by emulating most of the living &amp;amp; working practices of the original New Testament Church (Acts 2:44-45; 4:32-35).

     Second, we are going to emulate the excellent examples on the self-sustainable communes, communities of the Mennonites, Hutterian Brethren, Amish, Bruderhof, Noiva do Cordeiro, 12 Tribes Community, &amp;amp; few other intentional communities that are religious, secular, ecological, &amp;amp; sustainable villages.  We are also hoping to follow the successful kibbutzim in Israel.

     Third, we are striving to live our daily lives in preparation for our Messiah’s second coming or Utopia whether it occurs in the next 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 years, or beyond!  
 
     Conceived as the ideal solutions to the problems of the Sabbath-observing, Christians, Messianic, other believers &amp;amp; followers, we in the 700th Millennium Community will pursue the establishment of the self-reliant, self-sufficient or sustainable cooperative so as to provide an alternative homeland to live in for safety, security, ideal retirement living.  To create job opportunities for our fellow &amp;amp; would-be Christians, Messianic, other  leaders &amp;amp; followers:  students, graduates, underemployed &amp;amp; unemployed persons who are interested to search for, to know &amp;amp; understand the general truths, &amp;amp; apply them in their lives.  To seek associations, fellowships, &amp;amp; partnerships with similar intentional communities in other countries, &amp;amp; be their mission, outreach partners in the Philippines according to His will.  The proposed sites would be somewhere in Southern Leyte &amp;amp; other provinces in the Philippines, or when our Creator or Provider opens the doors.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Links:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Alternative, Renewable Fuels and Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;:
You have been deceived by the oil cartels!  The alternative &amp;amp; renewable fuels are available since 200 years ago!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Wanted:  Hovercraft &amp;amp; other Modern Transportation&lt;/a&gt;:
Why we need the passenger hovercraft &amp;amp; other unique transportation in the Philippines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;IDL = a Mark of the Beast&lt;/a&gt;:
The Christians working &amp;amp; living between west of the International Date Line &amp;amp; east of the Garden of Eden/Jerusalem/Israel longitudinal line have been observing the wrong weekly and yearly Sabbaths for 6 millennia!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Armageddon, Great Tribulation, Wormwood:  How to Survive&lt;/a&gt;:  We are now living through the major signs of the times.  Who, why, what to do, where, when &amp;amp; how to establish or join other preppers for the endtimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Kingdom of Elohim on Earth&lt;/a&gt;: The original New Testament Church applied the self-sustainable lifestyle, as clearly described in Acts 2:44-45; 4:32-35, which some of the religious, secular groups &amp;amp; individuals globally have been practicing from several decades to over 4.9 centuries.  The unfortunate poor persons in the churches, congregations, assemblies, charismatic movements &amp;amp; other religious organizations need to send &quot;a note to God&quot; to ask Him so that the millionaires, billionaires, wealthy &amp;amp; blessed Christian, Messianic members &amp;amp; other worshipers would act on and apply His words.    
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;How to Build Inexpensive Homes or Shelters&lt;/a&gt;:
Millions to billions of the people have the freedom, liberty &amp;amp; option to build the inexpensive homes or shelters. They can chose to follow the self-sufficient, self-sustainable lifestyles of the original Body of Yahshua or Christ that started on the Day of Pentecost in Jerusalem about 2,000 years ago!&lt;/li&gt;

Walnut Street Co-op is a social change oriented cooperative household in Eugene, Oregon. In September 2000 we moved into a large, rambling house together, seeking to build community. Three years later we formed a legal co-op, funding the project with many small loans from like-minded individuals. As housemates, we eat dinner together, share chores, attend house meetings and work parties, and have a basic commitment to resolve conflicts. We trust that each person holds a piece of the truth, and we are committed to deep listening with each other. Over time we’re finding that our friendships are deepening and a shared vision is emerging based on creating shifts in society toward dialogue, deliberation, and integration of diverse viewpoints.

We support each other's commitment to social justice with a caring, creative, and fun living environment.

Stone Soup is made up of 38 members in three properties. Two houses are in Chicago's Uptown neighborhood and the third is in the McKinley Park neighborhood. Communal dinners are held five nights a week, including a weekly Tuesday potluck that is open to the public (please call ahead).

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22127&quot;&gt;Torri Superiore Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Ecovillage, sustainable community, responsible tourism, organic farming, social inclusion and participatory processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/torri-superiore-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/torri-superiore-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The medieval village of Torri Superiore is situated in the Ligurian hinterland, close to the town of Ventimiglia (11 km away). Torri Superiore is an ecovillage and a member of the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN), RIVE (rete italiana veillaggi ecologici), and Accademia Italiana di Permacultura.

The village was abandoned by all original inhabitants, and progressively restored over the last 25 years by a community of Italians and Germans. The village is made of 160 rooms, all built in local stone and lime, which still feature the traditional arches and vaults.

The cultural association that has developed the project since 1989 is formed also by non-residents and owns about 50 percent of the village, while the other 50 percent is individually owned by the members. Only members of the association are entitled to buy property in Torri Superiore.

The restoration of the buildings respects the original characters of the beautiful hamlet while using ecological materials and appropriate technologies whenever possible. A variety of courses and educational activities is offered every year, on topics always related to sustainabilyt and communal living. Organic agriculture activities focus mainly on olive oil production and vegetable gardens to supply the community &amp; guesthouse.

The proximity to the beautiful river and the sea, the easily accessible walks on the surrounding mountains, and the mild climate make Torri Superiore an attractive location for ecologically sensitive people who appreciate the informal, friendly style of the group. A welcoming ecological guesthouse with cozy bedrooms, a large panoramic meeting room and an excellent organic restaurant is open to all visitors and groups. Check our facebook page for current events.

We are 14-15 active and creative people with a colorful variety of interests and fields. We share vegan meals every night and each of us is responsible for cooking dinner twice a month. We each have a cleaning chore and are part of a work team—food, finance, maintenance, or membership. We have quarterly work parties where we do maintenance projects around the house. We do various do-it-yourself projects together, including tending to our garden, brewing kombucha, fixing up bikes, etc. 

We run our twice monthly meetings by consensus and use rotating facilitation in an effort to create a nonhierarchical system of governance.

The Sherwood Co-op is the last organizational remnant of the Students Cooperative Association started in the 1930s by University of Washington students, which at its high point was on a level with the Ann Arbor and Berkeley campus co-op systems. The SCA sold off all of its holdings in the late 1950s. Sherwood rented our current house from the late 1970s until 2001, when we bought it. We take great pride in the accomplishment of a few students to finance and see through the legal work of purchasing our property. We received help from the North American Students of Cooperation (NASCO) in this endeavor.

Since the purchase of our house, we have joined the Evergreen Land Trust (ELT) to ensure that our property remains a cooperative. Our long-term goal is for Sherwood to act as an economic and organizational engine for the development of other co-ops. Our short-term goals are to steward our house, to support and learn from each other, and to have fun while we do it. 

 There is so much more to say about our house and ourselves. If you would like more information about Sherwood, or if you are interested in membership or subletting, email us.

We are an independent housing co-op in a historic neighborhood on the near west side of Madison, Wisconsin. The co-op was formed in 1970 when we obtained ownership of a large, three-story house from an agricultural fraternity at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

The membership has gone through many changes since then, but the goal has always been to provide affordable housing in a friendly, family-like community environment. Our diverse membership includes students, professionals, and working folks from all walks of life, and we share no particular political or ideological bent.

We all share the duties of running the house, from cooking to cleaning to keeping the books, through a work-job system that entails about five hours per week of work, plus dish-washing or floor-mopping duty every week or so.

The heart of our community life revolves around the delicious, vegetarian-option house meals served Sunday through Thursday at 6pm. We make decisions, usually by simple majority, at mandatory house meetings held every two and a half weeks. Temporary committees are regularly created to handle specific projects such as financial planning or landscape planning.

What makes us special? We're a bunch of quirky, unrelated folks who manage to operate almost like a family and run a clean, friendly home, and it works!

Audre Lorde Co-op is a 15-room household that provides a safe space for people of all ages committed to advocating a sustainable and socially just society. We are an actively pro-people-of-color, racial justice, pro-feminist, and pro-queer/LGBT-loving household. Our intent is to bring together individuals in an environment that fosters and is supportive of their activist endeavors, as well as creating a safe place for living. House decisions are made by group-modified consensus. Community meals are vegetarian with a vegan option. We are located near Phoenix, Lothlorien, Ambrosia, Nottingham, and Rivendell Co-ops. 

House members contribute roughly 5-6 hours of their time each week for work jobs such as cooking, washing dishes, cleaning various common spaces, paying bills, grocery shopping, serving as a house representative for the board and various committees of Madison Community Cooperative, and many other jobs that go toward the upkeep and continuance of the household.

Everyone in the house pays $95 a month to purchase bulk food that is mostly organic and locally grown when possible; we strive to buy from vendors that are owned and run by people of color and/or women. A vegan or vegetarian meal is cooked every night of the week around 7 p.m., except on Saturdays.  

We have house meetings every other Sunday night that can last anywhere from forty-five minutes to three hours. These meetings are a chance for us to communicate with one another as a group about any issues, problems, plans, or changes, in a forum that insures everyone an equal chance to be heard.

&quot;The Solar Community Housing Association (SCHA) is committed to providing low-income cooperative housing that works to confront and critique systems of oppression through ecological awareness, inclusive self-governance and alternative economic models.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sunwise-co-op/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sunwise-co-op/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Sunwise co-op is an eight-bedroom, passive solar house in suburban Davis, California. It belongs to the larger organization of the Solar Community Housing Association. Our house is located on a greenbelt with a large garden, bees, and chickens. The members of our house are both students and professionals (all low income) who share the roles of maintaining the house, working together towards many goals including social justice, environmentally conscious living, and education. We also share meals, chores, stories, toothpaste, and our time. We make consensus-based decisions during house meetings in order to ensure that all members of the household are heard and appreciated. The house welcomes applicants who are open to a diverse household working together to live consciously.

In Native American mythology, the dolphin represents the combination of heaven and Earth, spirituality and matter, vision and realization. We are already living communally in this sense, in a small communal home and others living within 10 kilometers. In our spiritual diversity, communal singing, eating, hiking, baby-sitting, decision making by consensus, and solving conflicts, we are learning from the experiences of older communities and are passing on our own experiences through the Ökodorf-Institute: consultations, festivals, a mail-order business, and seminars on searching for and founding communities. Regarding service to fellow human beings, at the moment we are supporting the establishment of free schools in Africa. We are friends with several dozen local residents and are in friendly contact with others. South Black Forest considers itself something of a melting pot, since southern and eastern Europeans have been working in the textile industry here for over 150 years. In the long run, we would like to establish a spiritual-ecological village in addition to being integrated into the existing village and region. This new village will probably be close by and will make it easier to become self-sufficient. We would like to build the village together with a regional network of friends of our community. As a first step in this direction, we have established a local labor-exchange system (Wiesentaler instead of Euro), and we will use the Artabana health community instead of health insurance.

We trust that God/inner voice will guide us in deciding what to do next, just as we have been guided so well since 1995. People interested in joining should first send us a page about themselves and their vision. We will then send more information about ourselves as well.

In 2009 we have been searching to buy a farm in Germany or near it with some hectares to plant our own vegetables, etc. We also want to grow our community in such a way that we can help old, dying members to die in a good way, inside our community.

Beyond that we do not define ourselves by what we eat, believe or do; though individual members do have various strains of activism, spirituality, dietary ethics and personal codes central to their lives.  Tolerance and understanding are way more important than signing up to any particular code.  Be yourself, but be enough of a grown up to have thought about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/earthworm-housing-co-op/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/earthworm-housing-co-op/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Once a commune, now a co-housing project with a shared house in the middle, Earthworm Housing Co-operative owns three residential buildings and seven acres of land on the border of Shropshire, Hereford and Powys. 

We make decisions through regular meetings and on a day-to-day basis always by consensus. The group's membership and direction have undergone several changes since the co-operative was formed in 1989, but the same original principles and ideals remain, including an ecological focus, managing land for resilience, productivity and health, limiting use of products that poison and pollute, and trying to be more ethical consumers.

We farm our land by organic methods, using techniques from fields as diverse as bio-dynamics, permaculture and old-boy allotment-style! We use composting toilets and have recently built a wetland  system to process sewage, greywater and wastewater from the house. We grow seasonal vegetables, herbs, and fruit in the gardens, polytunnels and greenhouse.

Vegans, meat-eaters and people in between all share space, collaborating and communicating clearly and well.
  
We host some gatherings, courses, and camps, but mostly members are just getting on quite conventionally, making their livlihoods in our border region.  

Some members are parents, some are growers, some are brewers and some are teachers.  Our origins include Germany as well as Ireland, England and Scotland.  The co-op has had literally hundreds of members since it was legally constituted in 1989, but has been quite stable since 2011, focusing on the renovation of all the buildings.

It began as a 'commune' in 1975, and many waves of people have contributed to the abundance and challenges we now enjoy as a productive, outward-looking housing co-operative.</description>

On the edge of the town of Crediton in Devon 5 residents live in a semi-detached Georgian house bought by Corani in 2013. In Leicester two residents live in a terraced Victorian house bought by Corani in 1996. Three other members, not currently housed by Corani, live elsewhere in Leicester.
The Crediton house has a large garden around it in which we grow as many fruits, vegetables and herbs as we can, whilst leaving enough space to play football with the dog. We have chickens and a homemade beehive with a successful colony that produces delicious honey.
We aim to live as sustainably as we can in our current situation; The Leicester house has installed solar panels and the Crediton house have ongoing work making the house as insulated as possible.
The Corani members in each house share all communal living spaces and food and eat together every evening. In Crediton a casual cooking rota means that everyone cooks at least once a week. Decision making is essentially pragmatic: by consensus where all are concerned, otherwise with sensitive autonomy.
Things some or all of us like to do are: being outside, growing things, making things, carpentry, plumbing, playing music, dancing, climbing rocks and mountains, camping, bird watching, promoting sustainability, promoting devolved government.
We don’t currently have the capacity to take on new members, but may wish to do so in the future, so if you would like to learn more about Corani then please do get in touch.</description>

Starland is a campground/retreat center located in a Southern California high desert setting near Joshua Tree. It is run by a resident and non-resident community. Residents live in their own trailers or cabins and share common facilities. 

Our facilities are available for group retreats, workshops or other events as well as for individual visitors. We are located on 10 scenic and private acres. Facilities include a 27’X36′ assembly hall, a lodge house with a kitchen, dining room, lounge, sleeping room and rest rooms, a large outdoor dining patio, a hot tub, labyrinth, shower building, dome, hiking trails, several cabins and trailers and ample space for tents and RV’s.

We are ideal for events with 20-50 participants.

We serve as a Southern California home base for Network for a New Culture, Radical Faeries, Burning Man and other groups and organizations. We are affiliated with the Shadow Mountain Cohousing community in nearby Joshua Tree.

We use the vital tools of truth-speaking, pattern-breaking, awareness and attunement exercises, threaded through with the basics like honor, respect. The talking circle is our forum. The wild herbs are our healers. The Earth is our Mother. All the creatures of the land are our guides. 

Our primitive camp, Nishnajida--a cluster of bark-and-thatch wigwams--lies five miles from our office center. There, we guide the yearlong Wilderness Guide Program where students from all over the world come to make their clothing from skins; fish and forage for food; make craft items like bows, bowls, spoons, baskets; learn how to track, how to build, inhabit, and maintain lodges.  Most of all, students learn about themselves and how to genuinely live as a clan. Everyone in our community is involved with the maintenance of this program, as well as with our own personal projects, passions, and growth. 

A second primitive camp, Mashkodens, is our living-learning center where experienced staff members live and Wilderness Guide Program graduates come for extended internships in native lifeway. Mashkodens serves as a doorway where people from all over can come to experience the Old Way as it is actually lived in our contemporary context, for one to three months at a time. 

Walking in the footsteps of the natives who were here before us, our programs are semi-nomadic, with winter and summer lodges at our primitive camps and temporary seasonal camps for activities such as fishing, wild ricing, and leek-gathering at various locations. Those at our support/office/administrative center join in these seasonal activities as well. 

At the support center we live in wood-stove heated cabins, use electricity, computers, cars, and telephones, but our approach is to live as simply and closely to the Earth Mother as possible. Many of us do not use indoor toilets, and we have limited bathing facilities, but we do have running water in a couple of our homes. We purchase local organic food, scavenge and fish for our wild meat, and forage for some of our summer fruits and greens, and nuts.  

Information about open positions, volunteer opportunities, internships, classes, and the Wilderness Guide Program are available from our website. 

We are a pet-free, alcohol/tobacco/drug-free community.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22168&quot;&gt;Hummingbird Transformational Living Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; A family of pioneering souls whose vision is to cultivate a joyful, vibrant, co-creative culture in service to the evolution of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/hummingbird-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/hummingbird-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Hummingbird Community is located on 500 acres of lush land nestled against the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of northern New Mexico. We began as a non-local community within Global Family bonding through our extensive international peace and educational work. Global Family, founded in 1986, is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization affiliated with the United Nations whose purpose is to support a shift in consciousness from separation and fear to unity, love, and cooperation.

As social pioneers, we share a commitment to the principles and practices of co-creation. Since founding Hummingbird in 1996, we have grown into a diverse group of 22 deeply connected core members who support one another in fulfilling each of our souls’ purpose.

Hummingbird Community is one of four primary aspects of our overarching organization, the Hummingbird Center for a Co-Creative World (www.hummingbirdcenterforacocreativeworld.com):
- Global Family
An international network of individuals and groups who choose to experience themselves as members of one human family and who desire to actualize their life purpose through joining with others in compassionate action for the benefit of all.
- Hummingbird Community
As social pioneers, our Community is dedicated to the practices and principles of co-creation in service to the evolution of consciousness. We honor diverse spiritual traditions, and are committed to personal and planetary transformation. 
- Hummingbird Living School
The educational programs of HBLS are designed to give people the understanding, information and skills necessary to be a leader in the pioneering adventure of bringing forth a profoundly healthy and loving world.
- Hummingbird WellNest
A premier wellness center for those who desire a renewed sense of wellbeing and balance. We value personal relationships, emotions, beliefs, meanings and the connections these have to the body, mind, spirit and all of humanity. 

We invite others to join us in our living laboratory of discovery where Source and Nature guide us to co-create a new world.

      <name>Kalani Oceanside Retreat</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22190&quot;&gt;Kalani Oceanside Retreat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Kalani was founded by two professional artists, Earnest Morgan and Richard Koob, MFA, former Hawai'i State Arts Coordinators, and University of Hawai'i instructors versed in dance, drama, painting, drawing, music, Hawaiian, African, Asian and European cultural arts, and yoga. Since Kalani's beginning in 1975, many culture and arts forms have been and continue to be celebrated in the annual and weekly ongoing events.

Kalani's property was at one time a traditional ahupua'a, or land portion, that was cared for by an `ohana, or extended family, who benefited from its stewardship. A halau, or Hawaiian cultural school, graced the ocean frontage of Kalani until 1900. This site, with its paths, lava walls and smooth stone floor, is preserved along with a heiau (temple) site and burial grounds.

In the 1870's, Hawaii's beloved monarch, Kalākaua, reinstated the practice of hula after years of suppression from the missionaries. A renaissance of Hawaiian culture has continued ever since, celebrated annually in Hilo's Merrie Monarch Festival, during which Kalani holds the Puna Music Festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kalani-oceanside-retreat/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kalani-oceanside-retreat/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Kalani is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational retreat center and eco-community in Hawai‘i Island’s colorful Puna District, and a premiere destination for over 40 years. Kalani hosts individual retreats, group workshops, sabbatical, and community life experiences in on-site accommodations that range from off-grid campsites to eco-cottages constructed from sustainably harvested wood and bamboo.

Kalani is great for year-round personal getaways or group retreats (up to 125)! Kalani is the only coastal lodging facility within the Aloha State's largest conservation area.

One of Kalani’s guiding principles is to preserve and enhance our pristine, 120-acre campus and surrounding Puna District through sustainable education programs and hands-on community participation. To that end, Kalani has become a living model for discovering and implementing best practices in permaculture, sustainability, and community development in a breathtaking tropical oasis. For all the latest happenings on our lively campus, check out our Blog or follow us on Facebook and Instagram!

Nearby are thermal springs, a black sand beach visited by dolphins and whales, orchid farms, snorkel tidal pools, steam bathing, waterfalls, botanical gardens, historic villages, and spectacular Volcanoes National Park.

Kalani is expanding its facilities beginning in 2007 and is accepting a limited number of new investors and residents.

Accommodations for up to 60 guests are available. We also have camping available in addition to indoor lodging. Delicious vegetarian meals are included in the reasonable lodging rates.

We feature regular programs focused on reaching a better understanding of ones physical, mental and spiritual potential.  Various applications of the science of yoga are explored in a practical and scholarly manner. Our future vision is for these programs to evolve into a Yoga University.

We were founded by Yogacharya J. Oliver Black, a direct disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda. For over 40 years our focus has been to help people commune with their inner presence through yogic meditation. Ongoing services include our weekly Sunday service and evening meditation. 

A river flows through this beautiful location, which features a network of trails and scenic overlooks. With a friendly staff to help guests enjoy their stay, we offer a rare opportunity for visitors to experience spiritual rest and relaxation in a supportive and nourishing environment.

We are also blessed with the growing Clear Light Community, which is populated by full-time residents who have chosen to build homes here and grow with us at Song of the Morning.

Come, my friends, let us taste peace in holy foods forever; smell peace in wild baby herbs planted where unloved weeds grow; hear and feel its ode to joy from the mouth of earth-like Angels as we dare to dance with water hoses. --Leslie Goldman, Your Enchanted Gardener

Eight of us live together on a one-third-acre parcel surrounded by canyons within  walking distance of the San Diego State College. The land exists to foster a healing relationship with nature, and help us each turn our beat around with nature through growing a bit of our own food, supporting local organic farmers, and living together.  The land  is an an oasis of green with many aromatic herbs and places to garden.The land calls for people who would like to live in an old home in the city and live as well in a natural environment suited to garden lovers. The garden is overgrown and needs a lot of helpers.

The library houses books and materials created by Leslie Goldman, founder, and works by his mentors, Bernard Jensen, natural healing arts elder, and Edmond Bordeaux Szekely, modern Essene renaissance pioneer. 

The house is In private ownership,   The house offers rental to those who would like to live as extended family and join in house meetings and shared house duties. Each person does 12 hours or more of work per month, or pays higher rent.  Additional Every Day Upkeep is also asked.

      <name>The Phoenix Cooperative House</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22214&quot;&gt;The Phoenix Cooperative House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Egalitarian Social Living&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-phoenix-cooperative-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-phoenix-cooperative-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Phoenix Co-op currently houses 26 members -- both students and professionals with a range of different ages -- bringing a diverse and family-like environment to our co-op. We are located close to the Memorial Union and State Street in a spacious 1920s French chateau-style building. The house features original woodwork, a fancy spiral staircase, and a frequently-used fireplace.
 
Phoenix uses a modified consensus decision-making process - everyone's voice is heard, and decisions are made democratically. We look for committed members who have a serious interest in living cooperatively as well as a desire to contribute your experience and energy to the house, even if you are just staying for the summer.
 
We proudly stand behind MCC’s mission of creating a healthy and safe space for every member, regardless of their background or identity. Our goal as a cooperative house is to create a sustainable and empowering community for all who want to partake in it, as well as offering low-income housing to Madison as a whole.
 
*Unfortunately, Phoenix is not wheelchair accessible.

      <name>Friends' Cooperative House</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22215&quot;&gt;Friends' Cooperative House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Cooperative Living, Community&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/friends-cooperative-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/friends-cooperative-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
437 W. Johnson Street has been home to Friends' Cooperative since 1967, although our history begins a year earlier when a local chapter of the Society of Friends (Quakers) sponsored the creation of a housing co-op on the corner of Brooks and University. Our name, Friends', our moment of silence before house dinners, and our commitment to consensus attest to our Quaker roots, even though none of the current members are active Quakers. 
Our co-op is based on a principle of acceptance of people's differences. All it takes to become a member is a willingness to take part in the cooperative effort that keeps the house running. In addition, we have policies in place that emphasize an environmentally-friendly lifestyle.

Our 13 residents include undergraduates, graduate students, and working people. The age range is often quite large.  

We want to place special emphasis on creating a strong and tight-knit community. We aim to do this with a house retreat at the beginning of the school year and some organized house outings in addition to the informal social activities.

Benefits of living at Friends:

•	Cooperative living.

•	Great location. The heart of campus and the Capitol are each just a five-minute walk away.

•	Eat what you want. Living in Friends' makes it easy to eat what you want to eat, whether you are a vegetarian, vegan, or meat eater. Friends also emphasizes organic and locally grown foods.

•	Family-like atmosphere. Our house is small enough to allow members to form close relationships with everyone they live with. Our dining room, cozy living room, and five porches are very popular spots for spontaneous hanging out.

•	Free washer and dryer.

•	Local calls are included in your room charge. Friends has a phone line that everyone shares. You are also free to buy your own phone line for your room.

•	Free wireless DSL.

Located in Seattle, we enjoy many benefits of city living, including a wide range of friends and interests outside our home: Quaker meeting, music, environmental and social justice organizations, and the Northwest Intentional Community Association, among others. We share chores, food, mostly vegetarian meals, and meet regularly, making decisions by consensus. Our workdays honor the continued well-being of our home, and our celebrations recognize the Light within each of us. Occasionally one of us spontaneously bursts into song. We began in Philadelphia in 1979 via the Life Center as two couples (gay and straight) combining incomes and co-parenting three children. In 1985 we moved to Seattle and eventually bought a large, airy house. Although members have come and gone over the years, we are still committed to maintaining a pleasant, cooperative, multicultural and nurturing environment for personal growth and social activism. Our &quot;Solar Plan&quot; is now complete with our second solar energy installation. Two sets of solar panels produce large portions of our hot water and electricy. It's quite a thrill to see the electric meter running in reverse. Invited guests are welcome. Advance notice required.</description>

Madison Community Cooperative (MCC), founded in 1968, is a thriving housing cooperative consisting of about 200 members who collectively own and manage 11 cooperative houses. Our houses are located on Madison’s isthmus and range in size from 6 to 30 members.  

Each of our houses features individual bedrooms, shared bathrooms, and a large communal kitchen. Members at all of our houses are part of house level dining co-ops. Most of these dining co-ops are also open to members of the Madison community who are not members of MCC.

Our members are young and old, workers and students, parents and non-parents, and represent a diversity of ethnicities, national backgrounds, genders, and sexual orientations. The central mission of MCC is to improve the Madison community by providing low-cost, nonprofit cooperative housing for very low- to moderate-income people, and to be inclusive of underrepresented and marginalized groups.

MCC is run by our members at our bi-weekly Board of Directors meetings; bi-weekly Maintenance, Finance, and Membership Committee meetings; tri-annual General Membership meetings; and weekly house meetings. Each of our houses has its own unique culture and history and is entrusted with a high level of autonomy. Each of our houses is responsible for its house policies, membership process, work/job system, annual budget development, minor maintenance program, dining co-op, house meeting system, and designation of Board and committee representatives.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22223&quot;&gt;Edges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We work together to develop a more ecological, personally fulfilling, and just way of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/edges/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/edges/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
 For over 20 years, the Edges Community has evolved through many forms, serving as home and opportunity for diverse individuals, families and lifestyles as well as a refuge of biodiversity, holistic healing, off-grid living, and affordable housing. It has provided a place of entrepreneurship in alternative medicine, green building, organic agriculture, and renewable energy and offered educational opportunities in both permaculture and ecological awareness. Though many of Edges members, families, and businesses have come and gone, what remains is a small core of committed members with a social, financial, and governance structure backed by over two decades of learning and observation in community living. We are looking forward to the continuing story of our community and what it may offer future generations.

Edges is owned and operated as a land trust corporation, comprised collectively and equally of its members. Members own their houses, but the land property itself is held in trust, undivided and unparceled.

Though there are no property lines, members occupy and homestead their own personal area of land. The community seeks to balance privacy and autonomy with integrated community living and collective planning and decision-making. 

Our governance structure operates by “consensus minus-one”, though almost all our decisions are reached through full consensus, upholding simple core values of trust, respect, transparency, and open communication. 

Currently there are six core members, only four of which live on the land. The community is also home to other resident non-members and families, and continues to offer affordable housing options for alternatively minded individuals and couples who may or may not be interested in a long-term membership commitment.

Our membership process involves an extensive 7-month “provisional membership” period during which potential members live on the land and participate as if they were members, with several “check-ins” to discuss compatibility. 

Our community meets one weekend a month for an official meeting, work-day project, and meal. We benefit from several shared resources, including a laundry room, large chest-freezer, garage/workshop, tractor and bush-hog, riding mower, hauling trailer, 4x4 UTV, wood chipper, and small barn.

Our 94 acres is located near Athens, Ohio, in the foothills of Appalachia and unglaciated Ohio River Valley. Our land occupies one of the highest points in the county, serving as a watershed property for tributaries of the Federal and Sunday Creek. The diverse ridge top topography cradles many diverse micro-climates and habitats, from dry open meadows to mature diverse hardwood forests, swampy seeps and vernal pools to highly competitive new-growth forests. The land offers abundance in wild food and medicine, including persimmon, paw paw, elderberry, black walnut, blackberry and wild mushrooms. We have a half-acre pond. Delicious varieties of second and third generation apple trees speckle the property from an old orchard. Our meadows, rarely mowed, are pollinator havens as well as battlegrounds of highly competitive invasive species such as multi-flora rose, autumn olive, and Japanese honeysuckle. The land supports little fertile bottom land, but its dynamic forms in both topography and biodiversity offer enormous potential for a large-scale permaculture plan and integrated systems approach to food, medicine, and firewood production. 

Currently, we maintain personal gardens, harvest wild food, and keep several bee hives. 

We hope to attract creatively driven individuals to participate in and become part of an evolving community vision, one which is ecologically sensitive, which celebrates diversity and cooperation, one which respects privacy and self-reliance, but is empowered by co-dependence, collaboration, and trust.

Three Springs is an environmentally oriented, consensus-based community founded in 1993. We presently have 4 adult members and 2 children. Our primary focus is to share our land and strive to create healthy relationships with each other and all living things around us. We are excited about the communities movement and what it can do in a positive way for people and the Earth. As we gain experience, we share information and resources to help others.

We are located in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas, 45 miles northeast of Fresno and 30 miles southeast of Yosemite National Park. Our 160 acres is an idyllic, peaceful, rural setting with a diversity of native plants and animals. A year-round creek with waterfalls, swimming holes, and rock formations runs through our land, and thousands of acres of national forest are adjacent to us. The land is owned by a mutual benefit nonprofit corporation. 

We believe in living lightly on the land, which we define as sustenance (growing and harvesting some of our own food), shelter (working with environmentally oriented architecture), social and spiritual (developing and nurturing healthy relationships). Please feel free to write.

Earthaven is an aspiring ecovillage founded in 1994 on 329 acres in the mountain forests of western North Carolina, about 50 minutes from Asheville. We are spiritually diverse, and value sustainable ecological systems, permaculture design, elegant simplicity, right livelihood, and healthy social relations. We have both vegetarians and omnivores, and some of us raise livestock for food. We hope to become empowered, responsible, ecologically literate citizens who model bioregionally appropriate culture for our time and place.

We intend to become a village of at least 150. We use a modified form of the N Street Consensus Method for decision making, and have paid for and own title to our land. We are in the process of restructuring our legal arrangements, and we pay annual dues. As of 2016 we have 51 members. We have built roads and bridges, community buildings, members' homes, multi-household residences, gardens, constructed wetlands, and off-grid power and water systems.

We are developing a small village-scale economy. Some of us work in small, onsite businesses or nonprofits owned or run by members, including Useful Plants Nursery; Culture's Edge, an educational nonprofit; the School of Integrated Living (SOIL), an educational nonprofit); or by offering services such as tours, campground lodging, carpentry and home construction, home care, child care, and healing arts. 

As a learning community dedicated to sharing our resources with the public, we offer workshops in Permaculture design, natural building, consensus decision-making, Sociocracy, creating new ecovillages, herbal medicine, health and healing, and women’s mysteries. We also host large events such as the Continental Bioregional Congress (2005), the annual Southeast Regional Permaculture Gathering (2002-04), and a Village Harvest Festival (2008-2009) We welcome students and other learning groups, and support homeschool parents of children at Earthaven and nearby. We are seeking hardworking, entrepreneurial  people, including but not  limited to organic growers and farmers; people with solar system, electrical, plumbing, and mechanical skills; healers, artists, and families with children.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22231&quot;&gt;Niche / Tucson Community Land Trust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; enjoying life together, sustainability,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/niche-tucson-community-land-trust/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/niche-tucson-community-land-trust/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are four adults, plus at least one short-term adult,  3 dogs, and uncounted roadrunners, woodpeckers, lizards, bunnies, and other wildlife living on roughly two acres of gardens, fruit trees and native open space in central Tucson.
We share a five bedroom 2 1/2 bath home. 
We are rural, yet centrally located. It's a 15 minute bike ride from down town. This is a more rustic environment, with lots of opportunity to create your own space and projects. Our home has a variety of natural building features, including strawbale construction and poured adobe floors.

We are seeking eco-friendly, responsible, fun community members to join us in expanding this peaceful, growing community. 

If you are looking for sustainability, self-sufficiency, alternative building, gardens, permaculture, and friendship, this may be the place for you.

New community members are decided upon after meeting everyone in the household. Our intention is to build relationships to ensure a good long term situation for everyone.

If you are interested in visiting and finding out more, please tell us a bit about yourself, including any previous community experience and what your interests are. 

*Responsible *Motivated *Spiritual * Non religious * Dog friendly *Child friendly * Participatory * TV Free * Permaculture * Gardening * Home improvement *Community * Sustainability * Self sufficiency * Clear and open communication * Bike culture
If any of this sounds like you, give us a call or email.

This is a non-smoking household and we discourage more pets (they can be hard on the wildlife) but we will consider a well behaved pet already attached to a great potential community member.

Some of us are meditators.

Thank you.

      <name>Penington Friends House</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22240&quot;&gt;Penington Friends House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To create a space where people can live simply in concert with Quaker values and through diversity and the tasks of daily life learn to listen quietly and appreciate that of God in everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/penington-friends-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/penington-friends-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;   Our house derives its special quality from the people who live here, an evolving population of men and women of various ages and cultural backgrounds. There are about 25 of us- Artists, students, working professionals and retired people- who have come together to enjoy simple, comfortable living at a reasonable cost. Preference is given to Friends and those people involved in socially responsible concerns, as we support people who are dedicated to making valuable contributions toward world peace, our planet and each other.The Penington’s ample common space and shared meals provide a wonderful opportunity to get to know a wide range of people. Our dinners are simple, but delicious. Our chefs purchase many organic or locally grown ingredients and provide both vegetarian and non-vegetarian entrees.  
   Everyone shares in the housework, which consists of housekeeping details, dining room chores and bathroom cleaning.  Participation in these duties is an integral part of PFH and vital to both its physical existence and spiritual core of sharing, service, and community life.  Residents are asked to participate on various committees for decision making within the house and to make every effort to attend dinner together.   It cannot be emphasized too strongly that residency at PFH depends upon a healthy, responsible attitude of cooperation and contribution.
     We also have 2 overnight guest rooms for Friends traveling through the city.  These can be rented for up to 2 weeks.  guest room reservation information can be found on our website.</description>

      <name>Du•ma</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22245&quot;&gt;Du•ma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The mission of Duma is to demonstrate a more sustainable and fulfilling way of living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/du%e2%80%a2ma/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/du%e2%80%a2ma/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Du•má is a close-knit group of seven to nine people living together in a beautiful old home on a quiet residential neighborhood in Eugene just south of the University of Oregon.

People of all ages have lived at Duma--from newborn to seniors.  During the day people are typically at work or school and in the evening come together to enjoy vegetarian dinners.   We share our living expenses (but not our incomes), nurture our relationships with one another, and share the joys and responsibilities of taking care of our large home.

We have a large lot with an impressive garden that includes fruit trees, berry vines, vegetables, flowers, and herbs.  We also have solar panels, a sauna, hot tub, beehive, cob oven, and a chicken coop.

Du•má began as a vision of several people who lived together collectively in the late 1980s. They aspired to buy a home that could be a model of both sustainability and community. The first eight members began living together in 1990. Over the years dozens of people have lived at Du•má–-some for just a few months and others for many years.  

One-by-one every room in the house was renovated, windows replaced, and wood floors re-finished.  The gravel parking lot in back was removed and replaced with fruit tress, vegetables, and a deck.

Visitors often remark that we are neat, well organized, and accountable to one another. They notice the many little touches that make our home beautiful and notice that we usually get along well with each other.  Visitors who share dinner with us comment on our scrumptious meals.

While the founders aspired to have everyone become a co-owner, the responsibility and stamina required to hold a collective vision, nurture community, and be a homeowner was more than most people were able to commit to.  Over time, members of the core group moved on to other things and by 2009 only one member of the core group remained. 

Du•má is now a unique private/collective hybrid with private ownership and shared day-to-day decisions about food, events, etc.  With one owner there's a clear line of accountability, less work, and shorter meetings, but the trade-off is less group autonomy.  

Visitors are welcome to stay on a night-by-night basis for up to 3 nights. Please contact us at least one week in advance to make arrangements.  

From time to time we are looking for people to live with us.  We have a strong preference for people who will live here for a year or more. If this arrangement appeals to you please be in touch.</description>

      <name>Songaia Cohousing Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22248&quot;&gt;Songaia Cohousing Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Songaia Neighborhood strives to collaboratively create a vibrant, rewarding, and sustainable community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/songaia-cohousing-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/songaia-cohousing-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Songaia Neighborhood is located about 20 miles north of Seattle, where our 17 homes are surrounded by a small forest, organic gardens, orchards, and a meadow.  Our multi-generational community was established in 1993 and is still expanding; we currently have about 40 residents and are recruiting for the purchase and development of additional land.  Songaia is well-known for our activism within the communities movement, and we welcome others who aspire to have a connected and sustainable lifestyle.

Our community life is active; we gather for five shared meals per week and celebrate, work, and pursue learning together. As a result of these many connections, we have grown to be a strong web of friends and neighbors.  We have an ethical commitment to hearing all voices in our community and therefore use a consensus decision-making process and rotational leadership. In community processes, we aim to create a space that is a supportive environment for people of all ages, backgrounds, and interests.  

The Songaia Neighborhood is actually composed of multiple intentional communities.  Our original property is the Songaia Cohousing Association, but over the last few years we have expanded to include two additional communities; Life Song Commons and New Earth Song.  That being said, for most practical purposes we function as a single unit.  The Songaia Cohousing Association has 13 member-owned 1-to-3-bedroom duplex units (including several studio apartments) which are clustered around a common green space. New Earth Song is in the process of developing their half-acre with a single-family house into seven residential units. Life Song Commons is located on 1.3 acres with a large house and small cottage, and functions as a shared household. We are planning to grow our neighborhood, so if you might be interested in joining us please visit our website for more information.

Our desire for sustainability inspires us to share resources and skills whenever possible.  Members and Associates (including non-residents) have access to our extensive facilities and land. The common house includes eating and meeting spaces, two guest rooms, laundry facilities, a playroom for our children and much more. Our barn has a greenhouse, food pantries, tool shop (woodworking, electrical, auto), ceramics room, and storage. The land includes a small forest, wetlands, several organic gardens, two orchards, a central lawn, and a meadow.

We also aim to connect with local, regional, and national communities.  Because of our work to create self-sustaining food sources on our property, we have become involved in the local permaculture and organic agriculture movements. Our community is also devoted to education; we host a vibrant internship program that attracts volunteers through WWOOF, Bastyr University, and University of Washington Bothell. Songaia has provided land and support for the Rites of Passage Journeys, which runs programs that connect people to the wilderness and assist them in life transitions. Additionally, we are active participants in the regional and national intentional communities movement.

      <name>Vine &amp; Fig Tree Farm/Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22249&quot;&gt;Vine &amp; Fig Tree Farm/Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our primary focus: nonviolently sustainable and cooperative simple living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/vine-fig-tree-farmcommunity/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/vine-fig-tree-farmcommunity/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The original Vine &amp; Fig Tree was formed in 1986 as a land-based community with a vision of people living “in loving Gandhian nonviolence among ourselves and with all creation.” This community was successful in many ways (11 adults and kids at peak, two home-birthed children, growing a lot of our own food, hosting peace/justice gatherings, etc) but dissolved in 2000 due to a combination of factors, divorce of the couple who held title to the land, members deciding to move to town to be closer to work and/or schools, etc.

Three of us are now inviting people to join us in re-establishing the community on about 60 acres of the same land, holding to the same basic vision but with new emphasis on dirt-level sustainability, shaking off our culture’s addiction to high-energy lifestyles and learning, as we are able, how to live on current solar income. We are especially interested in attracting people who want to engage in sustainable/organic farming or at least grow a large share of their own food, individually and/or cooperatively, and who want to build their own low-impact housing.

We have in mind a land trust type ecovillage planned according to permaculture principles. Our idea is for members to own their own housing, with assurance of tenure and right of inheritance and sale, but to take the land off the real estate market. Those who come in first will help determine details of the community structure and process with regard to cost-sharing, land use, decision-making, etc. We prefer consensus decision making and assume members will be enthusiastically committed to cooperative living and mutual support in work and play. We think it is important for us to be good citizens of the surrounding unintentional community and find opportunities to develop cooperative relationships with our neighbors. We also hope our community will to some extent become a model learning and service center for others (which could also be another source of income for individuals and/or the community).

The name Vine &amp; Fig Tree comes from Scripture (Micah 4, “and every one ‘neath their vine and fig tree, shall live in peace and unafraid”) and conveys a sense of our fundamental vision. This does not mean we intend to be a &quot;religious&quot; community. We are open to members of any (or no) faith tradition and believe that joyously celebrating authentic spiritual traditions and the arts are as important as sustaining physical life.</description>

We're a group of students, artists, activists, and others who share food, fun, and friendship in our three old houses. We cook vegetarian/vegan homemade food and dine together most nights. Members participate by cooking (once every few weeks), by doing a chore (from shopping for organic produce to vacuuming), and by coming to weekly meetings. We also work on the house together, doing minor maintenance with our own people power.

Our houses are great for people new to the area--or anyone sick of the apartment blues. We are a diverse community accepting of many different lifestyles. It's a terrific situation for those seeking community, a chance to gain new skills and to share with others. We are in Chicago, near the University of Chicago, and close to the downtown loop. If you're interested, give a call or write email. We'd love to have you over for dinner!

Its members of all ages currently live in large multifamily homes and apartment buildings in Evanston and the Rogers Park neighborhood of northern Chicago.  

Reba’s calling is “to extend the mission of Jesus by being a community of love and discipleship, and by nurturing other such communities as God gives us grace.” Practically, this has meant sharing resources and needs through a common treasury, living within walking distance of each other, developing and maintaining affordable housing, sponsoring a Monday night potluck and seminar for students and neighbors, welcoming visitors, and supporting the healthy growth of new Christian communities. Fellowship members work in shared ministries and in “outside” earning jobs, mostly in the service professions.

Growing relationships with local universities, an expanding intern program, and an influx of younger members are renewing Reba’s vision and forming leaders for the next generation of Christian community.</description>

Collectively owning our old Victorian house means freedom from landlord-imposed restrictions, but also means more responsibility for maintenance. We take turns cooking dinner and have bi-weekly house meetings. We share the evening meal, which is primarily vegan and organic. We compost all kitchen waste in our lovely little garden, share appliances and tools, and are a bike-friendly household. We also value being open and honest.

As the last of the original founders, a retired house remodeler, I am moving out of my home of 44 years into mor eappropriate housing for a senior.
I hope to see this house continue as a community, so I am trying to help the process, but it needs to happen immediately.

I sold this house. The new owner defaulted, it will be auctioned soon.
The house next door will be placed on the market sometime in the next year.

The appraised value for this house is $1,175,000 and would probably sell for more if listed on the open market. I am offering this house for $1,100,000 fixed price. Please inquire for more information about this house.
 
The house itself has been improved to accommodate collective living. Green features include extensive insulation, wood-burning stove with a catalytic converter, solar hot water tank, and photovoltaic panels on the roof. The rich dense soil has been improved with composting since 1972. Perennial crops include raspberries, apples, figs, persimmons, pomegranate and herbs, as well as year-round vegetable beds.
 
We are in an active neighborhood group of two adjacent blocks with 148 households and no through traffic. Additionally, there are other seniors in the immediate neighborhood interested in selling (over the next several years) to households committed to “shared-living.”  Potential options to buy include three single family houses and one 4-plex on the same block.</description>

1) we have the freedom and opportunity to grow and flourish though living our individual and collective dreams, and
2) where we share a commitment to cooperating with, understanding, respecting and caring for one another, the land, its inhabitants and the natural rhythm of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/morninglory/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/morninglory/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a village of separate households of single people and families scattered over 100 hilly wooded acres. We homestead in varying degrees, living off-grid using some solar electricity and heating with wood. We grow organically much of our fruits and vegetables; some eggs and meat. We've spent 46 years learning how to be good neighbors, which has been a worthwhile process.

Most of our children were home birthed and are homeschooled; ages two years to nineteen. Swimming in our pond, trampolining, tobogganing, snowshoeing, new-moon women's circles, music jams, and potlucks are some of the things we do for fun. We all share a love of nature and the arts.

A multi-generational community, we are all involved with the surrounding and supportive rural community in varying degrees. 

Guests are welcome if they arrange in advance and help out while they're here.  Please write us describing who you are and why and when you would like to visit us. Also please let us know what skills and experience you would like to contribute to the community, and what you would like to learn here.

      <name>Magic</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22283&quot;&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Valuescience for common good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/magic/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/magic/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Magic is a residential service-learning community. Some residents operate an educational, charitable organization by the same name.

We establish the Magic community and the service organization upon a yet-to-be widely recognized connection between science and value: Ideas about value entail prediction; science is the sole demonstrated means for making predictions better than can be made by chance.

We perceive that valuescience is key to accurately discerning and realizing value. Magic residents and friends who sustain the service organization are aiming to improve our own and others' lives by honing valuescience practice and contributing to others' doing so.

Readers wary of &quot;science&quot; may be reassured to learn that we are also deeply &quot;religious&quot; in a literal sense (re- = again and lig- = connect). We see ecological science as the basis for unifying religion, with which people from diverse backgrounds can reconnect to other humans, other life, Earth, and cosmos.

Core themes in Magic community life and public services are: (1) valuescience; (2) health/awareness; (3) cooperation; and (4) stewardship. We view the Magic community as both laboratory and demonstration. We're aiming to ever more fully &quot;walk our talk.&quot;

Magic services to the general public include lectures and seminars about valuescience; life-planning workshops; swimming, running, bicycling, and hatha yoga instruction; youth mentoring; mediation; community organizing; planting and caring for trees and other vegetation; water- and land-management planning and advocacy; neighborhood design; and publishing.

Though few in numbers, we address diverse issues at many levels and in an integrated way. We do groundbreaking research, results of which we've published in top-tier scientific journals. We also perform hands-on demonstration projects. For example, we've established thousands of native oaks and tens of thousands of perennial understory plants on public-access open space nearby, and we've reconfigured streets in several neighborhoods to reduce short-cutting and vehicle speeds. Our research and demonstration projects have received national and international recognition for excellence in fields ranging from environmental law to dispute resolution.

We aim to strike a balance between utilizing the extraordinary resources of our Stanford University/Silicon Valley surroundings and maintaining contemplative, modest lives. We welcome opportunities to meet new people and to explore how we may interact to mutual benefit.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22285&quot;&gt;Laurieston Hall Housing Co-operative Ltd.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; collectivity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/laurieston-hall/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/laurieston-hall/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
This co-operative of around 18 people adults is now embarking on its fifth decade. We live in and around a huge Edwardian main house, with its walled garden, stables and cottages, surrounded by 135 acres of beautiful woods, pastures and marshland which stretch to a loch in the north. Trees we planted are now being coppiced. Living spaces use wood for heating and cooking. A hydro supplies much of our electricity.

In 2016 from Easter to October we run a programme of events (music, self-help, creative, gay, etc.), called The People Centre, which brings up to 70 extra people a week. We grow as much fruit and vegetables as we can, keep cows, pigs, hens and bees, and do most of our own maintenance. All of us pay a large portion of our rent in unwaged labour for the co-op. This means ideally spending about two and a half days a week doing what we call “workshare”. 

Issues that affect everybody come to a weekly co-op meeting in which decisions are made by consensus. Co-operation is our common ideology; under that umbrella we lean this way and that, are generally better at dealing with tomorrow than next year, are supportive of each other as individuals as well as co-op members... and we try to have a good time!

There are several ways of visiting us. You can book on a People Centre event; you can come on a Maintenance Week, (there are only three per year, so book early to avoid disappointment!).

Information and booking on either is via the newsletter - see below if you would like an e-copy.

You can also come as a working visitor. For a maximum of two weeks the first time, but longer once we know you. If you’re interested, email us at visitlh@gmail.com. 

For any other enquiries, or for an e-copy of our newsletter (which comes out in early January), please email enquirylh@gmail.com 

We are not actively seeking new members, but are not closed to them either. Joining this community can be a long process.

Go to www.FarmWellnessDay5K.org!!

&lt;div&gt;
The Lake Village farm was begun in 1971, dedicated to exploring a more sustainable environmental ethic. This extended-family commune occupies a mile-and-one-half of Long Lake's northeast shoreline, having grown to approximately 350 acres of forest, meadow, and farming space. Over the past 30 years there have been approximately 300 different people from all over the world who have participated in the Lake Village program. Today there are 50 members in all who are a part of this cooperative farm effort. Most members live on additional land purchased privately, bordering the Lake Village premises. Some members live off the farm while working there during the day. Others live on the commune and hold jobs in the greater Kalamazoo area as teachers, social workers, secretaries, wait staff, plumbers, roofers, counselors, and, of course, as students in the various area schools.

We consider ourselves a large extended family and are very much a part of the greater Kalamazoo community, which we hope is likewise dedicated to promoting an ecological, sustainable lifestyle--so that our children's children may enjoy the future blessings of a healthy Mother Earth. Welcome to our home and yours.

Our goal is to preserve and steward the land and collaborate in developing projects and programming, open to a diversity of women, that reflect our shared values of compassion, respect, stewardship, environmental sustainability, and love of the earth.

HOWL defines Intentional Community as a group of women with a shared set of values who are involved in furthering the HOWL mission by working together collaboratively, non-violent in words and actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/huntington-open-womens-land-howl/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/huntington-open-womens-land-howl/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Huntington Open Women's Land (HOWL) is a 50-acre land trust in northwestern Vermont established in 1987. HOWL is both an intentional community and Open Women's Land, which hosts events and welcomes visitors year round.  We currently have three residents and eight members on the Collective.  Our visitors' guidelines as well as our resident application procedures are on our website.  

We have an old farmhouse and barn.  The house has four bedrooms, kitchen, bath, and two common spaces. There is camping space on the land as well as a small pond.  

We love the land here and are dedicated to keeping it as a wildlife sanctuary and as a sanctuary for all womyn.  We have ongoing educational and social programs and enjoy many visitors throughout the year from local Vermont communities and around the world.  Please call or email ahead to arrange a visit.  We welcome and encourage visitors to stay for up to two weeks (sliding scale fees apply).

Heiwa was founded in 1985. Our current membership capacity is nine adults. We have two child members. We are a vegetarian household, and our membership tends to be environmentally conscious, politically active, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender celebratory, and musically inclined. Our home has often served as a meeting space for political and social-justice organizations, personal-growth groups, and community strengthening gatherings.
Over a period of fourteen years, we lived in four consecutive rental houses. In 1999, we purchased our current house, establishing a permanent location for Heiwa. In September of 2005, we expanded to an adjoining house. We dream about continued growth on our block, creating a cooperative neighborhood in northwest Ann Arbor.
Heiwa's mission statement is: to provide affordable cooperative housing for a diverse membership through cooperatively owned property, communal living, and resource sharing, while upholding principles of sustainability, peace, racial and economic justice, lifelong cooperative living, and involvement in local community.

We are located on 42 acres of wooded valley which is part of the School of Living community land trust. We believe that we have a responsibility to care for the land and each other, treating both with dignity and respect.

In community we support one another in living a life that we love. We don't currently have community businesses, so each member earns income individually and makes monthly contributions. We get together for evening meals most nights, weekly community meetings, regular meetings about relationship issues, monthly community work projects, and quarterly retreats. Many of us often gather for meditation, yoga, sing-alongs, celebrations, spiritual retreats, dances, world music drumming, and other events. All community decisions are made by consensus.

We strive to practice ever-more-sustainable ways of living. Our current projects focus on creating a living demonstration of permaculture principles and ecological sustainability, including the expansion of our organic gardens and the renovation of existing structures. We recently built an alternative, energy-efficient house with individual and family units, and renovating our 150-year-old grist mill to improve our shared spaces and conference center.

We welcome inquiries from people who share our passion for creating a better world, and hope to see you at one of our monthly visitor days.</description>

Camphill Village Kimberton Hills is one of 10 North American communities in the Camphill movement--each one unique, yet all with similar purposes. We seek to create a renewed village life and to establish healthy social forms of human interdependence. Our approach is based on the inspirations of Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy, which allows each person to evolve to their potential as a respected individual.
Started in 1972, our 432-acre agricultural and crafts community is run by 90 members, including some with developmental disabilities (autism, Down's syndrome, fragile X, and others). We have 12 houses that shelter &quot;extended families&quot; who work in the dairy, CSA garden, herb garden, orchard, bakery, fiber workshop, music workshop, pottery, and cafe. We have a strong cultural life that integrates art and music into our lives. Volunteers are welcome to share in our life and work for a year, or perhaps a lifetime. Our community sponsors an apprenticeship program in biodynamic agriculture, and training in fabric arts.

Our school also is licensed by the Pennsylvania Departments of Education and Public Welfare and we are a Pennsylvania Approved Private School for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities. We are part of the worldwide Camphill movement and the only Camphill community in North America for children.

When founded in 1963, The Camphill School was based upon the idea that the new community not only would become a village for children, but a place that nurtured childhood itself. This was powerfully affirmed in 1967 when a foundation stone was laid at Rock Crystal, the village’s first purposely built house where volunteers, interns, and children with intellectual and developmental disabilities could share their lives.</description>

To join forces/ funds/ resources  to purchase   land / old farmhouse / out buildings to set up an intentional, self-sustaining intentional community, with people of mixed ages, backgrounds and interests.
I'm a part Spanish, educator &amp;amp; maker interested in setting up a residential centre where paying guests can come and stay, access a range of arts &amp;amp; well-being courses within a rural tourism context.
A couple of us have been exploring the Granada &amp;amp; Alpujarras region to discover a cortijo ( farmhouse with land) to purchase and use as a base from which each of us can go on to build our own dwellings on communal land. Pooling resources together means we can afford a larger site with arrable land to grow on.
Currently based in Bristol, UK but intending to sell up to release finance. 
Seeking doers as opposed to mere dreamers to set up a viable project which could involve building our own homes using sustainable materials. 
If this is a lifestyle you would like to explore, do get in contact.</description>

We are a diverse group of people, striving for a more sustainable lifestyle and committed to building an organically evolving eco-community in rural Moldova. An important aspect of our community is a social and educational focus. 

Since 2014 we've built a residential eco-house for the first 2 pioneer families living on site and a straw-bale common house for public events and small-scale trainings (up to 25 participants). Two families are trying the co-housing model on site and another family built a wooden house with a thatched roof in the neighborhood. We hope these pioneer families would become an 'anchor' and a resource for future members interested to join and develop Eco-village Moldova. With that in mind, we are investing in public spaces for common activities and in organizing training events. In 2015 we've organized a number of   organic gardening and eco-construction workshops, as well as hosted interns and volunteers interested in sustainable lifestyle and community-building.

In 2016 we plan to build the Environmental Training Center (low or zero Carbon) with a capacity to host trainings for up to 50 participants at a time. Built from natural materials (wood, reed, clay, lime), the Center would have a big training room, dining area, well-equipped kitchen and some accommodation facilities for training participants and volunteers. Here we will hold practical workshops focused on environmental awareness and action, natural construction, eco-system restoration, and community building. 

As more families decide to join, our concept of community will be expanding to include more co-housing units and members living in eco-homes spread throughout the neighboring village, but sharing similar values and principles. For the cohousing units, we aim at small, but comfortable, energy efficient, affordable homes, built from natural materials with extensive shared facilities for adults and children. We are also trying to incorporate principles of permaculture in designing the green spaces between houses. 

In parallel with design and construction, we're still working on our group cohesion and developing internal structures and processes.

Some of the photos below are from one of our site visits during the summer of 2013. The others are from our experiments in eco-construction materials.

This is best expressed by the term Voluntary Simplicity or learning to live with less.  As I mentioned the second goal is to help heal the earth and each other.  Eventually this might include becoming a retreat center and offer programming for those interested.  The organic garden here produces lots of greens and other produce which helps provide healthy local food for our community.  The 1/5 acre garden can produce as much as 50 pounds of salad mixes, greens, onion, garlic and more weekly.  The garden is also a resource for those interested in learning to care for the earth and heal oneself through organically grown foods and working intimately with the environment. More on what it means to come here: 
Coweeta is a place of healing.  It pure spring waters, the sounds of water flowing, birds singing, clouds sailing by are music to your soul.  Coweeta is a place to get lost and found; tucked away in an intimate valley with little human activity.  It is the perfect place to rediscover who you are and your place in the natural world.  It is a place where cell phones don’t work and your watch may lose time.  It is a place to park your car and walk.  

Coweeta’s beyond organic gardens teach you to nurture yourself and the earth.  Each year tons of leaves are incorporated into the soil to feed the hordes of micro and macro organisms that feed the plants that are grown. Nourish your body and spirit with food you help grow and harvest.  

Coweeta’s gardens also help feed the local community and this is the perfect place to connect with folks and share the bounty of the earth and invite them to come to Coweeta to visit.  Coweeta is a place of sharing.

Coweeta is a place to gather your energies to do the work that nurtures your spirit and contributes to the good in the world whatever this may mean for you.  

Coweeta is a place of spirit, in the trees, rocks, animals, water and air.  Drink in the beauty and spirit here to nourish your soul.  Quiet your mind and be open to the spirit and energies of life around you.

Coweeta is also a place to engage in meaningful work.  With your hands you can help create a place of shelter, paths to walk on, beds to grow healthy food in, contributing to a welcoming community.  Yes, this takes work and some sweat and tears at times.

Coweeta is a place that will grow in you and you will grow in it.  Caring for something means that you become part of it.  This can be as simple as picking up branches that have fallen on roads or paths, building a rock wall that will last a century or more, gathering leaves for the garden each year to enrich the soil, or just sitting quietly in a spot you have chosen.  

Coweeta is a place to learn new things and apply what you learn to doing the “good work” of living simply so that others can simply live.  It is a place to learn to feed yourself from the earth.  

Coweeta is also a place of cleansing.  Of giving away habits that may keep you from living as free and healthy a life as you can.  Let the peace and quiet and companionship of the world fill your heart.  Give yourself entirely to the earth and it will fill your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/coweeta-heritage-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/coweeta-heritage-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Coweeta Heritage Center/Talking Rock Farm is a school, working farm and homestead.  Our goal at CHC is to help preserve the cultural history and natural beauty of this area. A second goal is to become a healing community for both the earth and each other.  I am looking for long term volunteers or permanent members.  Please contact me if you are  interested.  I will consider individuals as well as families. 
 
CHC are located in the Nantahalla Mountains of the eastern side of the Blue Ridge Mountains, 10 miles south of the town of Franklin, North Carolina (120 miles N.E. of Atlanta, GA and 70 miles west of Asheville, NC). The center's 32 acres lie in the heart of a small valley with a stream fed by numerous springs and surrounded by national forest. The stream provides water for our hydro-electric system. We are off-the-grid. The area is home to wild turkey, deer, bear, and has one of the largest diversities of plants anywhere in the world. Huge chestnut stumps, remains of 1800 log cabins, mill raceways, spring houses, century old farming roads, and old still sites, are reminders of a people and a way of life based on an intimate knowledge of the environment and those skills needed to survive. 

Paul is a former teacher of Industrial Arts and Technology Education and is well versed in woodworking. He is working on developing appropriate building techniques that incorporate the log construction styles of the past, as well as alternative energy systems. The center has its own saw mill to provide lumber for building projects which may eventually include cabins, a workshop, and a small conference center for retreats and programming. 

Daily life includes organic gardening, aquaculture (trout), basic building skills, wildcrafting, preserving foods, off the grid living, permaculture, crafts (wooden spoon production), saw milling, and other practical living skills for sustainable living.  I currently don't have goats but would be willing to have them again with others to help care for them.  The chickens went with my wife. I would like to have chickens again with others help.

My current goal is to invite others who would be interested in starting an intentional community.  I'm open to discussing what this might be and hearing the ideas of other interested folks.  It would be a work in progress and I am trying not to have an agenda starting out.  Temporary housing  would be needed if other wanted to join.  Permanent housing could be built as needed.  

My focus has been and will continue to be on education, growing healthy food to share with the community through our tailgate market and health food stores.  I currently work with the county summer camp program teaching wood working with kids.  It is lots of fun.  This summer I will teach with the Little Middle Folk School at John C. Campbell Folkschool.  This will be my 13th year doing this.  I also participate in heritage festivals, the Foxfire Museum, and craft shows.  I recently led a program on Humanure composting with our Eco Forum monthly at the Unitarian Fellowship in Franklin.  I have conducted tours of our property and gardens for many years.  

I have suspended our very short term volunteer program until others become involved to help with the program.  It has been a real blessing as well as a challenge to work with many young people who have come and stayed with us over the past 12 years.  I am open to year-long internships with the possibility of joining as a permanent member.  I hope to have short term volunteers in the future.  I welcome folks who would like to visit.

We bring together the resources, skills, and interests of city-dwellers seeking a connection to land, and farmers seeking land security without isolation. We all wish to nurture and be nurtured by the land and a vibrant community spirit. We currently have an organic vegetable farm, pastured sheep and rabbits, and a small berry orchard on site, with additional acreage available for other projects. We also welcome prospective members to join in shared projects &amp; establish new projects that complement existing enterprises and steward the land. We are actively seeking new members to be a part of this wonderful group of hardworking, thoughtful and inspired individuals. On-site housing may be available.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22325&quot;&gt;The San Diego Wake Up House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The intent of our community can be summarized by one word &quot;support&quot;. We are here to support one another on our respective spiritual journeys with the practice of mindfulness meditation. We do this within the mission statement of the Wake Up Movement: &quot;Young Buddhists and non-Buddhists for a Healthy and Compassionate Society&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-san-diego-wake-up-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-san-diego-wake-up-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
As we see it, spiritual fulfillment is intrinsically interrelated with social justice and environmental sustainability. So we do our part to speak out against social injustice while we do our best to be sustainable (recycle, compost, grow our own food, shop wisely, eat healthy, etc). We are also all vegetarians on the border of being vegan. However, all of our actions are going to reflect where we are with respect to our spiritual condition, so we do our best to practice: &quot;Peace in oneself, peace in the world&quot; -Thich Nhat Hanh. 

Our aspiration is to &quot;be the change we want to see in the world&quot; -Ghandi.
We also see our home as a resource for the community. We open up our doors to practice meditation together every Friday. 

We love to cook and share meals together. We shop together, clean &amp;amp; do chores together, play board games together, go out to eat together, dance together, etc... We all own bikes, love to hike, camp and get out doors! We have a community garden in the back yard with many fruiting trees (fig, avocado, guava, pear, apple, orange, lemon &amp;amp; lime).

We have couchsurfers and friends sleeping in the common areas constantly. However, we have a balance of privacy and all guest's stays over 1 night must be approved by all house mates for it to occur. 

We are located just west of highway 163, south of Genesee and east of Linda Vista road. Our house is a decent sized 1-story, 5 bedrooms, 3 baths and two huge common areas (one of which is a dedicated space for meditation, yoga and community activities). We generally have 6 housemates including 1 couple. 

Check us out if you ever want to stay here &amp;amp; practice with us! Find us on Facebook!

We are into permaculture, food self reliance, and sustainability. We have chickens, bees, and lots of gardens.  We do eat meat, mostly local or we butcher ourselves. 

There is usually 4-6 people living here, and interns and staff working here who live elsewhere. We have live in internships that go for a three month term. 

We are not set up for overnight visitors. 

We value communication, cooperation, personal space, spirituality without dogma, achievable goals, common visions, work, play, laughter, music, and sharing.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22348&quot;&gt;Fairy Forest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We CHANGED our NAME!  We are no longer &quot;Creative Sanctuary and Freedom Farm&quot; This idea of building a sustainable village in the forest began when I was a 10 years old. Since then I have been many places and done many things, and now I am finally ready to fullfill my childhood and lifelong dream. I never even knew why I had this dream, really, just did. Then six months ago I met someone I could clearly tell was a clairvoyant, and she told me that I am a fairy. She told me as if I should know this already. She was actually shocked when I told her I didn't know! So, I went home and learned as much as I could about REAL fairies. I read online articles, then I read Doreen Virtue's book about incarnated fairies and now everything about me makes sense! NOW I am SO READY to connect with my encarnated elemental brothers and sisters to demonstrate what living in harmony with nature looks like, and help to inspire the world with our other creative passions! This is why we are here. Come, and stay as long as you like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/creative-sanctuary-and-freedom-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/creative-sanctuary-and-freedom-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Step by step, this is to become a retreat from monetary economies and a sacred space to awaken and experience spiritual discovery in environment full of life, love, and inspiration built to inspire a new way of thinking, living, and creating. Its humanity's time to thrive on Earth.  We are currently looking for creative individuals that are truly optimistic and ambitious about making a positive change in humanity as well as spiritual healers and aspiring healers to come and build a strong community of unconditional love for all. We want to share plant knowledge and earthen-house building as a form of meditation. We are attempting to free ourselves from a monetary economy, so others who are on the same path are welcome to come and share ideas on instigating a resource-based economy. We are very peaceful and open-minded people, and we believe that we must be the change that we see in the world. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions! Peace, love and naked squirrels!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22352&quot;&gt;Ed's house&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; __________________ ____________________ ______________________ ______________________ ______________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/eds-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/eds-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
There are 8 of us in a 2 family house on the Cambridge line in
 Somerville. Except for Ed everyone here is a student, a researcher or
 a working professional in their 20's or early 30's. We all get along &amp;
 do things together at times.  The Tuesday night potluck is a nice
 social event of the house. There you can often meet cool scientists
 and artists from Cambridge area.  Other times we may plan a movie
 night, a hiking trip or something else and our friends or extended
 community joins as well. Most often, of course, things just happen
 spontaneously. (There is no mandatory attendance to any function.)
 
We would be an ideal community for those who wish to enjoy living
 together but would not like an overabundance of rules, chores or time
 processing them. At Ed's house, everyone takes responsibilities within
 themselves. We do not have specific chores per se, however, when we
 notice that something needs to be done we assess within ourselves if
 it might be our turn to do it. Same is true with commonly shared
 items. For instance, if you notice that the olive oil is low &amp; you
 haven't bought any in a while you might pick some up the next time you
 go shopping. We each buy our own food but may opt to share any of that
 to the house. Our lives are too busy to fuss about these details any
 more than that. Needless to say, our house is drama free. We realize
 that the harmony amongst us is worth so much more than what any stress
 or tension could ever bring.
 
So write us back if you would like to live with us in our nice old
 house with great people all around you. Hardwood floors to walk on,
 mechanical laundry machines to work for you and a nice old gas stove
 to cook whatever your little heart desires. We are a short 10 to 15
 minute walk to Harvard square and the T, near Inman, 5 min to union,
 15 to porter, 25 to central, on the 86, 83 and a couple others but in
 such a nice quiet neighborhood (just over the Cambridge line in
 Somerville) that you wouldn't know how close you are to everything.
 
We will have rooms that open up now &amp; then &amp; cost between $700 and $1350 per month.
They come with free utils, wifi, internet, laundry etc...

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22353&quot;&gt;MendoDragon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; coop permaculture activism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/mendodragon/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/mendodragon/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are a collective of compassionate people who value living in community.  We aspire to appreciate and enhance our home by working and playing together in harmony.  We strive to understand and support each other through heartfelt communication and sharing wonderful, love-laced meals.  Our vision is to serve as a model of cooperative living that actively resists the dominant paradigm of consumerist culture.

Our name, MendoDragon, comes from the Mondragon Collectives of the Basque Region of Spain where successful enterprises that benefit the whole community are cooperatively developed and collectively owned.  MendoDragon is a cooperative housing model with a communal main house, garage/workshop, old barn, orchards and garden beds on two acres located in Boonville.  Sharing purchase, development and maintenance costs offers an affordable alternative to single person households, as well as providing camaraderie and more hands to do the work.  We envision a total of six personal “bed sheds” clustered around the main house and a future new common space and bath house.

Food is security and at MendoDragon we are serious about food, not only growing it but also preserving it, bartering with it and sharing it.  To this end we are actively working on improving the food production systems we already have in place.  Currently, we have a small flock of hens, an established orchard of apple and pear trees, a new orchard of 25 fruit and nut trees, vegetable and herb gardens and beehives.  We host a monthly community potluck that is sometimes large, sometimes small, but always a lovely dinner party.

MendoDragon is affiliated with Cloud Forest Institute, a 501 (c3) educational non-profit.  CFI was established in 1996 to encourage communities in the temperate forests of Northern California and the cloud forests of Ecuador to re-establish balance within our ecological systems.  CFI serves as fiscal sponsor for other non-profits and produces educational programs ranging from yoga retreats in Ecuador to mycology workshops in Boonville.

Additional infrastructure we plan to develop includes: a cob oven, more veggie and medicinal herb gardens, a ceremonial fire circle, grey water and solar energy systems.  We also envision renovating the old redwood barn into workshop spaces.  While there is a vision, MendoDragon is a canvas waiting for co-creation, a community calling out to conscientious collaborators.

We are a small group of women (and our men or families) who live on a 1/4 acre homestead.  We have 2 residential buildings with the 3rd on the way (build to suit). As our name suggests we tend to be mature females who are living and drawn together to support and be there in our golden years.  We tend to be active, artistic and spiritual while enjoying living, planning, playing and planting or tending to our lives and families.  We are active in the town's greater community which lends itself to our way of living.  We are socially involved and are seen by the locals as great examples of an alternative lifestyle.  We are located in a quaint and established neighborhood in a small rural town about 45 miles east of Austin, TX.  We are called the Queen of the Hill, as the neighborhood is called &quot;The Hill&quot; (Mt. Pleasant) by the locals.  When the 84 households enter The Hill they must pass this house which happens to be located on a corner of the only 2 streets that come and go from this neighborhood.  Also the house is located above the street level and while we are sitting on our porches we view all who come and go from our 'queendom'.  Too funny!

Over the years we have grown into four houses within a few blocks of each other, two of which provide family-style hospitality to people experiencing homelessness, one which offers foster care to children, and a fourth which serves the needs of community and some long-term hospitality. We are also partnering with a medical service provider and a church to soon open a medical respite shelter. We are rooted in the Catholic Worker, with strong influence from community organizing and labor struggles.We engage in anti-racism and housing organizing; grow two city lots of gardens; help facilitate countywide anti-homelessness efforts; and run a no-cost bike shop which sends our 150-200 bicycles every year on a work trade system.</description>

      <name>Foundational Living Colony of New Eden</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22375&quot;&gt;Foundational Living Colony of New Eden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; TO HELP THE PUBLIC GAIN THE CLEAREST UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT MEANS TO COMMUNE WITH FELLOW MAN, WOMAN, AND GOD AS ONE KINGDOM UNDER HEAVEN
The Foundational Living Colony stands for the &quot;Foundational Truths&quot; found in the Word of God, specifically the book of Genesis Chapter One, where it speaks about CREATION, the SIX DAYS OF CREATION and the DAY OF REST to recover. The Theme of CREATION will flow through the Community as each Day of Creation is emphasised; the &quot;Living&quot; we are promised as Children of God, as Yeshuah the Lord said, &quot;I have come to give them life, and life in abundance!&quot; with the attitude that we are &quot;colonists&quot; on this Earth, who have no permanent &quot;Home&quot;, but seek a greater Homeland; the freedom of creativity, enjoyment, education, teaching, encouraging, entertainment, discipline, and especially SERVICE to God and one another through SHARING with one another what we have, and especially our excess with any in need; we stand for all the ancient practical vocations in life that make it self-sufficient and self-generating which will ALWAYS be in demand for the human body;  Because we grow our own food, medicine, collect our own water, and produce our own children, teach our own children, we are thus able to be completely self-sufficient without the need to buy or sell anymore anything from the store with money, or associate with any dangerous influences or trouble or terror anymore. It is self generating and foundational from the ground up, and includes every establishment necessary for fullness of life, and the self-sustaining life for all of us in the pastoral environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/foundational-living-colony-of-new-eden/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/foundational-living-colony-of-new-eden/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Foundational Living Colony stands for Creation, fullness of life, enjoying life to it's fullest extent, the way it was in the beginning, is now, and will be forever. Foundation stands for the foundational things that make life life, where we are &quot;living&quot; creatures, having many gifts, talents and abilities, working together as a &quot;team&quot; for the building of a habitation of Rest for all people, a self-sustaining, self-generating community, and &quot;colony&quot; is a gathering of people who are &quot;pilgrims&quot; on earth, and like an ant colony works together to build their ant hill, the Colony works together as a team, nobody greater or lesser than the other, but for the sake of equality we work, and are servants to each other. The greatest here will be the servant of all. Service and a life of service is what the Colony is all about. 
 The Living Colony is to have eleven establishments encompassing the full nature of life in enjoyment that will be built. It is a University Campus in form with educational opportunities for all, with a classroom environment and &quot;hands-on activities for each hour of the day, an hour each day set aside for each subject: music, gardening, livestock, carpentry, art, Physician Healing Arts, Bird and Fish environments, military training and discipline, teamwork practice, and Theater and Entertainment:
1. The Resting Deer Lodge- The Lodge is the central hub in the community, where all gather for rest, for a cup of tea, mate, or coffee, to relax and listen to calming music, where people can speak, read poetry, lecture, and be heard. It is a place of meditation, rest and healing for all.
2. The Morning Star Music Hall- The music hall is where all gather for hearing the choir, the musical instruments, and where all dance.
3. The Garden and Greenhouse- The Garden will consist of all 12 vegetable families, the Orchard with Apples and the Vineyard of Grapes; while the Greenhouse will grow the Meditteranean Trees like the Olive tree, Pomegranite, Date Palm, Coconut Palm, Fig tree and more; a medicinal garden of herbs also with Rosemary, Sage, Thyme, Lavender, Valerian, and more
4. The Physician's Healing Center and Apothecary- This center is to have access to all the trees, herbs, and medicines, Gemstones, with Frankinsence and Myrrh, to have all necessary medicines to heal all diseases, give massages, footbaths to release toxins, and more. Vegetarian nutrition is encouraged, the most universal health care for all people.
5. The Architectural Construction Center_ The Construction Center is to have the necessary saw-mills, tools, and instruments for the construction of the Livestock Stables, chicken coops, dog houses, posts, beams, rafters, chairs, furniture, and other items. Universal construction method is the Joint and Tennon method, the most secure and stable method.
6. The Military Training Facility- The Training Facility will train people for military discipline, respect, fitness, teamwork, and good morale among all. There will be excercises, salutes, marching, and battle strategy and battle re-enactments, team sports like basketball, capture-the-flag, and flag football. 
7. The Astrological Space Center- The Space Center will teach people the stars, constellations, signs, seasons, calendars, and the beauty of the Heavens. The twelve constellations of the zodiac will be taught and studied, and the other 88 constellations of the universe.
8. Livestock area and sheepfold- The livestock area will include all necessary livestock: sheep, goats, cattle, and all pets, horse stable with horses. There will be no slaughter of animals, but only the milk, wool, and horse-power will be used. No death of animals will take place but they will be used for what they are. 
9. Fish Marina and Bird Sanctuary- The fish will be stocked in a central pond and a swale or trough dug around the campus, where fish will be. There is to be a continual flow of water sourced by fountain pumps and water wheels to collect water. The central water source is to have a fountain and enclosed by the Resting Deer Lodge in the center. Birds shall have relative confinement but the freedom to fly as the please. Tame birds like parakeets and parrots are encouraged, yardbirds like cardinals and finches also encouraged and fed daily. 
10. Entertainment, play and skit Amphitheater- The entertainment center will be for the entertainment of the people; where plays are enacted, skits, martial arts demonstrations, stories read and characters given lines and parts then enacted in plays. It will bring refreshment to all and lighten the mood for everyone involved. 
11. Resurrection Burial Chambers- Preparation for our dead is necessary and vital. Proper care of any who die is a standard. Bodies are &quot;embalmed&quot; (preserved) with the preservational medicines of Aloe Vera and Myrrh Gum by dipping strips of cloth into an Aloe/Myrrh mixture and wrapping the bodies with that. This is done once every week. We are to care for the body even after death. Burial Chambers are to be built similar to a root cellar, yet with more eloquence. Chambers can be built with concrete slab foundation, cinder block walls, cedar or pine or acacia wood for the roof, and six feet of earth piled on top by a buldozer or a team of shovelers. The Chambers are to have a double-door entrance where those who embalm the dead can go freely in and out at will. This is the standard for all who die and proper care of the body after death. 
These are the eleven establishments for the Foundational Living Colony. All are welcome, young, middle aged, and elderly, all gifts, talents and abilities also encouraged. No one should be left out, but all welcome to engage in this great learning, building, and fellowship practice here. This is for the good of all people, all races, all ages, all men and women both; there is no partiality here. Come one and all and enjoy this process with me. Let us enjoy life again to it's fullest extent and be not hindered by anything. You are free to serve, you are not slaves. Welcome, and come soon!</description>

Established in 2010 on Ann Arbor's Old West Side, our home has been dubbed the Feedbag since we're constantly feeding people. 

We're a household of grad students and working professionals, brought to Michigan for work or school, who wanted to live in a place that was more than just roommates passing in the night.  We share meals, all food and household expenses, and we have herb and vegetable gardens.  We've been known to brew our own beer and cure our own bacon and bake bread and sweet things from scratch.

Our house welcomes a steady stream of local friends and out of town guests, though on an average night, we're more apt to be sitting around chatting quietly over drinks or reading side by side on the couch than out making ruckuses.  We're fond of fruit-picking and vegetable growing and bonfires and leisurely dinners and even the occasional house-cleaning extravaganza.  Some of us play instruments. Some of us knit, crochet or sew. 

We laugh a lot. Sometimes we cry.  Mostly, we just enjoy doing life together.

VEGAN / VEGETARIAN COHOUSING COMMUNITY

GROUP STATUS : Forming

OPEN TO NEW PEOPLE : Sussex residents only please 


We are in the process of forming a small vegan/vegetarian cohousing community in Brighton in Sussex in the UK and are now inviting more people to join us to make it happen. 



We're looking for people who live in Brighton and are already fully committed vegans or vegetarians, passionate about animal rights and who share our core eco values and left wing world view. 


We need people with different kinds of skills such as gardening, permaculture, building, legal, people skills, herbal medicine, computer etc and who can give time and energy to all aspects of this project and form a close and sharing community.  


Ecological concerns are very important to this community and these would be the driving force behind the installation of high quality solar thermal or photovoltaic panels and or a domestic wind turbine with a feed in tariff, incorporating rainwater harvesting, underfloor heating, a wood burning stove and a communal fruit and veg growing area using permaculture. 


Where renovation and development are necessary, recycled and or locally sourced building materials will be used together with maximum energy efficiency measures. 


There will be composting and there could be a compost toilet. 
 

Rescued chickens and domestic animals as pets will be welcome. 

If you are interested in joining veganiccohousing you must be vegan or completely vegetarian which means no meat or fish at all and you must live in Brighton . . . 

For more info, including a schedule, property and buying options please visit our new website : veganiccohousing.com

      <name>Bitternut Homestead Urban Collective</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22390&quot;&gt;Bitternut Homestead Urban Collective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Ecological Social Justice, Permaculture Kitchen Gardening, Community Development Projects, Progressive Political Organizing and Activism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bitternut-collective-on-otisco-st/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bitternut-collective-on-otisco-st/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
The Bitternut Homestead (named after the Native American Iroquois word Otisco, or Us-te-ke, meaning &quot;bitter-nut-hickory&quot;) is a 4 bedroom home in Syracuse's Near West Side (NWS) just off of downtown.  Syracuse is a city of 145,000 people, and the NWS is an urban community with high racial, but low economic, diversity - a median income of $25,653 exists in the bottom 3.5% of national zip codes.

The house at 717 Otisco St is a 100-year old renovated Victorian purchased in 2010 for $1 from Home Headquarters (HHQ), a local quasi-governmental/non-profit housing agency.  The house had been vacant for 3-4 years at the time of purchase, and required new plumbing, electric, heating, hot water, structural repairs from water and animal damage, and major interior and exterior finish work.  For instance, all window glass was broken and would be replaced while preserving the original wooden frames and sills.

Residents of the Homestead live and &quot;act&quot; together, a primary strategy for creating community.  Desired shared chores include cooking, shopping, cleaning, trash/recycling, gardening, and other tasks including a spring and fall cleaning day, and a spring and fall gardening day.  The grounds are landscaped according to Permaculture principles &amp;amp; design, the original owner Frank Cetera being a local Permaculture educator and designer.  The Collective also houses the operations desk/office of The Alchemical Nursery, a non-profit organization working to create &quot;Regenerative Landscapes and Lifestyles&quot; utilizing strategies from the realms of Permaculture, mutual aid, eco-socialism, social justice, &amp;amp; ecovillage philosophies &amp;amp; methodologies; and this year hosted a campaign HQ office for a resident's Green Party run for city council.

Natural building &amp;amp; simple living are also strategies being utilized.  Heating is currently through electric baseboard heating for instance.  Although electric heating is initially more expensive from the supply side, it was chosen because it is less expensive to install, allows zoned control in each room, can be supplied by solar panels in the future, can be secondary/supplementary only when wood burning appliance is installed, and to keep natural gas out of this &quot;Anti-Fracking House&quot;.  Other techniques include interior natural clay plastering and homemade paints, hugelkultur garden beds made from downed woody debris, hand finished floors (scraping, sanding, treating with linseed oil), food fermentation and preservation.

We have a main house and are working towards sleepouts and other housing options. Currently 4 adults and one teenager permanent residents. We run 3 fundraising opshops/charity stores that help pay for the mortgage and animal care. Residents pay their own (communal) food costs. Currently over 160 animals residing at the sanctuary - pigs, goats, cows, sheep, cats, dogs, geese, chooks, ducks, a horse and more!

Our house has twelve bedrooms, two kitchens, a cat, some fish, and a two-story rope swing.
 We live together, not as individuals merely cohabitating, but as an extended family, supporting and loving one other.
 The community extends beyond our house into the neighborhood at-large. There are many people who spend many hours here, but live at other addresses close by.
 Our community includes artists, environmentalists, musicians, educators, social workers, advocates, and students.
 We often take group trips to concerts, art shows, hiking, and other such outings. We cook and brew beer, garden and dance, play music and make art, travel and read together.
 We have potlucks every Sunday evening, and we welcome visitors to this weekly feast!</description>

Have you ever felt drawn to something different than the status quo? Does the American dream not quite ring true for you? Do you dream of a community of peaceful Christ followers that live simply, do good, and love others without all the dogma and legalism? Are you passionate about Jesus and want desperately to find a group of believers who want to return to the love and passion of the early church but don't feel comfortable with the denominations you've been a part of? Maybe it's time for something new. I personally have an undying passion for Christ and his church, but I find that every time I'm &quot;church&quot; I feel like I’m watching a production, and once I'm away from the noise and the lights and music, I feel emptier than ever... my vision is an intentional community of believers that strives to reflect the early church. I’m not quite sure what it will look like, but here are a few ideas.
•	Co-housing and daily communal prayer and worship. Shared chores and at least one meal daily. 
•	Ministering to the community in areas of homelessness, social work, maybe eventually a food pantry. 
•	various outreaches
•	sustainability and ecological stewardship
•	A diverse, multicultural, group of Jesus lovers from all walks of life! 

There have been a few to attempt what I’m dreaming up, but before you write it off as another cult, look up Jesus people and the simple way, some others have the same idea and are doing it right! Together we can make this happen!
If you like what you’ve read and want to start a dialogue email me at machaseh@yahoo.com (it’s Hebrew for refuge ^_^)

We live intentionally to care for each other and the environment and over the years to acquire housing in close proximity to one another with common spaces for community activities. We are committed to learn how to be a community that identifies itself as a &quot;natural support&quot; for a sustainable number of marginalized individuals who live in the community (and more outside the physical community) by engaging them in programs of social agriculture (or care farming), creative self-expression through the arts, micro-enterprises in the arts, urban farming and marketing, and the hospitality aspects of operating a retreat center that provides residencies to artists and activists who come to develop their work in collaboration with a person who has a psychiatric label or is disenfranchised from society though such label. The artists' only obligation for this no cost residency is to include a mentally disturbed resident in need of community recognition and engagement in some phases of the development of their art or performance. We hope to support one another as residents seeking permanent community in comfortable safe housing areas that include some of society's most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/a-growing-playce-for-practice-in-human-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/a-growing-playce-for-practice-in-human-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Presently we have many features of an established intentional community and are working toward sustainability around growing food, raising chickens and bees, and supporting both residents and non-residents with emotional challenges to express themselves and heal through the arts. We also have a therapeutic miniature horse, and engage people in social agriculture or &quot;care farming,&quot; in which a mini-farm is used to create and maintain community with disenfranchised individuals. We hold meetings and a &quot;creative movement group&quot; in New Orleans with occasional extended retreat weekends in Bay Saint Louis designed to help us develop consensus skills, practice collaboration, identify our common values, objectives and covenants, and to establish our bylaws. We are presently four Bay Saint Louis residents and four non-residential members in New Orleans. Some of us wish to own our own homes, while others wish to remain renters; there is a plethora of housing stock either contiguous to the Bay Saint Louis properties, located in &quot;Old Town,&quot; or within short walking distance of it. We would like to acquire adjacent properties in the neighborhood. Two residents live in a self-contained house with a studio apartment in the rear for another resident, who is also the farm manager. The house next door is reserved for &quot;retreats&quot; in which artists come either in groups or individually to do their own creative work and to share it with a person with mental challenges to engage that person's in self expression.  In the future, we hope for shared office space, personnel and a performance venue where micro businesses, social entrepreneurships, or cooperative businesses will emerge.

People who live in the community must be open to inclusion of people from all races and backgrounds, and over time, they must be willing to include and offer natural support to a few individuals who have special life challenges or have been marginalized. Presently a cooperative is forming within this community among people who are using the arts and a Buddhist model for &quot;being present&quot; with people who are experiencing what is called &quot;psychosis&quot; in the medical system. The aim of the cooperative is to offer an a more compassionate form of healing or a place of sanctuary from the brutality associated with undergoing conventional &quot;treatment.&quot;  At this time, this group is called &quot;The BeWith Community,&quot; and it is also the model used by artists in residence working with those who have psychological maladies. 

Objectives: We need people who can buy or rent residences so we can create a nearly contiguous pattern of properties that will make community life viable in a small urban setting. But anyone is welcome to apply who wishes to participate in building a community where a variety of micro-businesses or social entrepreneurships will emerge in urban farming, renovation and building with salvaged materials, social agriculture, holistic mental health, and the operation of a well-needed retreat center for urban artists (New Orleans artists will have first consideration), designed to host workshops in performing arts, healing retreats, InterPlay events (www.interPlay.org), and other convergences in the arts for social change. 

Social agriculture” (care famring) is one such entrepreneurship that will quickly grow to a business in the larger community, but a pre-vocational training program in the gardens is already in use on the community grounds to engage adults and children from the outside community in caring for plants and animals while they acquire a sense of belonging, purpose, and interdependence of all life on earth. Right now there are only four of us in the social garden space, which is used also for gatherings--for “play” or social purposes that build community. Social agriculture is inclusive, creative, and playful. It offers alternative activities for healing mind and body. We grow food. We grow community. We grow well. 

Come home to A Playce that creates its sustainability through interdependence, artistic expression, and commitment to belonging and purpose for everybody.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22414&quot;&gt;Pilot House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Sustainable Living Practices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/pilot-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/pilot-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Pilot House presents opportunities to explore and develop an intentional, residential co-op styled, eco-community model. This project involves completing a remodeling design for an 1890s era three story house with four rooms suitable as individual personal spaces, one and three quarter baths, along with common areas including a kitchen, a family room, a living room, a small utility room, and full basement.

Project funding is provided by participants in the community, whether subscribing contributors to the model, shorter term guests, monthly renters, or simply floor campers just passing through. Applying stewardship to this old house rewards participants with direct returns on investments. 

Anyone interested in visiting is welcome anytime. Shorter term living arrangements will be made on an individual basis. Settling in for a month or so to check out this prospect will involve helping out with the cash flow plus doing some basic work assignments of about 40 hours per month.

A basic premise for Pilot House is that Intentional Community is a personal adventure that explores real frontiers of human social experience and that Community must therefore be intentionally accomplished. An open conversation policy provides our basis for organizing community processes, addressing individual interests, evaluating progress, and meeting any challenges in our cooperative living arrangements.

There are no philosophical or devotional practices required of residents of the community, only honest respect for any adopted by others, and agreement that personal practices will not impose on other member's lifestyles or liberties.

As the community aspect of this project develops, mutual benefits of shared equity practices and property held in common in the co-op model will be gained. Continuing household members will determine their equitable co-ownership positions in it through their contributions to the project.

Please accept this invitation, if you like, to help explore a work in progress, and further chart its course.

People are like fingers of a hand, who work together to accomplish great things. Earth Tribe’s purpose is to remind people how to thrive with each other.

Healthy Individual, Healthy Community, Healthy Planet!
 

We can live cooperatively with Earth and each other.

We can live peacefully, happily, full of vitality, wonder, freedom, and fun.

Let us create and share a way of life which is enriching, exciting, and sustainable!

We’re Building a Community of Our Dreams…

A group of good friends are looking for farming and community land in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, etc. Generally somewhere remote in the mid-atlantic area, with mountains, great water sources, plenty of forest, and luscious soil that receives solid sunshine!

Organic food cultivation will be integral. Energy will also be harvested from nature in non invasive ways. Sustainability and self-sufficiency will be cornerstone values to the pursuit.

There will be a school integrated into the community so that there is continuing education available for all ages in an unlimited variety of fields based on the input and interests of the members of the community, who teach most of the classes, along with visiting teachers.

The school also helps by hosting retreats, as well as classes offered for work/trade or paying visitors, and guests from other communities. A form of barter through knowledge and teaching, which continues to enrich, nourish, strengthen and renew the tribe.

It starts with a core group and the right opportunity. There are at least a hand or two of us who all know each other very well and who want to do this together, plus many others who could be called upon in order to embolden and expand on projects when they are ready. We are willing to live on your farm or land through an agreement to help you turn it into a community, if we share a similar vision.

Connect to Earth Tribe!

If you would like to connect to our project, to offer any ideas, assistance, or advice, please message below or email Connect@Earth-Tribe.org. You can also hear from us and reach us on Facebook! Thank you!

NOTE: We do not yet have land, please do not email about a place to stay or to rent, because there is not one yet. This is a dream that we are working towards putting in place by around 2020.

      <name>Heart-Culture Farm Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22425&quot;&gt;Heart-Culture Farm Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Cooperative Childraising, Sustainable Food Production&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/heart-culture-farm-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/heart-culture-farm-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
Located on an historical 1890's homestead on the West edge of the city of Eugene, Oregon, Heart-Culture Farm Community is committed to experiments in sustainability. Our setting, on the edge of the Fern Ridge Wetlands Wildlife Preserve, lends unique opportunities and challenges, as we work to listen to the land, encourage rare wetlands species to thrive, and learn to steward our livestock in a way that increases the health of our local ecosystems.  

Much of our food is grown on-site, including fruits, vegetables, milk, eggs, and meats.  Some long-term residents are experienced in traditional farm skills, including butchering and wildcrafting.  We pasture our livestock and feed them organic and non-GMO as much as possible.  Weston Price and traditional diet life-ways are an inspiration.  

Heart-Culture is a family-oriented community, with primarily home-schooled children.  The Continuum Concept, Attachment Parenting, Hand in Hand Parenting, and Waldorf have all influenced our community parenting style.  Most babies and toddlers are raised diaper free (Elimination Communication), with extended breastfeeding and cooperative parenting as the norm.

We recognize the importance of both ecological and interpersonal sustainability.  We are committed to personal and interpersonal growth.  Each individual is responsible for their own growth path, with some group activities.  Participation in mediation processes is mandatory.  Our members' growth paths range from Re-Evaluation Co-Counseling, to Shamanism, to Polyamory.  Everyone has personal challenges, and that's fine as long as we keep it moving.  Emotional growth is key to sustainable communities, and living in community is, in itself, a part of our growth path.

All forms of loving relationships are welcome at Heart-Culture.  Monogamy, Polyamory, hetero- and homo-sexuality, and celibacy are all potentially loving lifestyle/relationship options.  We recognize the value of fluid relationship forms, and strive to make choices from our true selves instead of being confined to society's boxes.  Some of our members are married and monogamous (both hetero- and homosexual); some are single parents, others have polyamorous relationships.  Whatever we choose, we remain aware of the family-oriented nature of our community.</description>

      <name>CampOma Rural &amp; Pumpkin Spice Urban EcoVillage</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22427&quot;&gt;CampOma Rural &amp; Pumpkin Spice Urban EcoVillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; enviro-spiritual, healing camp.
My vision for the land:

A place where families and individuals contribute to a community of acceptance, love, joy, and a place for meaningful work. A place where individual's visions can become reality – so long as it melds with the the existing group and their parameters of being environmentally sound.  A healing, smoke and drug free environment.  Self sustaining, off the grid, able to grow most of our own food using a permaculture model. A strong commitment from members to deal with one's emotional stuff and a willingness to learn how to communicate compassionately and be respectful to everyone.  
This is a healing center for the community, our guests, and the land. We aim to have a retreat in the woods with tree houses, cob, cord wood, strawbale and all sorts of fun eco-structures (ie. boat beds in the air, hammock camping, hobbit holes etc! - your imagination is the limit). A campground for individuals of all ages and families to learn about the natural environment and gain skills they can use elsewhere. An outdoor school program. Eco-businesses such as furniture making from the 100 acres of maple trees, natural building workshops, Llama packing, wilderness survival, mushroom growing for entrepreneurial souls are but a few ideas to generate our own economic security. Everyone will contribute what they can in time, talent, and treasure (perhaps 50% income sharing?). Work as little as possible for the money economy on the outside world and incorporate a fair trade system, including exchange for our services like food, helping build each other's housing, retreats, and workshops. Generate enough capital from business off the land to sustain ourselves and be debt and mortgage free. Yeah! We will serve as good stewards of the land to rejuvenate the previously clear cut forest and rehabilitate the creek. We intend to have a permaculture garden and food forest, and recruit interns to teach gardening and natural building to. 
 We want to extend ourselves beyond our boundaries to share our skills and tools with neighbors and visitors.  We aim to establish eco-village zoning to be able to grow beyond 20 members to approximately 120 -130 members eventually. We will serve as a world-wide model of a new operating system which meets our social, economic and basic human needs without oppressing others, with cooperation rather than competition, which is life affirming as the fullest expression of what it is to be a self actualized human able to joyously care for each other, our neighbors and our environment!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/campoma/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/campoma/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We have a city &amp;amp; rural community within the Portland area. Eagle Creek, just 25 miles outside of beautiful Portland, Oregon, is situated in the foothills of Mt. Hood on 120 acres, and is the home of a rustic, newly forming enviro-spiritual, healing, permaculture community and are hoping to start an Outdoor School program. In Portland we have a 4 bedroom house on 1/4 of an acre with 2 chickens currently and we are installing a geothermal greenhouse. Ideally, we are looking for 10 -15 pioneering individuals or couples to put energy into creating this community.  We hope to be able to serve those who need a city connection at times and those who want to be more off-grid. The land is paid for already, so that is not a hurdle; however, everything else: road in, the buildings, water, energy sources, monetary resources etc. still needs to be created. I plan to build a home and put in some infrastructure in 2019. If you like to start with a completely open slate and create from scratch, then this community is for you! Open to all sorts of ideas provided they fit within the realm of being environmentally sound and are suitable to forestland. Consider furniture making, building treehouses and natural buildings, setting up a camp for kids and adults to learn about nature and survival skills, hosting healing retreats, doing llama packing, spinning your own wool etc.  Really the possibilities are as large as your imagination. You must be emotionally mature and ready to learn, expand and stretch beyond your comfort zone to make a healthy community and create a true space of love.
We plan to start small with 10 - 15 members and who knows if eco-village zoning becomes a legal zone to grow from there. THIS IS A DRUG AND SMOKE FREE COMMUNITY (including marijuana and limited to preferably no alcohol). That's the main liberation! Please submit your ideas and the gifts you bring for consideration as a founding member of this community to FionaRhea.  If you're local to Portland, come join us up on the land most of the summer as we work on various projects. I recommend reading Creating a Life Together and the Ringing Cedar series for insights into building community. Come see what we're up to and see if you'd like to put some roots down and start a project of your own!

We're looking to unite with others who may be looking to form a striving to live in Torah based community.  The vision that we have is one in which we unite (become echad) to buy a piece of land somewhere. (we have bought land and houses in N MS ?)  or (where ever the RUACH (Set apart holy spirit leads us - right now in N MS) Where we may  develop our hearts, minds and bodies to serve the MOST HIGH YHVH and His son YAHHUASHUA led by the RUACH HA CHODESH  and to be able to produce as much of our basic needs (food, water, shelter, energy, heat, etc.). This community would be for folks who are seeking the truth of the creator YHVH and his son our redeemer Yahshua Ha Maschiach through the revelation given to us in his word the Torah, (laws or commandments) the prophets and the writings {Holy Bible).  We're looking for folks that are able to get along with people who are searching for the truth of the sacred Scriptures and if they have differing views on issues concerning the chodesh set apart holy names, the moedim holy chodesh set apart dates and how they are observed, the wearing of beards, tzitzits, kippahs,(whether you wear them or not)  women's roles and clothing, whether you feel that you must use their Sacred names and how or not to use them at all, if you still use the name of Jesus ? Yahshua or not (by what name did you first come to His knowledge?).  I'm looking for people that are understanding enough to know that you must learn to love your neighbor as yourself and let people worship the Son and the Father as they feel led to.  This is not to say that that we should wink at sin and allow open sin in the camp.  This is meant to give people the freedom and room to allow for variations in the way people honor Our Creator in the manner in which we feel led to.  I'm looking to join up with people can agree to love their neighbors even if they do something that they may not completely agree with.  Bottom line is if you see what's coming down the road and you still want to argue and disagree about all things mentioned above and any other points that I'm sure I missed, please don't reply to this posting, but if you can see the writing on the wall for this nation and would like to become as echad (united) as you can with others (on the points you can be united on and leaving the ones you're not aside for study), then please by all means contact me as soon as possible!</description>

These four pillars are the common ground on which we base our decisions, which we make by consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/central-pa-community-housing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/central-pa-community-housing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Central PA Community Housing (the co-op/ Houseasaurus) is a housing cooperative located in State College, Pennsylvania that formed in 2005.

Currently, CPCH occupies one rented property near Pennsylvania State University. We strive to live by values of queer positivity, environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and egalitarianism. We are a diverse group of undergrads, grad students, and community members with different passions that have brought us together. 

We host house dinners Sunday - Thursday at 7 pm which are open to the community, as well as boarders (individuals who pay to eat dinners with us but do not live in the house).

We also host Community Cafe every Friday night at 6 pm, which is a discussion group or workshop hosted by a different house member every week. Past Conspiracy Cafes have included topics such as gender equality, consumerism, encryption and free software, and spoken word.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22454&quot;&gt;Bay View Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Bay View Ecovillage was established to provide a model of micro-community life in an
urban environment.  Living arrangements are designed to align people, planet and
pocketbook by creating opportunities for individuals to build sustainable social, environmental and financial systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bay-view-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bay-view-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Bay View Ecovillage is a diverse, urban intentional community focused on social connections and environmental action. Located in the Bay View neighborhood of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, only blocks from Lake Michigan, we believe quality of life increases as our &quot;footprint&quot; decreases. Representing multiple different decades of experience, we have 14 members/residents living in two duplexes.

      <name>Bosque Village: San Galileo</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22455&quot;&gt;Bosque Village: San Galileo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Bosque Village is an experiment in developing a human culture which can live without destroying the earth. It is a permaculture farm and a growing intentional community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bosque-village-san-galileo/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bosque-village-san-galileo/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Bosque Village is located in a safe area in the highlands of Michoacan, Mexico near Patzcuaro. We are collecting independent and responsible people who lead a healthy active lifestyle to add to our little group.

We have solar panels, rain capture, composting toilets, solar ovens, solar food dehydration, food forest gardens, chickens, rabbits, an art studio, wood fired sauna etc. 
We build with cob, and would like to make examples of most types of eco-construction. 

The current options for living with us include:

* Coming as a participant. Optimal candidates have skills we need, have a self-motivated working attitude, and are driven to help the Bosque system succeed. We are focused on producing videos to share our cultural experiments. All participants must apply. 

* Developing your compatible business here. 
 You could use the Bosque space to do your yoga or meditation workshops. English teachers and Spanish teachers could offer their services. Leading retreats and providing guest services. Your could teach permaculture or ecobuilding courses. What vision do you have to create?

* An Alternative: Become a neighbor. There are properties and houses near the Bosque which are available for rent or purchase. This area is full of interesting people and is becoming a large community of environmentally-minded folks! Foreigners can legally own land in Mexico. (Except on the coast, but we are in the highlands.)

The best way to get involved is to visit the Bosque as a participant to see how you like the area, the forest, and the people.

Updates:

The duplex at 429 and 431 N. Hamilton Avenue, 46201 is for sale. It is the next building to the north. Here is a link to details: https://www.realestate.com/429-n-hamilton-ave-indianapolis-in-46201--1088844 . Also, there is a newly refurbished house a short walk away on the 400 block of Jefferson Avenue. Here's a link for a three bedroom rental/rent to own:  https://indianapolis.craigslist.org/reo/d/rent-rent-to-own-3-bedrooms-2/6695822333.html . 

A not for profit is in the process of acquiring abandoned housing in our neighborhood to restore and sell to home owners. Several of us are assembling a group to integrate appropriate technologies into these sites. Examples are photovoltaic, passive geothermal and greenhouses. We have yet to make definite designs. 

Available are bedrooms with shared common spaces ($320 - 450 monthly). The landlord is in touch with nearby landlords who might have vacancies in entire apartments and houses that are for rent and or for sale. 

By the way, nearby Phoenix Urban Farm is making tremendous strides with its gardening, hoop house and Fifth Friday Art Shows https://www.facebook.com/events/1602650446529737/ .  

Current projects:
early planning to fix up and occupy nearby abandoned duplexes, 
building repair and maintenance (especially gutter work and minor roofing),
food forest development,
getting rental bedrooms and housing occupied,
gardening,
and 
mutual support (e.g., facilitating one each others goals, barter, finding nearby housing for quality neighbors).

Additional concerns:
starting a local internet service,
finding buyers for nearby housing,
and 
bringing in and starting businesses. 

Permaculturalists, edible landscapers and foraging experts are very welcome. Also, fundraising activity is invited to enhance the economic, agricultural and ecological activity. I would delight in having green and community minded people live in the nearby rentals and housing that is for sale. Bedrooms with shared common spaces are for rent in the duplex. WWOOFers (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) are encouraged to consider collaborating here; shelter and food can be worked out. 
  
---------------------------- 

Greg is willing to help place quality people in bedrooms, apartment and houses. Development of the community's direction is ongoing. 
===

Of ongoing concern to Greg is how to make the neighborhood better without the negatives that can come with neighborhood  improvement. We need to raise up everyone. Any social workers or social work minded people interested? Ecological matters, including education and advocacy, are vital concerns.
===

The physical boundaries of the community are intended to be broader than building's site. Nearby is the Green Shepherd project, Fruit Loop Acres farm and Basic Roots Community Foods distribution, and a community garden.
===


At minimum we would be a group focused on the well being of our members.
===


Greg's foci are to be landlord, farmer, facilitator of community and advocate for ecological matters. Members, and supporters, are invited to collaborate with him. Some complimentary services that he suggests are: 
a bike shop, 
online sale of bike parts, 
grant researcher and writer,
fundraiser,
bookkeeper, 
hauling, 
building improvement, 
landscaping, 
soil improvement, 
internet service, 
foraging,
an arts center, 
permaculture courses and consultation, an agricultural apprenticeship program, and a nature conservation and restoration corps.
===


Minimum requirements for residential membership:
1. Concern for the impact of our ecological footprint.
2. Willingness to engage in enhancing our quality of life. 
3. Payment of monthly bills for housing, utilities, and enhancements. Typical price is $300 - $450 monthly per bedroom. Barter can be included. 

The four bedroom apartment rents for around $700 per month; utilities are not included.

The Goddess's Temple Wiccan Village is a center for training in Wicca. It is a school where many seasoned priestesses and priests are available to impart their knowledge and life experiences with people interested in threading a Wiccan sacerdotal pathway or in knowing that pathway better.

We are a center for communal living, studying and celebrating the Goddess. We have places dedicated to worshiping, to learning, and to living a pagan lifestyle.

Though this is a Wiccan community, we may accept members of all creeds, as long as they abide to Brazilian legislation against religious prejudice, and agree to participate in all community's activities that are not religion oriented.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22473&quot;&gt;Oran Mor Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We live harmoniously with the land, loving and respecting all its inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/oran-mor/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/oran-mor/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Currently Seeking: Interns and Apprentices with knowledge of Natural Building and Permaculture or a willingness to learn!

We are a small egalitarian community and organic farm established in June of 2003 and situated on 113 acres in the hills of Ozark County, MO. The terrain is rocky with several creeks and we enjoy four distinctly, beautiful seasons.

We raise dairy goats, rabbits, egg chickens &amp;amp; ducks, geese, guineas, dogs n cats, and lots of vegetables using local organic inputs and no-till design. We grow extensive herb gardens and fruit trees. We work to put the principles of Permaculture into daily practice, using clean energy resources and recycling our waste as best we can. We are striving to minimize our reliance on fossil fuels and electricity as much as possible.

Our commitment to living simply translates to many lifestyle choices here. Our main communal building runs on solar power and has few ammenities. We have a trailer connected to the grid that powers the rest of the farm. We do all of our cooking on woodfires year round, which means cooking in our outdoor kitchen in the warmer months. Our laundry is done by hand and dried on clothes lines. Our dishes are done by hand using rain water heated on our woodfire. Our shower water is also heated on the woodstove. These are some central differences to what most folks are used to. It is a commitment of time and effort, and we feel it is rewarding and pays off. We love life and we have fun with our commitments.

We offer a wide range of skilled and unskilled work experiences in gardening, cooking, canning, fermentation, sustainable construction, milking, cheesemaking, forestry, salvage, maintenance, and more. We have an ongoing need for alternative, ecologically aware construction, organic permaculture style gardening, home and land improvement, and hard workers with thoughtful conversations.

Length of stay is entirely negotiable. We are accepting new members. Meals are communal. WWOOFers will be expected to attend daily priority meetings and to take an active part in chores and projects. Opportunities are available year 'round. Very limited transportation is available. Children and pets are welcome with prior approval.

Alcohol is enjoyed occasionally. Some of us smoke.

Established in 1972, we are an urban housing cooperative that seeks to foster community and sustainable lifestyles. We are adults and children with ages ranging from seven to sixty-seven. We live in a large fifteen-bedroom house built in the early 1900s.

We share organic, vegetarian food, although few of our current members are vegetarian. We have at least one scheduled communal meal a month. Currently we practice a moderate form of income sharing in which members pay a portion of their income to the community in addition to payments for base dues and food.

We seek to live a more environmentally sustainable and communitarian lifestyle. Title to our property is held by the Evergreen Land Trust.

We have been creating an intentional community since 1982.
The Apex is a limited-equity housing cooperative located at First Avenue and Bell Street in Seattle's Belltown district. Apex provides its members with affordable housing and community facilities on a nonprofit basis. Apex seeks diversity of all types in its members and caters especially to people eligible for low-income housing.
We own it!
Apex members (there are about twenty-five of us) collectively own and operate 38% of the building (the upper two floors; the owner of ground level retail owns the remaining portion). This ownership translates to a lot of freedom, responsibility, and community involvement on the part of members.

Affordable housing
Diversity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/santa-rosa-creek-commons/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/santa-rosa-creek-commons/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;SRCC (Santa Rosa Creek Commons) is an established Limited Equity Housing Cooperative (LEHC) where everyone is a shareholder and  manager. We are located near downtown Santa Rosa, California. Our property includes 27 units in three 2-story apartment buildings and two older houses that have been divided into duplexes. As a cooperative, each household owns one share in the nonprofit corporation that owns the property. Members are considered owners, but rather than owning the unit occupied, members collectively own the whole property. Members purchase a share just prior to moving in and pay a regular monthly Carrying Charge that covers the mortgage, insurance, maintenance, water/sewer, garbage/recycling and overhead. All members form the Board of Directors. Decisions are made using a consensus process in which proposals are generated by committees and decided upon by the Board at a monthly meeting. Each member contributes at least 8 hours a month in labor, in addition to the Board meeting and two committee meetings. SRCC is self-managed, and we do as much of our own maintenance as we can. Social events include monthly potlucks, holiday parties, an annual 4th of July+SRCC Anniversary party, and other celebrations. Most of our community sits well off the street, nestled into a forest glen next to a year-round creek that runs through town. We are honored to have been referred to as a little piece of Walden in downtown Santa Rosa. Shops and restaurants in downtown Santa Rosa are just a short walk away, as are nearby services such as the main post office and library, government offices (including City Hall, state and federal buildings), and Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital.</description>

If after you read through this material and you feel like you are the 1 in 1,000,000 who we need on our team right now at this stage, please write us telling us why you think you might be that person......

Our community is forming, although some of our information is written in present tense. Please keep in mind- there is no land and no infrastructure yet!  

This is the original visioning document. It is simply a summary of what we hope and dream our community to look like in the nearest possible future. It's our goal. The actual details and systems are laid out in other documents.

Return of the Tribes-

Sometimes when I close my eyes, I'm taken to another place, another time. I'm writing this down once more as a map of my journey. This is a place of Peace and Joy, a time of Love and Happiness. Here there is an abundance of Life, fields of green and amber flourishing with grain, fruit and vegetables. Healthy, vibrant forests wrap around a beautiful, clean river valley. The scents of wildflowers and fragrant herbs bathe the senses. The sounds of children’s’ laughter and people singing and drumming as they tend the fields carry on the wind. As you come closer, as if drawn in by magnetic attraction, you see cabins, cottages, greenhouses and earthshelters dotting the countryside, encircling the fields and pastures. People smile warmly, welcoming you home. This is Tribe, this is Community, this is The Garden- our true home, where we belong.

As you wander down a small road, winding its way past family dwellings and farm buildings, there stand wind turbines, a wood gasifier and solar panels harnessing natural energy in a natural way. Everywhere can be seen people happily going about the day. You see the Building Crew, creating a new home for one of the families off to the East. Over there you notice a group of children leading their teacher on a class excursion tracing the edge of the forest, tracking animals and exploring plants. Ahead you see the Permaculture Crew planting seeds for the future and a group tending to the various farm animals. There are children everywhere as the road winds closer to the community's center. The children here attend a school taught by various community people for a few hours a day. Another lesson is spent visiting the different crews in their daily rounds, whether it be the Food prep.Crew, the Farm Animals Crew or another. This way each child gets real-life exposure and interaction with every part of life, as well as plenty of time to play and explore.

Continuing down the road following the smells of fresh-baked bread and cooking food, you approach a large dome shaped building, looking as if it is pulsing with Life; and it is. This is the Community Lodge, housing the Central Fire. Here, meals are served each day, prepared by the Food Prep Crew in the adjacent community kitchen. This is also a gathering place for meetings, ceremonies and entertainment. Elders tell stories, music is performed and children act out plays. By celebrating the many facets of Wholistic Tribal Living, the people hold this place dear to their hearts.

The people are truly happy here because they live the way humans were created and evolved to live. Conflicts are resolved peaceably by a dynamic communication the people here strive for. Everyone chooses their own type of service to the community, according to their skills and talents. Some are teachers, some are healers. Some work the fields or the kitchen. Some are builders, artists or craftsmen. All are needed integrally and equally. Many tools and crafts are produced in the community- boots and footwear, felt hats and gloves, rustic furniture, pottery, clothing, hand tools, the list goes on. These items are then distributed throughout the community to whoever has need of them. Any surplus is traded with the sister communities for things they produce-food items, tools or specialties.

Since each community is &quot;self-sufficient&quot;(but actually co-dependant upon sister tribes) they produce all the whole, natural foods necessary to support the community. Permaculture principles are employed to organically grow vegetables, sprouts, grains, nuts, fruit, meat, fish, eggs, milk, yogurt, cheese, honey, herbs, etc. The storehouses are full and excess is used to barter.

Walking down a small trail weaving through the woods, you come upon a serene lake. Nestled in on its shore is a beautifully landscaped building, blending naturally in harmony with the surroundings. This is the Healing Center. Many forms of healing are practiced here, from various types of massage and acupuncture to herbals and emergency medicine. Community people are treated freely by community people, since each contribute to the Whole Tribe. Each has their own skill or passion to offer the Whole. Everyone is fed good whole healthy food, everyone is educated well, everyone is healed, and everyone is both benefited and benefits others. We are one. Also, each Community Tribe specializes in certain areas of skill or knowledge, and therefore functions as a learning center, a living university of sorts. People are free to travel back and forth between sister Communities, seeking out new learning and teaching experiences.

You may wonder how order is maintained and who makes the decisions. The people themselves make the decisions through the respective councils. For example, the Permaculture/Aquaponic Crew decides when, where, and how to plant, tend and harvest the fields and greenhouses. The Education Council organizes the schooling of the children. The people who make up these councils and crews are composed of anyone who feels drawn to them. These and other crews work together closely with the Council of Elders, the main facilitating body. These elders are exemplary people in the community, noted for their wisdom and ability to put the good of the whole above their own. They guide the tribe to come to decisions on all pertinent issues. In this way order is maintained and each voice is respected and honored.

Because actual goods and services are produced here, money is (eventually becomes) meaningless in this barter system. An extensive trade network exists between the sister communities with outreach busses navigating back and forth, on a constant circuit, picking up and discharging people and trading goods while teaching classes and workshops across the country. There are many community outreach services provided to include the searching public in the nearby big cities- a community run natural cafe, community store offering the many crafts and products made by the tribe and a school offering many classes and workshops. At this community, there are provisions for guests and visitors to stay and a trial period for longer. Reaching out rather than isolation is our goal, living by example and lending a helping hand to the masses.

All the people here know that it is not enough to just have a &quot;spiritual&quot; community; brothers and sisters just a meditation or a phone call away. Rather, True Community, Wholistic Community must exist on all levels equally, INCLUDING THE PHYSICAL!!! The physical aspects of Wholistic Community are all about living cooperatively and in harmony with children, young people, adults and Elders. They also include taking part in and understanding all of the processes that support physical life and health! Some of the more critical examples are:
Planting, tending, harvesting and preparing living, growing plants.

Preparing, storing and cooking naturally organic, whole &amp; healthy foods.

Building naturally energy efficient homes.

Harnessing Naturally pure energy in a natural way.

Birthing, raising, lovingly caring for food animals.

Caretaking the Earth while gathering and harvesting needed materials.

Hunting, fishing and wild crafting/gathering when necessary, in a balanced,sacred manner, as has sustained all natural tribal cultures close to the Earth Mother for eons.

The list goes on. Without these interactive processes, true community cannot exist in its fullest state of teaching life's most important lessons and passing them on to the next generation. True community is WHOLISTIC and has many integral support systems that are inextricably bound together, mimicking the balance of Nature. As in Nature, take one piece away, and the Whole eventually collapses. The people here know this, they live it, the people here remember what life is really about.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22529&quot;&gt;Bloomington Christian Radical Catholic Worker Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Hospitality to the Poor, Nonviolence, Simplicity and Children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-bloomington-christian-radical-catholic-worker-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-bloomington-christian-radical-catholic-worker-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Bloomington Christian Radical/Catholic Worker (BCR/CW) is a community in the tradition of the Catholic Worker Movement.  The Catholic Worker Movement lives the vision of Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin, who believed that a peaceable revolution would result if people imitated Jesus Christ’s nonviolence (Matt 5:38-48), voluntary poverty (Matt 6:24, 19:16-26), and radical hospitality (Matt 25:31-46).  The BCR/CW is an ecumenical Christian intentional community that tries to live, pray and work with each other.  We offer housing, food, and love to people facing homelessness.  The BCR/CW is autonomous and has no institutional connection to the Roman Catholic Church.  We are not a 501c3 and donations are not tax-deductible.  We perform the works of mercy and nonviolently oppose the works of war.  We strive to practice the Sermon on the Mount, community living, voluntary poverty, personalism, and care for children and the environment.</description>

      <name>The Mothership</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22530&quot;&gt;The Mothership&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Queer-friendly child-centric community house with a focus on social justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/another-castle/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/another-castle/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Mothership is an urban intentional community living in two houses in Portland, Oregon. There are currently 11 people living here, and we are in the process of acquiring a third house which will increase our population capacity to 17, and then to build 4 additional bedrooms beyond that.

We have a fully collectivized food system with the understanding that anyone can come eat here, we share most household expenses, and a subset of us operate as a fully income sharing group.

We support each other as parents, believe children should be treated like humans, and humans should be treated well. Many of us co-parent each other's kids and we generally believe children to be the responsibility of the group.

We love welcoming guests. Many people think of The Mothership as home base and stop in to refuel, gather supplies, and plan new expeditions.

We are committed to clear, direct, and open communication, which we maintain with regularly scheduled (twice a year with each member of the house) one on one conversations and more one on one, small group, and whole community discussions on an as-needed basis. We encourage communication early and often, and we endeavor to avoid having unresolved interpersonal struggles that lead to a toxic living environment. If you've upset someone at The Mothership, you either already know about it or are about to.

We acknowledge having been raised in a culture that teaches racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, gender essentialism, ableism, body shaming, slut shaming, and the enforcement of gender roles and stereotypes. When these things inevitably fall out of our mouths, we are committed to talking about why they were problematic and how we can do better in the future.

We aspire to be a safe space for the marginalized. We have cultivated a culture that feels safe and comfortable for many queer, non-binary, and transgender people, as evidenced by our current demographics: we are over 70% LGBTQIA. Two of our eleven current members are people of color, one of whom brought forward a vision of using the large number of living spaces opening up to create a culture where people of color feel similarly safe and at ease in their homes. We are collectively working toward that dream.</description>

To make our footprint small, we identify sustainable and ecologically-efficient systems.  As we cultivate and maneuver within these systems, they define us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/vegetable-ranch/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/vegetable-ranch/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Vegetable Ranch is a large house shared by 5 adults.  Home also to a large vegetable and fruit garden, chickens, a growing apiary and fruit orchard, inhabitants of the Ranch are encouraged to participate in homesteading activities such as growing and preserving harvest, cooking meals from scratch, crafting everything from condiments to health and beauty products to household cleaning products.  Whatever products of interest which can be bought in a store, we endeavor to create at home from basic household ingredients.  At the level each person is able to contribute around lives otherwise full with work and/or school, we like to dabble in DIY projects to save money, vote with our dollars, and be empowered to meet our basic needs.</description>

The focus also is on establishing ways of self-supply (bio garden, fruit farming).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/familiafeliz-esp1/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/familiafeliz-esp1/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Familia Feliz is a decentralized living community with shared economy. Decentralized means those people live together who want to do so. The community does not dictate where a member should live or that all members have to live in one place at all times. Instead, it is part of the concept of Familia Feliz to live in different countries and different places. We start in Spain and Germany as these are the countries we already live and call our homes. Our community life is based on a shared economy, decisions by consensus, veto for each and solidarity with each member.  We respect and develop private property and focus on life in peace and freedom.

Familia Feliz is organized in units. A unit can be a working unit like &quot;bio garden&quot;  or a company run by members, as well as a a home unit, a group of members living in one house.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22556&quot;&gt;Enriched Earth Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To build an inspirational Educational Eco Village in Northern Ireland on the principals of sustainable living.

To lead, demonstrate and spread environmental innovation.

To promote community development for social change.

To develop a practical renewal of traditional culture and heritage for the times we live in and for the times to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-cauldron-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-cauldron-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Enriched Earth Ecovillage is an exciting project aspiring to create a pioneering and educational Ecovillage in Northern Ireland. For residents, guests, the local community, nationally and internationally we seek to become an inspiring example of best practice in sustainable living. We are registered as a not-for-profit Community Interest Company and intend to run series of cooperatives and other social enterprises within this legal framework.

Our Vision

A co-housing scheme, incorporating a community centre, shared facilities and social areas
Eco-education facilities and activities
Renewable energy technologies
Community allotments
Facilities and support for small business enterprises
Community festivals and events
Facilities for visitors and eco-tourists

Our Values

Exemplify best practice for sustainable living
Promote social inclusion and integration
Promote culture and heritage
Seek ecological, social and economic sustainability
Lead, demonstrate and spread environmental innovation
Promote community development for social change and peace and reconciliation
Provide for life long learning
Devise and adopt appropriate legal structures so as to facilitate and co-ordinate the development of the overall enterprise.

Enriched Earth Ecovillage shall be a place of learning; harmony, transformation, prosperity and a place where each individual shall be sovereign over themselves while working in concert with their community colleagues through shared values and vision.

Low Impact Co-Housing

We are founding members of Co-Housing NI and aim to build a series of low impact, sustainable houses. We wish these to blend into the land, with a grass roof and also to be ornate through the inclusion of indigenous style artwork. We intend to build using Hempcrete as having excellent thermal mass. These houses shall serve as homes for residents and also as guesthouses for responsible and sustainable eco-tourism of the site. We shall also have a camping and glamping area for guests and tourists and hostel accommodation.

Community Hub

We will have a Community Hub for workshops on sustainable living such as agroecology, for community meetings, for celebrating traditional seasonal festivals e.g. Lughnasa, for hosting an annual Early Gaelic Harp festival, a Poetry Festival, Community Theatre and a wide range of cultural enrichment and cross-community activities such as set dancing and yoga classes. The Community Centre will have an adjacent cafe and shop to sell local and organic produce and regional arts and crafts. This will be a place of genuine social and cultural integration, were all are made welcome regardless of age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or physical ability. True traditional hospitality shall be part of our legend! We will have a community library and also a natural outdoor amphitheatre.

Eco Education Interactive Adventure Trail

The area around the centre will be made into an outdoor Eco Education Area in the design of a labyrinth all presented in a very imaginative, fun and interactive way. The core themes of the very successful Green Flag Eco-Schools Program (with which we are in the process of piloting formal afffliation) will be referenced for example the topic of Litter will be explored via ‘The Island of the Legendary Litter Monster.’ It will be designed as an enjoyable place of education for all ages from nursery school to OAP and a great, healthy, enriching and rewarding family experience. We intend for this Eco Education area to become in itself one of the ‘must-see’ visitor attractions in Northern Ireland.

Economic Benefits

It is envisaged that this exciting initiative will not only serve to enrich the lives of its residents and guests but will also be a boon to the local economy and community through its cultural program, unique small business enterprises and through attracting the ever-growing eco-tourism market sector.

One of our primary case studies is Findhorn Ecovillage in Scotland, which brings in an incredible £2,500,000 in annual revenue, also Sólheimar Ecovillage in Iceland which is extremely prosperous and hosts 35,000 guests per year. We also have case studied the Eden project which has brought in an over £1 Billion to the local Cornwall economy. We are a not-for-profit Social Enterprise but we do intend of have our Ecovillage as a place of prosperity in all ways.

Synergised Social Enterprises 

We also seek to promote traditional crafts such as blacksmithing, pottery, soap making and willow weaving through a series of interlinked small business enterprises. We will also have a music recording studio and a multi-media suite.
Forest Gardening and Renewable Energy
We shall grow our own ‘forest garden’ food, keep free-range livestock and aim to power the site through passive solar heating of homes and renewable energy sources such as solar panels, wind and water turbines.

Wild Outdoor Spa Area

The site will also feature a wildlife and meditation pond, a natural swimming pool, an outdoor sauna, outdoor hot-tubs, a sensory garden, a wildflower meadow and an herb garden.to facilitate health in mind, body and spirit of residents, guests and the wider local community.

We Need You!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22559&quot;&gt;Valley of Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Valley of Light is a sustainable spiritual community dedicated to the Principle of Peace and to the Universal Laws of Truth, Love, and Light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-valley-of-light/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-valley-of-light/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Valley of Light is a micro-community founded by members of The Oracle Institute, a 501(c)(3) educational charity and think tank which serves as an advocate for Peace and a vanguard for Conscious Evolution. Oracle operates an award-winning publishing house, a multi-faith spirituality school, and a global peacebuilding practice. Recently, Oracle organized the “Building the New World” conference at Radford University, which FIC co-sponsored.

The Valley of Light (“VOL”) is a sustainable, spiritual community located in a high energy region within the New River Valley of Virginia. VOL is nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains in a small town called Independence. We have 22 stunning acres along the New River, which is the oldest river in the Western Hemisphere and the third oldest river in the world. 

VOL Members are aware that the world is on the verge of a major paradigm shift, the likes of which we have not witnessed in 2000 years. The worldwide resurgence of religious fundamentalism coupled with emerging New Age theosophies are just two indicators that we are in the midst of intense spiritual confusion and a looming sociological transformation. 

VOL Members also are cognizant of the many unprecedented factors contributing to this turbulent period, including: global warming, food and water shortages, pandemic indicators, terrorism, energy limitations, and a lack of visionary focus by political and business leaders. We therefore believe that the key to a smooth transition into the 21st Century is the adoption of a new way of living based on an awareness of the interconnectedness of all life. To that end, Oracle and VOL are committed to creating a model micro-community using the most advanced community on the planet as our template: The Federation of Damanhur in Italy.

Currently, VOL is building the “Peace Pentagon,” our community center and headquarters for our charity, The Oracle Institute. From the Peace Pentagon, we will expand our peace programs to include a multi-media “HUB.” VOL is designing the HUB with Barbara Marx Hubbard and a team of IT experts. Ms. Hubbard has visited the Peace Pentagon and supports a bicoastal HUB network, with the East Coast HUB at the Valley of Light in Independence, Virginia, and the West Coast HUB in Berkeley, California.

Come join us now! We are doing this! Email: teaganblackburn@gmail.com immediately with any questions!

Vision Statement

Catalyst is a forming intentional community and eco village in upstate New York.

We aspire to live and demonstrate a lifestyle of deep ecology and social cohesion. A zero carbon, fossil fuel free, energy positive community that enriches its surroundings. A community where neighbors are family and family is tribe. Each supporting the others to make a lighter and more loving load for all. A community that serves and nurtures its members so that they in turn may work hard to better serve the world.

THE PLACE
Our community will have clusters of individual eco homes, a large workshop for creation and maintenance, and the group house for low income housing and the large community center building will be the focal points of the social community. They will be artistic and bold.

The property we are currently considering is about an 1 hour and 15 minutes northwest of the city. Its 75 acres, including 5-10 acres for building and landscaping, 40 cleared acres for farming and livestock and 30 acres of forest. The property has living space for 3 founding families, plus a 10 horse stable, workshop, and large gathering space. Biking distance to two towns.

Our buildings will be aesthetically beautiful and designed to excite and inspire the soul. They will be made of natural and clean materials that are common to the area. They will feature passive and active solar, geothermal, living roofs, radiant floors, composting toilets, water catchments, constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment, recycled materials, and year around indoor plant growing.

Our shared Community Center will be a shared common space for community dinners; meetings; parties and movie nights; workshops; retreats/yoga/meditation; childcare; office space for entrepreneurial incubation; a date night room,; and other common interests of the community. It will have an outdoor hot-tub.

Our Group House will have multiple bedrooms and apartments that will be available for permanent low-income co-housing and space for visitors and guests of our retreat center.

Our clustered smaller-footprint Eco Housing Units will be available for purchase by members wishing to join the community. The will be organized into pedestrian-centric villages and feature private kitchens and living rooms.

THE PEOPLE
We are CURRENTLY SEEKING 1-4 other founding families/couples or individuals that are interested in joining us in purchasing the property. These would be people who have the resources and credit to take a home loan or own a home that they would be willing to sell.

We are also seeking designers, engineers, permaculturists, natural builders and architects that can help us design our utopia. We are also seeking lawyers with property tax experience, and bankers/lenders/investors with vision and people with Community Land Trust knowledge.

Our community will be open and welcoming to conventional and non-conventional families of all configurations and individuals of all races, genders, economic backgrounds and sexual preferences.

Our community is based on non-violence and non-violent communication. We seek kind, compassionate, intelligent, creative, smart, and rational people that share its vision and can participate in consensus decision making.

THE LAND
Our community will have several greenhouses and will grow organic food and algae year around. The algae will be used to make fuel for the community vehicles.

Our community will use community and conservation land trusts to permanently preserve both farmland and wild nature on our site, and take advantage of those tax exemptions as well.

Our community will host a biodynamic community supported agriculture project to grow our own organic food and herbs. We will grow our own and/or lease space to local farmers. Our community will keep livestock or create partnerships with local farmers in order to have local milk and eggs. Our community will have an permaculture orchard for fruit and nuts. Biodynamic principles and permaculture design will be joyously implemented.

Our community will have a large and well-equipped wood and metal shop that will be used to build, and maintain the property and also to create art and beauty throughout. Artist studios too.

SELF RELIANCE
Our community will create jobs and income through:
farming; gardening; keeping horses and renting stables; hosting workshops and retreats; arts and music events; and an eco bed and breakfast.

Our community will have a vibrant mixed-ages homeschooling group (4-11) with a dedicated classroom and a certified teacher hired by a pool of parents, inside and outside of the community. It will be play-based, experiential, Waldorf-inspired, largely outdoor education and have intrinsic opportunities for cross-pollination with the elders, farm chores, and for local community service projects, while integrating the NYS homeschooling academic benchmarks.

Our community will found an assisted care elder-care program for members as they age and for members’ aging parents and relatives, creating onsite paying jobs for our members who are nurses, healers, and health care practitioners.

Our community will seek to document all that it does in hopes of replicating and helping to create a better model for sub-urban and rural development, especially in the surrounding area. Some members will travel as part of a consulting business to start new ecovillages all over this country and in others.

Our community will have a have a blast making a difference!</description>

The Pineolia Manifesto 
January 24, 2017, Draft #4 
by Ken Nelson

Introduction

I wish to establish a future intentional community called Pineolia (Pine'-o-li-a).  What would Pineolia be like, and who would be eligible to become a Pineolian?  This document describes these things and outlines a basic framework for Pineolia.
I have a specific vision for Pineolia.  Therefore, this being the case, I need to be the sole founder including the sole owner of the land that the future community will reside upon.  I know that this goes against conventional wisdom when attempting to create an intentional community, but this is what I'm doing.  
The founder's burdens include all of the things to learn about the buying of land, finding the right property, all of the travel expenses involved, and then actually buying the property.  All of this has been accomplished.  I own 22 acres.
The founder's privilege and advantage is being able to set things up right from the beginning as I the founder would like them to be.  The Founder is automatically the Protector. The Protector protects the land.  Ownership of the land of Pineolia shall remain entirely and exclusively in my name because I absolutely know that I would never end Pineolia by selling the land or using it for some other purpose.  I know that I will keep the land of Pineolia for Pineolia and do my best to keep Pineolia in good shape and keep it going.  
Absolutely undoubtedly the land of Pineolia will be safe in my hands.  I know this because Pineolia is my life's work.  It is the meaning of my life.  It is the reason I exist.  It is my life.  Pineolia forever!  Many, many, many, years from now, upon my death, it will be stated in my Will, to whom the  Protectorship will be passed on to, someone that best fullfills the above ideal.  
The Founder is also the initial gate keeper, deciding at the beginning, who will be considered for membership.  
So far, there is only one Pineolian, ..me.  For Pineolia to reach its full potential, this needs to change.  The &quot;I&quot; will have to change to &quot;we&quot;.
&quot;Build It And They Will Come.&quot; 
Pineolia is to be an experimental combination of Nature, respect for Nature, Peace, Tranquility, Permaculture, Art/Culture, and Economics with its own money (fiat money) and money system.  Visiting and/or participating in this place would be like being in another world or a foreign country with its own unique culture.

Certain Non-compromisable Eternal Things

Certain things that I have established will stay in place for all eternity; just a few ideas that I am 100% attached to.  These are non-compromisable things and they will stay in place forever, unless by unanimous consent they are overturned.  Other ideas by other future Pineolians, that are in harmony with the final draft of this manifesto can be added as “eternal things” by the unanimous consent of the group of multiple co-owners (A.k.a. the Pineolians), and will also stay in place forever, unless by unanimous consent they are overturned.  

The final draft of this manifesto will be the beginning of the future Constitution of Pineolia.  By the time we get to a final draft, it will be a collaboration and compilation of ideas contributed by all Pineolians.


Contributions Of Ideas

In this document I am expressing my contribution of ideas for Pineolia.  It is my slice of the pie of ideas for Pineolia.  

 
I am staking out my place, my territory, defining my roles, within this future community as all other future Pineolians will do.  All staked out territories or &quot;slices of the pie&quot;, must be in harmony with that of all other Pineolians.
 
In the following list of rules, 1 through 7 are very uniquely my creation and go deep to the center of my soul.  Some are the absolutely non-compromisable ones that I hinted at above, while others do have a degree of flexibility which I will individually explain in detail below.  Beyond rule 7 there is also varying degrees of flexibility with many of the rest of the proposed rules, as is the case with this entire manifesto which is open for discussion and negotiation.
1.	The name &quot;Pineolia&quot; (Pine'-o-li-a) is the indisputable, absolutely non-compromisable name for this future intentional community.  There is no flexibility with this one. ( In the dappled light of a pine forest in late May of 1964, this word first came to me and it became the name of the original &quot;intentional world&quot; that we kids had created.) 

2.	I have created the beginning of the &quot;Pineolian Establishment Art&quot;, which so far consists of the letters, the column, the flag, etc. (All these things are explained below.)  It is hoped that other future Pineolians will add to the Pineolian Establishment Art.  I would like them to take ownership of it by giving it their own personal touch making it their's, and create yet even more Pineolian Establishment Art; cultural things of all sorts.  I would like there to be all kinds of art in Pineolia being done by others including an expansion and further enrichment of the Pineolian Establishment Art. 

3.	The Pineolian Alphabet:  Pineolia has its own alphabet, an example of Pineolian Establishment Art.  It goes way back to the original Pineolia of 1964, of kids playing in the woods.  It is actually English in disguise with the Latin letters re-designed.  It is a type of code that makes words look like they are from some exotic language.  And they are, sort of.  It's, ...PINEOLIAN!!!  They produce a certain feeling, atmosphere, or ambiance and are a unique cultural aspect of Pineolia.  There will be trail signs printed in Pineolian and there will be &quot;street&quot; signs as well, as there will be a tiny, miniature village, &quot;Pinesville&quot;, with foot path &quot;streets&quot;.  All signs will have smaller Latin letter English subtitles.  Some may have French, Spanish, German, Chinese, you name it, subtitles also.  

These letters have proven to be quite flexible over the years as their designs have evolved and improved.  Therefore, there is a tradition of flexibility with the design of the letters.  So if a future Pineolian, lets say his name is Jack, is not thrilled with his letter&quot;J&quot;.  He is free to change it to whatever he would like.  Or I will work with that person and together we would come up with a &quot;J&quot; design that he likes. 

4.	The Column Of Pineolia  (Pineolian Establishment Art)
 
Pineolia has its own column.  Eventually all entrances to Pineolia will be flanked by Pineolian Columns.  And somewhere in the middle of Pineolia will be &quot;The Great Column&quot;, a real big one!  

5.	Pineolia has its own flag.  As soon as there is more than one Pineolian, this will be the flag that we will begin with.  If after one year, Pineolia wishes to have a different flag design, we will all design a new one together.

6.	The traditional Pineolian drawing for a pine tree, as shown on the flag, looks more like a fir than a pine.  But, no problem.  Pineolian culture, going all the way back to the original Pineolia, has always considered all evergreens or conifers to simply be different kinds of pine trees.  So therefore, in Pineolian culture, a fir is a type of pine tree.  It's a quirky Pineolian cultural thing of which I am attached.  It helps to set the inner world of Pineolia apart from the outer world.  It adds to it having its own separate identity.  But at the same time, Pineolia does believe in science.  So it believes in science and it cherishes its culture.  If the two ever come into conflict over some decision that needs to be made, then science will trump culture.  Can't let culture stand in the way of truth.  But Pineolia, having its own different botanical classification system, does no harm.

7.	Pineolia will have its own inner economic system with its own money.  One Pine Buck could be worth one bucket of dirt.  One can build with dirt.  This is a hint at a basis for a mini economic system.  The money will also serve as a platform for Pineolian Culture with the Pineolian letters displayed on the bills and coins.  We will design the money together.
8.	Permaculture is the way things are grown and built in Pineolia.
9.	Building shall be done with a county permit.  
10.	The overall strategy for the growing of things is basically this:  Along the upper slope, there shall be, for the most part, deciduous trees and plants so that the nutrients flowing down to the middle slope will be beneficial for the growing of food.  The lower slope shall have, for the most part, evergreens. (Pine trees feed the soul of a Pineolian.)  This way the acidic evergreens nutrients will not flow into the food producing areas.  

Certain things I have done with the land shall stay in place, such as all the trees I have planted, the utility dirt roads and trails I have created. (Eternal Things)  And there are other things that I have planned out that also must be, such as the placement of the house that is to be built.  But I may be flexible and open to minor adjustments.  It depends on what the issue is.  
11.	Pineolia is vegetarian.  
12.	Pineolians are lovers of animals, both domestic and wild.  No animal is to be killed in Pineolia, except in a possible rare situation of self-defense or in defense of another (human or animal) against, for example, a bear, cougar, coyote, etc.
13.	Pineolians are non-smokers of tobacco. 
14.	Legal drugs, and that includes alcohol, on occasion in moderation are allowed, but it is the overarching philosophy in Pineolia that you really don't need drugs in paradise.  Pineolia is mainly about natural highs.  One exception, caffeine:  Because you need to be awake to fully enjoy paradise.
15.	Pineolia is a hate free place.  Diversity is the way. 
16.	All Pineolians practice the Golden Rule: &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot;  Pineolians are respectful of the feelings of others and try to practice empathy to all.
17.	Pineolians are egalitarians. This would be enforced by all Pineolians taking turns cleaning a common toilet and bathroom.  The toilet is the great equalizer.
18.	 Pineolia is secular.
19.	Pineolians are primarily just humans, Americans, possibly Canadians or of other national origin, Cascadians, but most of all: Pineolians.
20.	Pineolians are progressives or liberals and they do take an interest in outer world politics.  Pineolians are registered voters and they vote.  
21.	As much as possible beforehand, all who come to Pineolia will have been thoroughly screened.  It will be a place where only friends, friendly neighbors, or at least friendly acquaintances will be invited.  All visitors will have to at least be a friendly acquaintance.  
22.	If there is an outsider that has been truly offensive toward a Pineolian, after the offended Pineolian fully explains the matter to all other Pineolians, all other Pineolians shall stand in support of their fellow Pineolian.  The offended Pineolian will have veto power over the offending outsider from visiting Pineolia.  Pineolia will be the home of all Pineolians.  Offending outsiders will not be welcome in our home.

Pineolians are to be like a family group.  Pineolian empathy occures first and foremost between Pineolians.  The No.1 most important persons in a Pineolians life are the other Pineolians.  That is where a Pineolian's loyalty would lie.    
23.	Friendly outsiders to Pineolia are honored with the title: &quot;Friend Of Pineolia&quot;.  If they have helped Pineolia in some way then they are honored with the title: &quot;Honorary Pineolian&quot;.  And if they have helped Pineolia TREMENDOUSLY, then they are declared to be a &quot;Hero Of Pineolia&quot;, the highest honor Pineolia has to give.  (At this point in time there are now five: Diane, Matt, Shari, Greg, and Nancy.) 
23.	Pets Policy: Only small indoor pets or pets in a confined outdoor area shall be        allowed.
24.	Any valuable mineral or natural resource, and any buried or hidden treasure, found in Pineolia by anyone is automatically absolutely entirely the property of Pineolia.
25.	Pineolia shall be a place of a small number of people.
26.	The words that would describe the scale of everything about Pineolia is small, tiny, and miniature.
27. Pineolia shall be totally in line with respecting the environment.
28. Pineolia shall carry on in such a way as to make the amount of discouragement toward the presence of  wildlife, insignificant.
29.	Pineolia shall bring no harm to any neighbor.  Pineolia shall be devoted to the peace and tranquility of the neighborhood. Pineolia strives for total goodwill, peace, and harmony with its neighbors and the greater surrounding community.
30. Outside the trailer and house, no loud music will be allowed.
31. Pineolia shall be a place of tranquility.
32. A Pineolian is a quiet person and lover of peace and quiet.
33.	Pineolia, except for mainly natural features, shall strive to not be seen from the Deggan's (neighbors) cabin.
34.	Pineolia shall not be heard from the Deggan's cabin.
35.	Ravel's Bolero is the new national anthem of Pineolia.  Check this out.  I think it is truly magnificent.  Play it loud!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-4J5j74VPw  This shall be until, if and when, the future Pineolians decide to change it to something else.

MEMBERSHIP:

As the founder, in the beginning, I will choose who can join.  Persons from all parts of the human family are eligible for consideration provided they are in agreement with the contents of this document.  Naturally I will choose folks that I am in the best harmony with.  

 The founder could consider up to six people all at once, or one at a time.  But as soon as there are more Pineolians than just the Founder, all Pineolians how ever many there are, will decide together who will be considered for membership.  

At this time, so far there are minimal living accomodations for only one person, me.  Applicants and I would have to work things out to increase living accomodations.  We would have to build a house together for us all to live in and equally share the cost and the labor.  This could be a wonderful bonding experience.  The Trailer could eventually become the guest quarters.    

I feel that the highest number of Pineolians that would be appropriate for this size property (22 acres), and for the maintenance of the peace and tranquility of the neighborhood, would be 7 quiet type people.  

1.) Screening:

First, all applicants and I, individually, have to get to know each other, which does take some time.  The ideal way would be for the applicants to live somewhere around here.  The next best thing would be through many correspondences and frequent visits  During this period, we would repeatedly review this manifesto constantly checking the level of harmony between us.    

This would be a long process but it is a crucial one.  &quot;Good things don't come easy.&quot;  All aspects of an applicant must be thoroughly checked out, and this takes a considerable amount of time.  And that's the way it must be and has to be.  It absolutely has to be a good fit and it takes time to see if that is the case.  A very serious matter indeed!  To be a Pineolian is to be a member of a family like group.  So the application process has to be a very serious drawn out affair, but yet with a lot of good cheer all the way through.  I can't think of every scenario that might come up.  So after all is said and done, it has to feel right to me, and if it doesn't, then it is a no go.

2.) Signing:
If all goes well with the screening process, then the next thing would be to sign a legally binding agreement.  A lawyer would be consulted in the composing of this agreement.  By signing, the applicant would be stating that they agree to abide with the contents of the final draft of this manifesto, and there would be a guarantee that the signer is getting what they are paying for.   


3.) One Time Membership Investment of $1000. 
 
I, The Founder, have invested a rough estimate total of $27,000.(Haven't yet taken the time to total it up exactly.)  But being that I am also The Protector, which means that the land of Pineolia stays in my name, the membership investment for all Pineolia applicants shall be only $1000.  The $1000 is paid directly to me all in one lump sum.  Only after a total of $1000 has been paid in full to me would that person become a full fledged Pineolian with all of the full rights of a Pineolian.  

Refund policy:
After moving to Pineolia, for every month living there, that would be $100 less that would be refundable should they then decide that Pineolia is not for them.  After ten months are up, there would be no more refund. 

So if you pay the $1000, what do you get and what are the guarantees?

For $1000 you get a life time membership in Pineolia. You are a Pineolian for life.  You can live in Pineolia.  You share equally in the community of Pineolia and in all the things outlined in this manefesto, plus what ever additional harmonious things you and other Pineolians bring to Pineolia.


The matter of membership is a work in progress, like everything in this Manefesto.  What I have written here is the best I can think of up to this time.  If you have a better idea or ideas, please let me know.  This entire manifesto is open for discussion and negotiation.


Business Ideas For Pineolia:
Three ways I have thought of in which Pineolia could possibly support itself are: 
A.	Farm. 
B.	Small scale camp ground.
C.	Unique Tiny Village
A. Farm.
Using Permaculture techniques we could grow food and sell it at farmers markets.  I think this would probably be the primary way that Pineolia could make money to support itself. 
B. Small scale camp ground.
A limit of up to 7 quiet persons at any one time with whom Pineolia has a friendship may camp-out in Pineolia.  All campers would pay U. S. money to be there and would pay perhaps $10 per 24 hours.  It could be a vacation destination. 

Up to 7 quiet Campers with whom Pineolia has a very well established friendship would be allowed to build seasonal shelters.  They would be built one at a time.  All seasonal shelters would be of a Natural Building type of construction including Strawbale, Earthbag, Cob, Roundwood, etc., and will cover an area no bigger than 100 sq. ft.  This would be an opportunity to experience building in these ways.  They would have no plumbing or electricity and are intended for camping-out during the warmer months only.  The campsites would be closed during the winter.    

All friends who opt to build a seasonal shelter would have to sign an agreement that spells out the conditions under which they can build and thereafter camp out inside what they created.  Friends of friends could camp out in these shelters provided that they are also Pineolia's friends.   

Most of these seasonal shelters would be grouped in and around the tiny, miniature village.  Some may be off by themselves.    

Campers and visitors would use the toilet and shower in the full-fledged house, that is to be built.  The bathroom would have a door to the outside for easy access.  

C. Unique Tiny Village 
It would consist of a variety of hobbit like structures of different types and designs built the natural building way.  People would exchange U.S. Dollars for Pine Bucks as there would be some fascinating little shops producing a product or providing a service, all to be paid for in Pine Bucks.  All U.S. money collected would go to the Pineolia general fund.  
My thing will be to have a little ceramics studio where I'll teach people how to work in clay for a fee in Pine Bucks.  For those folks who have already found their way with clay, they could rent space with Pine Bucks to work in clay.  I'd also produce my ceramic art and sell it for Pine Bucks only.
Pineolia would not be open to the general public.  It would be open exclusively to friends, friends of friends, and friendly acquaintances only, so as to guarantee to keep it nice and personable.  On occasions when the village is officially open, it will be limited to no more than around 12 quiet friends at any one time; invitation only.  

Final Thoughts:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If Pineolia itself is not producing income, then each Pineolian would of course be required to chip in equally to pay the money that is needed to cover expenses such as the ongoing utilities and yearly property taxes.  This would require Pineolians having jobs outside of Pineolia or at least have money from somewhere available to contribute.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to do all of the above simply to do it, not to make a big profit.  Of course I would want Pineolia to make at least a little money, enough to pay the taxes and operating expenses, with a little left over for a rainy day fund for those unexpected expenses and emergencies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this project I am continuing to move into unexplored territory; unexplored by me, that is.  This has been the case ever since I began looking for land to buy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If this seems like paradise to you, if this resonates with you, and if you feel that your ideas would harmonize with these ideas, then lets talk.  This manifesto is open for discussion and negotiation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well that's it up to this point in time.  Your questions, criticisms, thoughts, and comments are all very welcome.  Thank you.</description>

* We value the lives and rights of all creatures equally, not just humans. We believe an animal should only be killed, either to eat or because it was attacking you or someone you are charged to protect.
* We value the natural world and believe it is healthier for our bodies to follow natural cycles. As such, we tend to celebrate seasonal cycles like spring time or the full moon.
* We value survival skills and believe that the skills needed to build shelter, find food and water and protect yourself and you family from whatever threat, are skills that all creatures need, even humans. We recognise the possibility of a major war or natural disaster and we want to be as prepared as we possibly can be for it.
* We value emotional bonds and community above material pursuits. We believe that doing daily tasks (cooking and gathering food, planting etc.) with people who have a vested interest in each other strengthens the spirit and builds trust. We think that people need to rediscover their own personal value to society. Everyone needs emotional security, why not give it to them?
* We value consent and believe that everyone should be offered the chance to say &quot;no&quot; to anything that impacts their own body and have their wishes respected. The kind of consent often talked about is sexual, but there are many other things that are done to us in the external world, non-consensually. Schooling and education, pollution, fashion and nudity, medical treatment, communication (the right to peaceful protest) and a multitude of trivial or social rules made by external entities to control every tiny thing, all come into this.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22586&quot;&gt;Ten Thousand Hands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To establish an egalitarian community centered in meditation, simple and sustainable living, service and social action. A place where we honor each other as treasures, beholding each other and relating to each other with mutual appreciation and gratitude. A place where community is a practice and invitation to be companions of the way, friends who encourage, inspire and lovingly support each other in embodying a true and meaningful life, a free and liberated life, grounded in peace, kindness, compassion and great joy. 

The community will also be headquarters for Ten Thousand Hands a 501(c)3 nonprofit motivated by an appreciation for the preciousness of all life, our relations with others and the world; our interconnectedness with all and boundless compassion. TTH is dedicated to the meditative life, to hearing the cries of all in need and responding with compassionate aid and together action for people, animals and the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ten-thousand-hands/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ten-thousand-hands/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Interested in Living in A Dharma House, Intentional Community-A Sangha, and a Non-Profit all in one/An Egalitarian Dharma Community That Is Family and Pet Friendly

Ten Thousand Hands is an unaffiliated and nonsectarian meditation organization. We are looking to establish an intentional community, urban and/or larger rural eco-village with an aim of living a simple meditative life, developing friendships with like-minded people, and supporting and encouraging each other in practicing and embodying the dharma. We will nurture our practice with sharing silence/group meditation, some shared meals and chores, monthly community meetings and organizational roles. 

In addition to meditative work our work encompasses areas of food; shelter, hospitality and housing; clothing; outreach and care for incarcerated and formally incarcerated; the sick, elderly and dying; care for the dead; animal rescue, rehabilitation and sanctuary; sustainability (farm/food, housing, transportation), conservation and reclamation. Advocacy and activism for peace (opposing war and violence), justice, human and animal rights, sustainability and environmental care.

Group meditation which shall be open to the public, includes silent sittings interspersed with short walking periods followed by tea and occasionally a talk. One may meditate in whatever style they wish within the silent sitting and walking format. Private meetings with a teacher shall be made available throughout. All activities are optional though we ask that residence have a commitment to meditation and respect silence during designated silent times. There is no requirement to adopt any philosophy or beliefs to participate nor are there any rituals or ceremonies.

The living environment shall be both vegetarian/vegan friendly and ecologically friendly including preservation of nature and wildlife, as well as organic conservation farming. Food shall be mostly organic consisting of local produce. Meals offerings shall be vegan/vegetarian and sattvic/ayurvedic. Some shared meals shall be taken in silence and some in open fellowship (with talking).

Our structure is egalitarian with all major decisions made by the community as a whole in the manner of Friends (Quaker consensus).

Some of us may work outside jobs, others may work more around the house and on community projects, including outreach, community cottage industries/not for profit businesses and raising funds via donations.

Although all are welcome to apply, preference in available residential opportunities is given to those who consider their practice the center of their life and wish to deepen in it by contributing to a meditation community. We are also interested in those who hold knowledge/expertise in the areas of administration, public relations or development, fund raising, social media, and any area in which services are being offered.

All activities and services shall be offered as a gift, by free will donation basis.

We will purchase property to make it a permanent community, but for now we may rent one residence large enough for everyone.

VALUES AND CUSTOMS WE CHERISH AND SHARE
Repentance/penitence, atonement, kindness, compassion, honesty, humility, love of work and the arts, down to earthness, meditation, humor, simplicity/frugality, peace/non harming/nonviolence, freedom, self-reliance, selfless service, unpaid service to others, hospitality, holding goods in common, homelessness, charity, social justice, nonviolent resistance/direct action, wisdom and liberation. However, wisdom, compassion and liberation are given the highest emphasis, being the ground upon which all other customs arise.

      <name>East of Eden [Nature Preserve]</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22590&quot;&gt;East of Eden [Nature Preserve]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We have come to realize that the absolute essence of Community …is CommUnion. Thus do we share the grail so many seek

It is in such knowing …that the true Nature of our own Purpose is also revealed ..now it will be expressed in our connection to the rest of Nature.

To this Sacred Space – in the East of Eden – we have come, finally, to nurture what the Creator Consecrated to us in the ‘first place’ …as it was given to us! 

Yes we failed… we allowed everything precious to be exposed to insanity …we lost sight of the perfect Love that was imbued in us all and in every thing…

Yet now we come home …to the East of Eden – to heal this profound breach. 

We are free of culture, prejudice and violence. We are the Warriors of Yesterday’s Children …gathering at last.

Aho!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/east-of-eden/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/east-of-eden/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&quot;the time of the lone wolf is over.....&quot;  We are returning to our Sacred Nature... and there to affirm 'our CommUnity' ...we are at last at East of Eden. 

In this special space ...we are celebrating a dream we had always realized in our hearts  ...only now we come to manifest it in a higher vibration and in a new reality. This is our divine destiny ...at one with the trees, animals, birds, sky, water, earth, stars ...and each other.  We are family ....and our place is at the center of the dream. 
 
We have begun to be what we were meant to be. There is no mystery; it is, after all, just so simple…

Our life is focused on the fresh soil of a new world …i8t is necessary to let go of the paradigm in order to come home… Such is the sweet dream we turned to…  

Much harm has been done to Mother Earth and her Children …the whole of the Universe is aggrieved. 

Now we come forth ...reflecting in ourselves and each other …the profound Love preserved in us ....and thus express with our most humble gratitude...  &quot;we are free at last... !&quot; 

“…The time of the lone wolf is over – gather yourselves” ...so compelling, was this simple advice from Hopi Chief Martin - the whole world could have heard it if they cared. But his words were heeded by only a few: ...we were inspired; so we are here.  

In the final hour ...we turn to Great Spirit.  And in an act of mercy ...leave the 'life' we came to know ...to its destiny. 

=  

East of Eden is, then, a portal to transcend the known world …to the Dream we never forgot ...we honor the sacred path, incline to purity, and live fully, conclusively, in Love.  It is all that was ever free…  

Of course, being aware of the emergent crisis around us - unfathomable though it may be even with all our previous experience …and even as the hapless world around us succumbs to its final delusion  ...we remember to honor its teachings  with the words &quot;...never again!&quot;  

Children of the Earth ...gather in this sacred circle.... hasten the Dream ... weave the cloth ...a new dawn awaits you.

We are at the very edge of the earth - that's where Espiritu Santo is - we have learned well - we know that to protect our progeny - is to protect our destiny - we have to separate from the paradigm; it has failed... Even so we acknowledge our singular and collective responsibility – there is only one standard of accountability...  Karma is absolute and inevitable!

So we come now to the land - all ten or twelve thousand acres of it.  It is entrusted to us, by family.  Now we will take it up in pieces of twelve or more acres …and in whole.  Since we are at the end ….it is as it was in the beginning ...ours to care for!  

We recognize who is ready - they are true to their Nature – it is they who shall vest in the East of Eden destiny ...by the care they will have taken. It may take time; it may be immediate – but everyone is responsible for their own journey …the leaves are falling… 

I, papa bear, have brought forth this land from its ancient past … to be given unto your care forever… as it was given to me [for several generations] by my Kastom brothers and our extended family [in Vanuatu, only families – tribes and clans – ‘own’ land]. It is an understanding that the land will be leased  ...to the East of Eden Foundation for the purposes disclosed in its charter ....for respect.   
 
Some issues attendant upon the land bequeathed to [me] us still persist  ...but they are being settled in Kastom and will be soon ratified in Constitutional Law as well. Nonetheless our right to enjoy the land was given to me in ceremonies that made it so and was witnessed by many of the chiefs and elders of the surrounding communities. This is the serious business of Kastom [culture]. 

Now the land is to be consecrated finally ...from its foundation in yesterday's Dream ...to its destiny in our children’s hands - for this Sacred undertaking ...and from Love we will separate from all that was previously manifest, That's all there is to it. Life is free - and so are we...! 

=

East of Eden expresses no orthodoxy, no doctrine; no system of belief ...it has only the Love of Great Spirit to guide it ...we already live beyond the horizon...  I, papa bear, am no guide …it is the Great Master we serve. We have no other ‘Leader’. 

We will continue to live, build and grow a shared life in all that abounds …as ‘eco-village’ …in ‘permaculture’… but most important, in Communion with each other and the Creation around us. Memories of the still-present paradigm around us will teach us how little of it it is ‘needed’. Thus we will carry on ...until our perimeter is sealed - thereupon access will be made impassible …to learn the ways of new world.  This is our Living Dream. 

Our family will have learned how to live in Communion with Nature…  All we ever wanted or needed was here – the bush feeds, houses and nurtures us [as needed] – we will want for nothing… It is all free.

Beloved Rainbow Family ...Children of the Earth ...take your place ...now is the time you have waited for...  But consider well ...that you are ready

        “When the earth is ravaged and the animals are dying, 
        a new tribe of people shall come unto the earth from many colors, classes, creeds, 
        and who by their actions and deeds shall make the earth green again.
        They will be known as Warriors of the Rainbow”</description>

It is envisioned to be a collective house for folks in New York City who want to live communally, grow their own food and live sustainably.  We will grow food and flowers in the backyard with methods such as permaculture, biodynamic farming and vertical gardening.  We will also compost food waste, cook communal dinners and share some good times.  The community aspires to create an urban living model that's built on love and trust, and we will host group meditation and/or yoga practices to maintain a healthy and loving attitude towards each other.

In the near future, the group will work towards securing farm land in upstate New York (1-2 hours away) so that we can supplement the needs to live in the city with the option to also return to nature during weekends.</description>

      <name>Listening Tree Cooperative</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22598&quot;&gt;Listening Tree Cooperative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We intend to regenerate community as we consciously choose to create a more sustainable way of life. We will experiment with self-organizing social systems at this time of energy descent, particularly in egalitarian ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/listening-tree-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/listening-tree-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a small group that has just started a green cooperative homestead in Chepachet, RI. Two of us  purchased a farm in June 2015, and are currently leasing it to the cooperative. When we find enough members and the co-op decides to purchase it, the owners will sell the property to the coop. 

In order to balance the need for and efficiencies of community with the need for solitude and privacy, we are creating small, cabin-like shelters (including retrofitting existing outbuildings) for sleeping and other alone-time activities. We share one kitchen, and cooperatively prepare and serve dinner in the shared house to all residents on site each evening. The house also contains shared office/farm-work space, bathrooms, other sleeping rooms and a convertible guest room/yoga studio/meeting room. At this point, we envision a community of 10-15 residents will live on the farm eventually. The current septic allowance for this property is 10 people. 

Key features include:

    Regular community meetings and conflict prevention and resolution/management processes;
    A participatory democratic decision-making process, with ‘sense of the group’ practices leading up to final decisions, the N Street method for contentious issues, and a “consensus minus one” decision rule;
    Simple living, energy conservation and material cycling (e.g., compost toilets, rainwater capture, passive solar and super-insulated (e.g. passive house) buildings and renewable energy systems);
    Growing food for the community (and others when excess), using sustainable farming, such as organic methods, permaculture, and wild-simulation propogation. Three market-farm partners currently share the site, with areas designated for them and for the co-op residents' homesteading garden and animals and food forest;
    New resident screening process and trial period;
    Opportunities for agreed-upon community mind/body/spirit practice and also an acceptance of a variety of individual practices (yoga, meditation, prayer, etc.) or none;
    Sharing responsibilities and work of the homestead, honoring the particular skills members bring to the community as well as sharing basic chores, etc.
    Sharing many things, such as meals, a truck, appliances, kitchen, laundry, bathrooms, etc., to conserve resources and make community living more affordable than single-family housing. However, this is not an income-sharing community. Private ownership of cars and personal effects will be allowed and rules for borrowing established by each individual.
    The cooperative as a whole will own and share the common house, barn, appliances, solar power equipment, tractor, many tools, etc. Rules about sharing will be developed through the group decision making process (see above).
    A market farmer or farm family could buy a special share that designates a portion of the arable land for market farming, to be stewarded by the farmer(s) in a land tenure contract with the housing cooperative. See below for details.

Our community aspires to provide educational service to the state and beyond. We will promote and conduct workshops (e.g. deep ecology – the ‘Work that Reconnects’ – workshops, a permaculture charette) and host apprentices who will live with us for a summer or semester to learn community life, food and shelter provision and about local/global transition to sustainable living more generally. We may choose to partner with an existing nonprofit organization to help raise money, recruit apprentices, and provide high school or college credit.

We plan to ensure affordability and equality by setting up ownership as a limited equity co-operative. A limited equity co-op is an alternative legal ownership entity which allows people to buy into the property and own shares of the co-op and thereby be given rights to live there and use designated and shared space for living and working, while keeping equity earned at the level paid in vs. market price. This removes investment/speculation from housing and keeps it affordable in perpetuity. Purchasing or financing a share grants holders the right to live in and otherwise use the land and structures, but also to transfer this right by selling their share back to the coop. Unlike a condo, the co-op community has the right to vet new members when shares are transferred.</description>

I try to not do anything without God tell me what to do.
I was visiting Kenya in 2013 and they liked me so much so I got a property where I want to built a Temple for pray and healing.
Together with GOD did I healed people and they gave me 3 houses in the area close to Uganda.
When I was in Kenya did God tell me that this church, the last church should be built by poor people.... poor both in money and in the spirit but will wealthy later on in the spirit when see and hear how God step closer.
I have a school for refuses and orphans kids and need to build a reak school and dorm for them to sleep in and be a big family. Teaching our kids about what we are doing so they can help people in Kenya to understand how to be independed.</description>

These values are central and necessary to everything we do. We believe that with these values as the foundation of our culture, we will be able to pursue our group goals, which we have identified as wellness, growth, curiosity, creation and creativity, real food, celebration, community, and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/fiasco-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/fiasco-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;FIASCO! is the newest branch of a 50+ year collective history. We're proud to be the latest manifestation of a long lineage of rad co-ops, including Bob the House (Seattle), Even Worse House (Olympia), and Cherry Hill MDA (Boston). 

FIASCO! began in July 2014, and embraced the name when one of the founding members shared the word's supposed etymology. As the legend goes, &quot;fiasco&quot; comes from an old Italian word for &quot;flask.&quot; When glassblowers made wine bottles they had to be perfectly shaped so the bottles could stack and store well. However, sometimes the bottles didn’t turn out quite right. Instead of scrapping the problem bottles, they molded them into flasks, turning a potential disaster into a vibrant work of art. FIASCO! (Disclaimer, we don't know how much truth there is in this, but we sure like the story!)</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22603&quot;&gt;Wheelock Mountain Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To support local, regional, and global non-violent activism and to sustainably steward the land on which we live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/wheelock-mountain-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/wheelock-mountain-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Wheelock Mountain Farm is a non-profit education center and intentional community situated on 650 acres in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont.  All but 22 of the acres are held in Trust to protect them in perpetuity from development.  The land was donated to the non-profit in 1996 with the intention that it become a popular education resource center to empower people to take non-violent action in pursuit of social, racial, economic, and environmental justice.  To this end, Wheelock Mountain Farm has been collaborating with activist groups from around the region and from around the world—regularly organizing and hosting convergences, retreats, meetings, skillshares, naturalist programs and camps for the last 20 years.  We steward the land responsibly--preserving it as a refuge for people and wildlife, and cultivating it to help sustain our programs and residents.

Wheelock Mountain Farm is a 501(c)3 that utilizes a consensus decision-making process.  The Board is comprised of both resident and non-resident activists and educators.  Most day-to-day work and decision-making is done at the household level, and residents hold weekly dinner meetings to make plans, delegate tasks, and coordinate logistical follow through while the Board deals primarily with the programmatic aspects of the farm.  It is a balance built on long held mutual trust and respect.

Members of Wheelock Mountain Farm are active in a variety of organizations in the area including The Buffalo Mountain Food Coop, The Swap Sisters, Rising Tide Vermont, Vermont Yankee Decommissioning Alliance, and Migrant Justice.  Residents meet their monetary needs, including paying rent to Wheelock Mountain Farm, in a variety of ways--teaching, farming, developing programming at the local library, administrating an alternative healing practitioners' office, and co-directing an international non-profit focused on children.

Wheelock Mountain Farm's land includes a 300+ tap sugarbush, a 100+ acre pond with nearly undeveloped shoreline, large parcels of mixed hard and softwood forest, 12 acres of pasture, and one of the finest Northern White Cedar swamps in the state.  We have 2 four season homes with one more currently under construction, a three season cabin for long term guests/interns, a beautiful stone house/dormitory to accommodate shorter term summer guests, a greenhouse, and a small barn.

We are currently in the process of expanding our programs and number of residents in order to better fulfill our mission.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22605&quot;&gt;Grand Rapids Alliance of Cooperative Communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Grand Rapids Alliance of Cooperative Communities offers affordable, community housing in downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan. We foster a framework for creation and growth by connecting our members to each other and to the local community. Come grow with GRACC!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/james-russell-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/james-russell-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We provide cooperative communal housing in downtown Grand Rapids, with an emphasis on affordability and openness to alternative lifestyles. Shared work, group meals and innovation are hallmarks of this mode of intentional living. Through consensus-based decision making, the members establish systems to meet their basic needs collectively within each house and elect representatives to manage the affairs of the organization.

The initial group first formed as the Grand Rapids Dining Cooperative, which met for regular dinners in each other’s homes. Inspired by housing cooperatives in Austin, Ann Arbor and elsewhere, members of the dining coop leased the property at 535 Fulton St E in 2012, starting what would become the James Russell House.

This group of co-opers incorporated as the Grand Rapids Alliance of Cooperative Communities in 2012, and has since started cooperatives at three more locations. GRACC currently provides housing for approximately 50 individuals.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22607&quot;&gt;Jesus People USA (JPUSA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We strive to be Christ's light both in each others' lives and in our community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/jesus-people-usa-jpusa/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/jesus-people-usa-jpusa/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;“I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.”
― Mother Teresa

In 1972, JPUSA began when a ragtag group of Christians wanted to change the world for Jesus. Now more than forty years later, they are still at it. What started as simply inviting folks in for a meal became a feeding program. What began as a phone call from a mother looking for housing eventually became a shelter, and now a complex of ministries dedicated to housing and resource services. Working together, ordinary people have been able to accomplish extraordinary things.

“Many people are good at talking about what they are doing, but in fact do little. Others do a lot but don’t talk about it; they are the ones who make a community live.”
― Jean Vanier, Community And Growth

In the 21st Century, community makes more sense than ever. By pooling resources, we use fewer resources. We at JPUSA have heard a call from God to reach Chicago’s inner city and beyond with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Perhaps JPUSA’s most important benefit is helping each member grow and mature in the Christian faith through an environment of Christian fellowship, pastoral care, biblical teaching, and practical work either through our tent-making businesses or through our various outreaches to the “least of these.”

“ ‘For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me. . . Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’ ”
― Matthew 25:35, 36, 45</description>

Finally picking up momentum and VERY excited about it!

1) We're currently establishing a group residence in Eagle Rock.  We've currently consolidated our group to two houses in the same neighborhood.

2) Our next step will be to stabilize a group fund which will go towards purchasing property.  This is being done through a combination of personal endeavors, group projects, and fund raising events.

3)  Once our financial goal is reached we will reevaluate and determine whether we will first buy a house in Los Angeles or buy rural property elsewhere(the ultimate goal is to buy the rural property regardless of whether we buy an urban/suburban house or not).

4)  We will purchase a piece of land that will be shared among all members of the community.  There we will establish our final residence where we can farm our own food, build our own society, and finally feel comfortable having and raising children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-lab/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-lab/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a family.  Perhaps one can better refer to us as a tribe.

We usually all spend our Friday evenings together either working on projects, discussing philosophy, sharing meals, spending quality time together.  We host regular meetings that anyone is welcome to attend; Tuesday night open lab(where we build solar panels, mesh networks, etc), Thursday night discussion meetings(where we usually discuss philosophy), Sunday morning art classes(figure drawing/painting, etc), and many other events in between(Including a monthly dinner outing to get to know one another).

We're working towards establishing our community one step at a time through a series of community building events and fund raisers.

We are part of a larger local intentional community of loosely interconnected community homes, families and individuals, which is spiritual in nature and aims at co-creating more consciousness in self and others.  We choose to live together for many varied and personal reasons of course, but some things we have in common are: building healthy connections and relationships; exploring the behavioural patterns learned in our families of origin, learning how they still affect our relating and relationships today, and supporting each other in making conscious choices to learn new behaviours which will support us in living happier healthier lives as emotionally mature adults.  To help us to do this we have certain guidelines that we follow in our day-to-day interactions with each other.  We have weekly house meetings in which we co-create and share a meal, resolve household logistics, and share our emotional processes in ways that are uplifting to all.

And to tend the seedling as the idea of permaculture flowers into a beautiful new world by openly sharing all knowledge and skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/finca-morpho/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/finca-morpho/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Finca Morpho is a small tight knit regenerative educational experimental permaculture community on 4.2 hectares, close to the OSA peninsula's point of Cabo Matapalo, 14km south of Puerto Jimenez, Costa Rica on the road to Matapalo, the only purple gate. We are morphing ourselves and others to be more sustainable, creative, free, happy, at peace, and open-minded to all ideas and ways of lives. Being surrounded by an indescribable primal energy from the rainforest and the ocean has inspired us to &quot;Be the change we wish to see in the world&quot; - Mahatma Gandhi. By using biodynamic regenerative agriculture we are creating a system that will continue to make top soil for years to come on it's own and able to sequester carbon. We have integrated a zero waste policy and we are using all forms of human disposal and waste to enrich the environment around us. Plant and animal care for us is treating all plants and animals the way most people treat their house pets, with lots of love, attention, activities, and healthy food. We are striving towards a sustainable and self-sufficient model for others to learn from and to show others visiting the area how they can add some of these practices into their lives with little to no work involved.</description>

It is forming a model of sustainability in practice with the involvement of competent individuals and organisations. This model will be transferable to other locations in Slovenia and abroad. The Park is growing from amazing potentials of the region in Istria along the border between Slovenia and Croatia. The park relies on the work of many creative people designing a model of sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sustainability-park-istra/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sustainability-park-istra/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Sustainability park Istra is a charity project in beautiful Istria coastal region, at the border between Slovenia and Croatia. Our goals are to revitalize abandoned, vacant countryside area and create a practical example of sustainable rural development.

Since May 2014 we have hosted hundreds of volunteers from 29 countries and created an inspiring space of cooperation, creativity and harmony among volunteers and the locals.

In 2015 we plan to finish the renovation of old rectory next to the church in Hrvoji, several hundred years old and made of beautiful local stone. This will be a community's and volunteers' home and our project's headquarters. Until now, we already did a complete re-roofing, new floors and ceilings, electric wiring, inner walls and much more inside and outside of the house. Just next to the house we tend a hectare of organic permaculture garden with vegetables, asparagus, strawberries and cherries. We regularly do voluntary actions to help local community. This typically includes picking olives, grapes, cleaning overgrown terraces etc.</description>

Ever wish you had been part of the Waltons' family? The vision of Kingston House is to be the Waltons' family times three: 20 residents living together as a supportive family of born-again Christians eating together, playing together, studying the Bible together, praying together, laughing together, learning together, and creating a rich and meaningful life together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/nozark-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/nozark-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Can you imagine how awesome it would be to live in a huge house full of your closest friends? Imagine the camaraderie of eating every meal with these friends, the abundance of joyful experiences hanging out with these friends any time you want, the treasure trove of memories your children will create growing up together with their friends, the benefits of raising your children together with your friends, confident that this support network of caring friends is always there to help you watch your children so that you can get your “me” time, and help your children with their homework, and help you work through life’s difficult challenges. Imagine how comforting it would feel knowing that there will always be someone there to greet you when you came home. Imagine the peace and security drifting off to sleep each night assured that there are trusted protectors in the house who will still be there when you wake up each morning. Now imagine being able to live this dream at less cost than you are probably spending now and doing less housework than you are probably doing now, giving you more time, more money, and more energy to enjoy your children and your life. This is the vision I have for Kingston House.

The house is a beautiful, 7000-sqare-foot, fully furnished estate nestled in the majestic Ozark Mountains, with a breath-taking view of the surrounding countryside. It's only a 500-foot walk to the largest lake in Madison County, perfect for swimming and fishing. It’s also a short drive from some of the best hiking, boating, rafting, fishing, caving, nature watching, and other awesome outdoor experiences that the Natural State has to offer, and only an hour and a half from Branson, the Christian entertainment capital of the world.

Kingston House is also conveniently situated in the middle of a well-established Christian neighborhood community, called Living Springs - 21 caring and supportive Christian households, most of whom meet together every Sunday in the neighborhood community building (only 600 feet from the house) for worship, fellowship, and dinner. Can you imagine how cool it would be to live in a house where, not only is each member of the household a born-again Christian, but everyone of your neighbors is also a born-again Christian? At Kingston House, this slice of Heaven is not just a dream, it's an every-day reality.

The goal of Kingston House is not to indoctrinate anyone into any particular lifestyle or belief system, but rather to provide for you a fun, supportive, caring, enjoyable, affordable, and amazingly cool place to live and grow in your own walk with God, and where you are encouraged to develop and exercise your own individual God-given gifts.

If this vision resonates with you, or if you are just curious, I invite you to bring your family to Kingston House for a relaxing and fun-filled visit. I will do my best to make you feel at home, because it is my hope that you will want to call Kingston House your next home. But even if Kingston House is not your next home, at least you will have a uniquely awesome vacation experience that you and your children will be talking about for a lifetime.</description>

The project will be resident-owned.  Visitors will have the opportunity to learn about ecovillage life and experience the urban forest we steward while living among us in dormitory style accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/kenwood-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/kenwood-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Kenwood Ecovillage will be a mix of shared/private living/working space for cottage industries, freelancers and entrepreneurs.  The project will be resident-owned.  Visitors will have the opportunity to learn about ecovillage life and experience the urban forest we steward while living among us in dormitory style accommodations.

Living in community will enable us to share our resources and spaces, which is easier on the planet as well as on our wallets.  We will support each other in starting independent businesses and co-ops, so that we can take charge of our own livelihoods and ensure that our work is safe, socially and ecologically responsible, and spiritually as well as materially rewarding.

We invite families, elders, students, spiritual seekers and teachers, people of all ethnic, racial and cultural backgrounds, strong women, sensitive men and gender benders of all types... all “dreamers, wishers and magic bean buyers...” who are ready to pioneer a better way to live.

The Kenwood property consists of a vacant convent, chapel and school buildings on 73 mostly forested acres adjacent to the Mt. Hope neighborhood in Albany New York.

The site features 225,000 built square feet including dormitory-style living spaces, classrooms and meeting rooms, areas that can be converted to apartment living, a gymnasium, a single-family house, workshop spaces, and a chapel. The grounds include lush forests, hiking trails, playing fields and tennis courts.

The availability of this property within the city of Albany presents an ideal opportunity to live in community, learning and teaching skills for living consciously and respectfully within society and the natural world.

Some of the possible activities at Kenwood include:

    Classes and workshops
    A youth hostel
    Venue for local performances and markets
    Cottage industry incubator
    Maker/hacker space
    Monastic and neo-monastic community living
    Natural and Organic horticulture
    Child care
    Elder care
    Summer camps
    Spiritual retreats
    Catering company and special events venue
    Set for historic films and movies

What would you do at the Kenwood?

We are now assembling a team of visionaries who are committed to crafting a viable plan for the Kenwood.  We are seeking a diverse membership and strive to welcome and accept all ages, races, ethnicities, religions, abilities, income levels, skills, interests, backgrounds, genders, sexual preferences, and family types.

Our goal is to create a flexible governance structure that facilitates living within our ecological means and empowers diverse residents to work together to create a culture that truly values differences and strives to avoid privileging any groups or individuals over others.</description>

Outreach is conducted from the Center of Operations, where associates engage with outside parties who are interested in observing or participating in an MCP lifestyle arrangement.
Our lifestyle arrangements are reflective of our mission, with each being reflective of:
1 - Equitable exchanges, wherein investors agree to a fixed, reasonable rate of return on their investment (4-5% annual);
2 - Shared use of resources;
3 - Self-governed decision-making, wherein all associates participate in decision-making while agreeing to be self-responsible.
Ours is a unique community perspective that match investors with residents who prefer to live in community without longterm commitment.  We offer a structure within which the responsibilities and rewards of property ownership can be shared by those participating in its lifestyle arrangements. 
MCP does not own property nor does it employ those who participate in its arrangements.  Our role in community relationships is to broaden and strengthen them by offering communication tools, a self-governed structure, and the management of necessary financial transactions.  Our associates make the rest happen.
Those interested in association with the organization are described as:
*Active, willing participants
*Compassionate
*Concerned
*Contributive
*Engaged
*Resource stewards
*In good standing with piers and community
*Personally and socially responsible.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22649&quot;&gt;Gemeinschaft Tortuga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We want to be happy, healthy, loving, we just want the good life! That is why we’re founding this community, because in capitalism we just don’t fit in, we hate it here, we can’t stand that horrible society and we want such a different life. We want to go live on the land, put our hands to work, love, learn, do all the important things. We want to determine our own lives, together and not be determined. We want to share property, money, work, … for the benefit of everyone involved. We believe that the way we want to live is only possible in an intentional community on the countryside, neither in the city, nor alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/gemeinschaft-tortuga/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/gemeinschaft-tortuga/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We’re founding an intentional community located in northern Spain. At the moment we still live in Leipzig, Germany. Our main principles are:


* anticapitalism
* anti-esoteric / anti-spiritual / anti-religious
* antisexism
* communal economy
* consensus
* ecology
* freedom of domination / non-hierarchical structures / anarchy
* freedom in love (love who and how ever you want to)
* self-determined education
* self-sufficiency
* transparency</description>

We support food sovereignty and are focused on self sustainability.

A few terms that could be used to describe our extended-family-style community would be secular, egalitarian, autonomous, sustainable and cooperative.

We appreciate the beauty and serenity of the land. Living in harmony with others working towards a common goal, personal growth, community involvement and peaceful conflict resolution. We welcome exceptionally positive and passionate people who wish to build a wonderful life stewarding the earth for not only ourselves but for future generations. We honor and respect nature. As well as nurture the harmony within ourselves and others. Working together to create a place where love and unity is essential. Living a simple lifestyle while utilizing technology such as running water, electricity, power tools, computers, etc. to benefit the community in the most efficient manner possible. Living each day to better ourselves, our community and the environment in which we will all live.</description>

COSEC will be financed by a proportional ownership model that will allow individuals to tailor their investment level to their interest and ability level while still leaving room for low-income members who can join the community for a low-cost share and either pay traditional lot rent or contribute for their stay through sweat equity. COSEC will be a community that encourages microhousing and sustainable architecture but will also accommodate cabins, rvs, trailers and more traditional housing structures.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22660&quot;&gt;Lydia's House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The mission of Lydia’s House is to provide a supportive and stable environment for women and children in crisis. It is a place of hope and healing as well as a springboard from which guests can seek training, new skills, and work that will provide for their needs. Women live in community, share life and meals with one another, and are encouraged in their personal spiritual journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/lydias-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/lydias-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Lydia’s House is rooted in the Christian tradition, specifically in the practices of the Catholic Worker movement. While the mission of Lydia’s House is to provide housing and support for women and their children in times of crisis, it is not a housing agency. Rather, the House is a home grounded in the Catholic Worker commitments to personalism, solidarity, faith and community, practiced alongside gospel-prescribed works of mercy.

Unlike some Catholic Worker Houses, Lydia’s House is not a church or host a congregation. However, we hope that this House is holy ground:

A sanctuary for all who come through our doors
A space for meaningful dialogue about the structures and systems that keep the poor poor
A place for prayer and transformation for all, regardless of income, class or culture</description>

We are currently renting a house on the Old West Side of Ann Arbor, and we are hoping to buy a house or houses soon.</description>

We are a collection of individuals who believe that each person is valuable and deserves to be treated with dignity, respect and care. We invite all into our home for meals, gardening, prayer, among other things, and over the years we have build quite the little family around us. 

We do our best to walk alongside our neighbours in solidarity, we uphold those around us who are faced with daily injustices, we plant gardens to participate in healing of creation, we invite anyone to our table to eat amongst us, we take in the sick and care for them, and we respond to the needs of one another and others as best as we can.</description>

      <name>The Transcendent Zeitgeist Movement (TTZM)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22677&quot;&gt;The Transcendent Zeitgeist Movement (TTZM)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Simple: a chance for true happiness. Peace, Love, Respect, Trust, Togetherness
The following is a link to some FAQ regarding (TZM)  http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-transcendent-zeitgeist-movement-ttzm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-transcendent-zeitgeist-movement-ttzm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;TTZM is currently forming, we are now a small group of people who have been handed some lucky cards. We have a large source of Income to start a Self Sustaining community we are currently in the process of securing a large portion of land around 100+ acres. We currently own 36 acres and are looking to start a town or city depending on how much additional land we can buy in the surrounding area.  At this link there are 2 DVD's that are free and are suggested to gain a complete idea of what we are doing (http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/tool-kit)

The movement's principle focus includes the recognition that the majority of the social problems that plague the human species at this time are not the sole result of some institutional corruption, absolute scarcity, a political policy, a flaw of &quot;human nature&quot; or other commonly held assumptions of causality. Rather, the movement recognizes that issues such as poverty, corruption, pollution, homelessness, war, starvation and the like appear to be &quot;symptoms&quot; born out of an outdated social structure.

While intermediate reform steps and temporal community support are of interest to the movement, the defining goal is the installation of a new socioeconomic model based upon technically responsible resource management, allocation and design through what would be considered the scientific method of reasoning problems and finding optimized solutions.

This “Natural Law/Resource-Based Economy&quot; (NLRBE) is about taking a direct technical approach to social management as opposed to a monetary or even political one. It is about updating the workings of society to the most advanced and proven methods known, leaving behind the damaging consequences and limiting inhibitions which are generated by our current system of monetary exchange, profit, business and other structural and motivational issues.

The movement is loyal to a train of thought, not figures or institutions. The view held is that through the use of socially targeted research and tested understandings in science and technology, we are now able to logically arrive at societal applications that could be profoundly more effective in meeting the needs of the human population, increasing public health. There is little reason to assume war, poverty, most crime and many other monetarily-based scarcity effects common in our current model cannot be resolved over time. The range of the movement's activism and awareness campaigns extend from short- to long-term, with methods based explicitly on non-violent methods of communication.

The Zeitgeist Movement has no allegiance to any country or traditional political platforms. It views the world as a single system and the human species as a single family and recognizes that all countries must disarm and learn to share resources and ideas if we expect to survive in the long run. Hence, the solutions arrived at and promoted are in the interest to help everyone on Earth, not a select group.

 It is recommended to do some research on Peter Joseph and his Ideals. Because we have the same vision currently we are seeking families as well as educated individuals as follows: Engineers, Mechanics, Carpenters, Botanists, Doctors, Teachers, Electricians, Plumbers and many more. The deal is we will provide everything you need. We will build you a house and a school for your kids. But we need ground breakers as well as people willing to help work. We are accepting applications now. Please contact Aaron with any questions. Thank you and We Love you:) Note: will update this page as progress is made.

We are multi-generational, multifaith and multiracial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/community-of-living-traditions-at-the-stony-point-conference-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/community-of-living-traditions-at-the-stony-point-conference-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a multifaith intentional community of Jews, Christians and Muslims who live on the property of the Stony Point Conference Center owned by the Presbyterian church, open to all. Our mission is to bring together people of the Abrahamic faiths to live and work together to help run a conference and retreat center.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22679&quot;&gt;Anatopia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We want to be a living example of permaculture and community living where we all help one another to have e fun and meaningful life :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/anatopia/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/anatopia/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We, Ana and Charlie, think that living together in community improves living in many ways. It's about helping each other and not being lonely.
Ana is from Belgium and as a youth experienced living/working in communities in England and Belgium. She got married, however, and her dream got put on hold. She is a holistic nutritionist, herbalist, and eco-gardener who loves to create a better, more compassionate, sustainable, and peaceful world for animals, plants, and humans. 
Charlie is young dude, who in 2010 biked across America, and along the way became exposed to communities and ecovillages practicing a simpler way of life. Since then, it has been his mission to not only reconnect with these simpler lifeways, but to form a community where this is the norm. He loves permaculture, yurt building, woodworking, and gardening, and hopes to form some sort of community-based business from these passions.
Our four-acre property is situated in the woods north of Elkton, MD. We have cats, dogs, chickens, and sheep.. We have 5 bedrooms in a large house, a yurt, a camper, and much space available for tents (season permitting). 
Email or call us to learn more! We hope to hear from you!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22688&quot;&gt;Farmpound&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We grow things to eat so we don't have to go as far to get them.
We use things that other people throw away so we don't have to buy them.
We live together so we can get more done and have rewarding social lives.
People need food, things, and company to complete their lives. We want to have more time and resources for fun things so we work as a team to provide ourselves with necessities.
We live at the Farmpound.
So can you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/farmpound/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/farmpound/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We're an eclectic group of people looking for somebody who shares some of our goals. We want to live, grow, and learn together. Some of our job titles include mechanic, military, entrepreneur, jack-of-all-trades, artist, boat builder, and entomologist, but what brings us together is a desire to care for the land, and use what is available as a resource that can be renewed.

Chickens and ducks roam the property, taking care of bugs and providing eggs for all who live here. Gardenscapes expand out from the house, weaving between the barn, the greenhouse, the chicken coops, and the pond. Both useful and beautiful plants provide residents with nourishment for the body and soul. Over 100 fruit, nut, or medicinal plants have been planted throughout the property. People have both privacy and places to meet on the property. We maintain a hot tub, host movie nights on a projector, light the occasional bonfire, and some even attend fairs and karaoke together.

We're still learning. Established in 2012, the property has been a site for DIY skill, social, design, and garden experimentation. Some parts of the property are under construction, and others are thriving. A mix of business, education, and enjoyment drive the development of the overall suburban homestead forward.

The rent is a little less than comparable rooms because you'll be expected to contribute some efforts to the betterment of the whole. This will not impact your ability to maintain a job or social life outside of the community. Residents give 5-10 hours a week, leading and contributing to projects and chores. Shared spaces are expected to be kept clean and organized. Other projects include animal upkeep, garden care, trash/recycling, event/party planning, and construction projects.

Livestock-friendly animals are welcome, with some coordination. Rent includes utilities. There is a monthly project budget for needed group resources like seeds, construction materials, research, bees, etc. The allocation of funds is decided at weekly Sunday meetings. We've brewed beer, kept bees, made compost, constructed greenhouses, welded stoves, created swales, raised pigs, goats, and sheep, engineered coops, and bartered with neighbors.

Does this sound like a place you'd like to visit? Live? Thrive?
If so, great. Please send an email telling us a little about yourself, and we'll get back to you within a day or so if you seem like you might be a good fit.</description>

We operate off grid. It is hard to define what we do, but generally we homestead.  

Our mission statement is too long to fit below, so here is a summery; to create a place where one can directly experience what it takes to be free. To be a place of creation, where imagination can reach for the sky, while keeping our feet firmly planted. To become an ever evolving community that makes shifts in behavior based on what nature is providing. To be a catalyst for lasting change in our culture, local and global. To create leaders in the community that make decisions based on the short term as well as the long term effects on the community and beyond.  To revive wholesome traditions like food harvest celebrations. To have food celebrations regulary, pooling our efforts to make the most of the opportunity for fun, food, and learning.  To ensure that our actions on our land dont negatively affect any creature or natural resource down hill or down the line of time.  To create an abundance of food, friends, and good times, but also create hard work, discipline, and responsibility.</description>

Our focus here is spirituality, though we don’t ignore all other holistic methods for healing, personal development &amp;amp; creativity. The more you are in balance with yourself &amp;amp; your emotional, physical, mental &amp;amp; spiritual body the more meaning you have in your own life &amp;amp; a “Life is Good” attitude thrives. 
We practice sustainability &amp;amp; we want to be a model of sustainability and unconditional love, and have a show about it. If you know photography and you are quite a peaceful person, please inquire..  

We are starting to til our very first garden in April and there is much to be shared about the techniques of organic gardening and permaculture.

Looking for a group of like-minded mothers interested in sustainable living, alternative lifestyles, shared parenting, spirituality and living in harmony with life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/mother-tribe-in-nyc/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/mother-tribe-in-nyc/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I want to create a community of women in NYC — a space for living, sharing and raising children together. Next spring I will be moving to NYC with my 12-year-old daughter – we have spent the last 5 years in the Indian Himalaya’s working with women and communities and now the universe calls us to something new. Without a plan, we are leaping into the unknown, trusting in the divine and following our hearts. My greatest wish is to connect with other like-minded women — sharing journeys, stories and the tapestry of life as it unfolds together.
I would love to hear from other courageous women who would be interested in co-creating and sharing this journey with us in NYC.</description>

      <name>St. Joseph Farm</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22700&quot;&gt;St. Joseph Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; MISSION
St. Joseph Farm is a Catholic intentional community of young adults striving for holiness within modern society by building our daily lives upon the four gospel cornerstones of prayer, service, simplicity, and community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/st-joseph-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/st-joseph-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;VISION
We will be centered on the Eucharist and open to the Spirit.  We will resist the popular culture as much as it is a “culture of death” and participate in it as much as it is a “culture of life.”  We will respond to the needs of our local community and seek solidarity with the ones we serve as they lead us into a closer relationship with Christ.

With St. Joseph as our patron, we will especially seek to reflect and promote ideas often associated with him:  Just, quiet, chaste, teacher, protector, and carpenter.
•	In being just we will seek to live out Catholic Social Teachings, recognizing the dignity of all human life and creation.
•	In being quiet we will seek simplicity and humility in our actions, for “the fruit of silence is prayer.” 
•	In being chaste we will reject a popular culture of sexual objectification to allow ourselves, with clean hearts, to “see God.” 
•	In being teachers we will provide opportunities to others for spiritual and practical growth.
•	In being protectors we will both seek sustainability as stewards of God’s creation and defend the most vulnerable in society, for “the Church considers matters concerning the environment and its protection intimately linked to the theme of integral human development.” 
•	In being carpenters we will work, often with our hands in the garden or home repair projects, and we will recognize the dignity of human work.</description>

Right now we have facilities for Shabbatons and other gatherings, where like-minded souls meet regularly. A property is being sought after by myself and others for a Intentional Jewish Community. Our current resources enable us to have gatherings year-round. Many people have an ideal notion of Community without ever having hands-on experience to determine if they enjoy the lifestyle. Another obstacle to living Intentionally is the difficulty in forming relations with those who not only share the same values but are committed to living in an Intentional Community. An opportunity thus is provided for individuals and families who are considering Intentional Community, to live in and experience community for a week, a month, a season. Bonds will be formed and a network will be created. Living together on a part-time basis will help to determine where, with whom, and how we want to live together before making a dramatic, life-altering decision to join an IC. In this fashion we will slowly but surely reach a critical mass of people and resources. This network will then begin the process of forming a permanent community in the place of our choosing.</description>

Individual co-ops will leverage the economies of scale from the larger ecovillage consortium. The use of co-op business structures provides legal advantages for social investment, access to co-op organizational support and grants, as well as co-op bank bond offerings.

We seek to cultivate a culture of gratitude and acceptance within and beyond our walls. We hope to nourish ourselves, nourish our city, and nourish our world.

Our members hail from various walks of life: teachers, developers, writers, artists, wanderers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. This home resonates with our five PACTS (Participation, Authenticity, Collaboration, Transformative Experiences, and Sustainability) and a shared value of gratitude. We host regular culinary and musical events; we organize for social good in the Lower Haight and beyond; and we are working together to grow this community into something even more wonderfully effusive.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22720&quot;&gt;Binary Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The purpose of this community is to alternate capitalism with a self-sufficient economy, based on the theory that man needs both in order to fulfill his intrinsically ambivalent nature, i.e. respectively the &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;static&quot; ones (please refer to my blog if you have the patience to read it ) .
I plan to expand its presence worldwide .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/binary-model/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/binary-model/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The &quot;static area&quot;  (as I call it) is represented by an overgrown gently sloping hazelnut grove and woodland which ends in a strip of plain , bordered by a delightful creek which (usually) runs all year long, providing for the irrigation of vegetables and corn fields. The land is set in a national park, so all manner of wild animals including wild boar roam freely and hunting is allowed.
The adjacent lands are all abandoned and can therefore be purchased at  very moderate prices, thus allowing the potential expansion of the community up to about a 4 hectare area in total.
There is also a spontaneous spring which runs all year except in summer and a well can be easily dug (probably even by hand) as water is a few meters below the surface. 
The climate is very temperate due to the low altitude and surrounding woodland. 
Construction would be allowed if one of the adjacent lands were to be purchased, as it is sufficiently far away from the stream.
It's also possible to connect to the grid, but solar energy is more in line with my purpose.
As everywhere in Italy, civilization is always very near. Yet, this place is, by its orography, very private. Although there are farms and people all around , the sensation of being fully immersed in a solitary wilderness is overwhelming.
I build everything with what I have at hand. I have recently constructed a gross but extremely functional chicken coop which neither foxes or weasels have succeeded in penetrating in spite of their obvious endeavors. The laying hens I raised in it , which are free to roam the land by day, appear to have developed an unusual wisdom and balance which make them very friendly and disciplined. They are so confident that they like to hitch rides on my shoulders or follow me around while they hunt for insects and grubs.
I get my internet connectivity only via a mobile 3G signal on a tablet which I charge via solar .

The idea is to move into this environment permanently, albeit gradually. For the time being, I still have a convenient  umbilical chord tying me to the &quot;civilized&quot; world by dint of a comfortable villa located about 8 miles from said wilderness, which I can reach even by bicycle. This large house is composed by three independent areas all equipped with relevant kitchens and bathrooms. This is an urban dwelling (albeit situated in the country, 15 miles from Rome) and offers perfect connectivity to internet, mobile and landline, apart from breathtaking views, a lovely garden with fruit trees and a swimming pool. From there, I occasionally jet off to wherever I can find I.T. contract work in Europe. My intention is to turn part of this house into a language school ( I'm fluent in five )  and cooking workshop with B&amp;amp;B or hostel facility .

I would ideally prefer to join forces with people who would like to participate in this venture. They wouldn't have to contribute financially , although that would be my preference , but would need to help me take care of the villa and the land, especially when I'm away for work. 
I would ideally like to purchase a flat land that would allow for taking off and landing with an ultralight aircraft and keeping a couple of horses, but although I don't lack the funds, this would have to be found at some distance from my present farmland, as the landscape would not allow for it.
I am also poised to purchase a small sailboat to moor in British waters, with which to escape on long sailing trips.
Self-sufficiency, in my mind, also includes transportation ...
And this project is very much about play and adventure as well, so the above would not be incoherent with it.
I have some funds  available for all of this. It's more a matter of energy, enthusiasm  and sharing.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22721&quot;&gt;Baltimore Free Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Baltimore Free Farm is committed to creating ecologically sound alternatives by combining the best technologies of modern and age-old practices. Baltimore Free Farm strives to promote urban agriculture, sustainability, and permaculture through the creation of green spaces and community sanctuaries which utilize reclaimed materials whenever possible. By providing entertainment, educational opportunities, and ethically produced food to local residents, we hope to instill a sense of pride in one's community and its ability to sustain itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/baltimore-free-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/baltimore-free-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Baltimore Free Farm is an egalitarian collective of gardeners and activists who aim to provide access to healthy food for all.

Horizontal Housing Co. is a non-stock corporation formed by members of Baltimore Free Farm in 2013. Because Baltimore Free Farm is a project under the umbrella of the 501-c3 organization Fusion Partnerships, it cannot collectively purchase property. The sole purpose of Horizontal Housing Co. is to purchase property for utilization by Baltimore Free Farm members as either gardening space or housing. In 2012, our good friend and Baltimore Free Farm member Paul Pojman passed away, leaving behind a house which BFF collective members lived in but did not own. Working in conjunction with Paul’s family members and NASCO, an organization which helps co-ops and housing collectives purchase property, Horizontal Housing was able to purchase this property and continue housing several BFF members on campus.

In addition, Horizontal Housing was able to purchase two lots from the city that are a part of Baltimore Free Farm’s gardening space. Like much of Hampden, these lots were under threat of housing development before Horizontal Housing was awarded the rights to purchase the land and it will now remain part of our garden for many years to come.</description>

Today the community exists in Kamas and the Strawberry River Canyon, Utah, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Chapala, Mexico.

This group of devoted brothers and sisters live simple devotional lives, hosting retreats, events, and devotional stays and traveling where invited to share gatherings that inspire and bless all who seek peace of mind and enlightenment. They are often referred to as &quot;Messengers of Peace.&quot; Acknowledging that truth is in the Mind, they offer an invitation to engage in the uncovering of the beliefs that seem to obstruct the awareness of love’s presence.

They meet with those who desire to discern between the ego’s thought system and the Holy Spirit’s purpose of forgiveness. The purpose of the gatherings remains unchanged: learning the Spirit’s purpose of forgiveness and awakening to Peace, Happiness, and Freedom.

They serve as mighty companions for each other and recognize that awakening is not a casual endeavor, but one that demands a deliberate and uncompromising commitment. The depth of devotion and faith reflect their willingness to question all assumptions. Total transformation of the mind is approached with passion and devotion and a burning desire from within. This is their unified goal and purpose.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22723&quot;&gt;Ananda Laurelwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Ananda Laurelwood offers the opportunity to live in community with other inspired, like-minded people who share a foundation in universal spiritual principles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ananda-laurelwood/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ananda-laurelwood/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Since 1968, Ananda has been a pioneer in small, conscious communities. Beginning with Ananda Village, this pattern of life has spread around the globe, with Ananda communities in Europe and India as well as here in the US. Ananda Portland has had a community in town since 1993, and it serves as a sister to Ananda Center at Laurelwood.  

Building a small community is an art, born of experience, character development, time, commitment and joy. Using the resources at hand, an individual can have direct experience of every aspect of community life at Ananda Laurelwood while also developing the spiritual and character qualities which make for supportive leadership, creative management, dynamic involvement and a richly evolving community life.  Situated in a beautiful pastoral valley, our surrounding farm, gardens, forest and wild-lands provide natural beauty, quiet, and a buffer from the conflicting vibrations of more urban environments. Yet when the world beckons, Portland is just a short drive away.  

Our 55-acre educational campus hosts a Meditation and Yoga Retreat center, a growing organic farm with wwoof opportunities and weekly public volunteer projects, a fully residential internship program, and certification programs in vegetarian cooking and conscious compassion-based eldercare.   Our center is a place of learning and connection, inwardly with the Divine through the practice of meditation and yoga, and then expressed outwardly in our shared activities: vegetarian meals, meditations, service, classes, and recreation.  Students in our residential Cities of Light and Karma Yoga internship programs have a private room with bathrooms just down the hall and three vegetarian meals are served each day. We believe in serving food filled with prana – or life energy. Thus we source organically grown and local ingredients as much as possible.

You can begin your journey in conscious community living by participating in the residential Karma Yoga Internship Program for anywhere from 2 weeks to three months, which integrates spiritual practice, service, personal support, and study of the universal teachings of Self-realization.  Visit our website at http://anandalaurelwood.org/spiritual-internships/ for more information. If at the end of your three-month internship, you’re interested in participating in the long-term Cities of Light residential program, you can apply and interview for acceptance. Costs and fees will be assessed at the time of the interview.  

The long-term Cities of Light residential program is tailored to support those who seek to develop the understanding, the skills and the character that allow for the development of community wherever life might take them.  Some members contribute their time in service to the center while others commute to nearby cities for work. 

On the 175 acres surrounding our campus we are developing an intentional community, what Paramhansa Yogananda called a World Brotherhood Colony, where all of life can be together in one place. We are striving to create a community where the values of simple living and high thinking can be put into practice as an alternative way to live that is more sustainable, and ultimately more fulfilling, where people can find what they truly seek: happiness.</description>

Five Families. Four units plus a common space (two families share a unit). Quarter-acre lot with lots of fruit trees (hence the name). Solar panels, rain catchment, greywater, urban gardening, etc. Lots of children. 

Some of us go back to college days living together in shared rentals. Did the same for many years in San Francisco. Then in Berkeley. Finally bought a place together in Berkeley where we lived as a co-op house for quite a few years. But the goal had always been full cohousing, so after about a 10-year process, we achieved that in wonderful Oakland, California.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22731&quot;&gt;Sunburst2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our vision is to create an ecologically sound, self-reliant community, combining the latest technological advances in bio-culture and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sunburst-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sunburst-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Sunburst is a community whose ideology revolves around combining alternative-technology education with holistic living. 

We are an interconnected network of allied small groups of people living communally in New Hampshire, USA.

We provide our essential needs for food, shelter, energy, healing, companionship and self-actualization by sustainable growing practices, by harvesting renewable energy for heat, electricity  and mechanical work, by caring for animals, wild and domestic and by sharing life with each other.

We commune with each other with shared meals, dances, optional spirit practices as well as regular meetings and shared work on the grounds.

We generate value for ourselves, for each other and for our neighbors by selling extra food and plant medicine, education, forest products, alternative energy technology , natural healing and other  business ventures.

Our land {Each site} holds a group of private, personal homes, emphasizing small, energy efficient and simple buildings made from local materials, with centralized community space for dinners, music, dancing, lectures and movies. 

Natural healing is accomplished through  the innate healing abilities of our bodies, assisted by practitioners of chiropractic, massage, meridian therapy, herbalism, reiki, counseling and yoga. For our purification, our community has facilities for bathing, swimming, hot water soaks, sauna and sweat lodges.

Food production is  from foraging, gardening, greenhouse hydroponics, aeroponics, aquaculuture, farming, permaculture and agroforestry.

We intend our community to be an exemplary model of responsible living on planet earth, teaching others our culture, on site and on www.

Visitors are encouraged to come and learn, for a few hours, a few days or a few weeks, with several options for exchange of value.

Some of the interests and skills of current community members are solar and wind power, compost heating, filtered rainwater, natural-style parenting, greenhouse farming, homeschooling, music, and worker-owned cooperative businesses.

The community plans to be self-supporting, providing jobs through intense aquaculture, hydroponics, beekeeping, internet business, recumbent-bicycle making, soap making and perfumes. Sunburst is a home for those who share high ideals and who know that tomorrow is built today. We are presently in the formative stages: We now own 140 acres (50 acres of farmland, 48 acres on a lake Lake Wentworth and 42 acres where we are building our home ), located close to each other . (We are joining another community with 42  acres on which to build our buildings and residential housing). 

We want our members to reside in &quot;tiny homes&quot; , members can bring their own or reside in ours. 

 We are building the relationships and the organizational foundations of a community. We are planning on building a cluster of energy-efficient domes and developing a conference and education center which will demonstrate conservation of energy resources and sustainable agriculture.

This coming spring (17) we are purchasing and constructing two large greenhouses, to house our tomato and vegetable crops.  Also will be building/buying two &quot;storage containers&quot; where we will building a barn out of them. 

 We welcome people who have  &quot;tiny homes and/or small homes on trailers&quot; to join us at our community now. We are in the process of purchasing a community building where we will  have meetings and group  dinners.  The community house will include a pro-type aquaculture system utilizing fish and vegetables. Also we plan to  install a underground thermal storage tank for our compost heating system combined with our solar hot water and rocket stove's.  This spring we will be putting up another greenhouse for our hydroponic gardens.  In addition we will be building a &quot;living pond&quot; and constructing two sheds to house  our rabbits and chickens.

Like-minded persons who are ready to develop and explore themselves in a setting of openness and trust are invited to inquire about Sunburst, either as prospective members or as investors in a socially responsible alternative environment</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22732&quot;&gt;Social Progress Agents Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to support social entrepreneurs in their mission to serve and enhance society and the environment society depends on.  We do this by providing a place where we can live, work, and learn together. We have a library that can help us accomplish our missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/social-progress-agents-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/social-progress-agents-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I have the opportunity to create a community in this place I moved to, a community for social progress agents who want to help improve society and the environment using a cooperative leadership model.
I think an intentional community is much more different than a co-working space. An intentional community offers more benefits than a co-working space too. The other benefit is that you save a lot of money living in a 6 bedroom house with sufficient parking. This place has so much potential to help Social entrepreneurs serve their communities. Being part of community allows you to reduce expenses in many ways including food costs, because we can cook for everyone. I can even bake bread saving $4 dollars per pound of bread. We can also co-own or share cars to reduce expenses on vehicles and insurance. 
 
Benefits of living at the social progress house:
•	Reduce expenses by sharing things or cooperatively owning things like a plug-in hybrid electric car, car insurance, tools, bikes, computers, common area furniture and spaces, farm land, farming tools, food.
•	10-minute driving commute to VCU and downtown.
•	Co-working spaces
•	High-speed Internet WiFi
•	Rent is affordable under $350 - $500 per room and probably cheaper when we find a place we all want to co-own.
•	Be with like-minded people
•	Lots of books. We have a library that will help you develop yourself and your social enterprise aimed to help benefit the world and society.
•	We have plenty of refrigerator space with two extra fridges not being used. 
•	There are places to put your bike and your car.
•	There are around 8 parking spots in the parking area behind the house and off the road.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22735&quot;&gt;Nottingham Cooperative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We want to show that cooperative housing is a viable way to live in the modern world.  We just try to all get along and to make things work as best we can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/nottingham-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/nottingham-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Nottingham is one of Madison, Wisconsin's, oldest housing cooperatives.  We are located right on Lake Mendota between the University and the Capitol building.  

Our house, with about 22 private rooms, has hosted a variety of events over the years in the common areas.  We've hosted various parties, plays, musical acts, open mics, and so forth.  

We have two scheduled house meetings per month where we discuss house affairs and responsibilities.  We usually have a house meal together each evening around 6 or 7.  

Members have a wide range of interests but generally lean toward the artistic side.  We also do some gardening and take turns making dinner.  We try to split up house responsibilities as best we can so that no one is burdened too much.  We do have students living here from time to time but we are not strictly a student housing cooperative.</description>

      <name>Community for Mindful Living - Berkeley and Bolinas, CA (San Francisco Bay Area)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22743&quot;&gt;Community for Mindful Living - Berkeley and Bolinas, CA (San Francisco Bay Area)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Who are we?

We are a community of people who feel modern society is going a bit too fast.  While we accept it and live within the modern world, we also try to live in a slower, simpler, and more balanced way.

We’ve created this website to lay out a vision for living in community and connect with other people who are interested in joining and molding our efforts.  We are families, couples, and individuals committed to cultivating a practice of simple, healthy living within a modern community that we collectively create.  It would most likely follow the model of a cohousing/ecovillage community (private units with shared common house, gardens, etc.), but with a deep commitment to being a place of personal and collective transformation, for both residents and visitors.

For those of you familiar with the Plum Village tradition, one of the community models we admire, one could think of our efforts as a desire to create a year-round lay person Plum Village environment for us all – though not “religious” or tied to any single religious tradition.

We feel the dominant cultural focus on the “individual” and “independence” has gone too far and we’re beginning to lose our innate understanding of how all things are interconnected.  We choose to intentionally live in and build “community” – so that we can learn to be more “interdependent” and to better maintain healthy relationships with ourselves and others.

We consider living in a supportive community a valuable opportunity for both personal and societal transformation.  The benefits for our children, ourselves, our neighbors, and our planet are innumerable.

Are we a Meditation Community?  

Meditation is a practice for many, though not all, of us.  However becoming more present and insightful by cultivating mindful awareness of the present moment is something we all aspire to.

What is Mindfulness?

“Mindfulness is a state of active, open attention on the present. When you’re mindful, you observe your thoughts and feelings from a distance, without judging them good or bad. Instead of letting your life pass you by, mindfulness means living in the moment and awakening to experience.” Psychology Today

Are we a Spiritual Community?

We believe building and living in community are in fact spiritual practices. We’re not affiliated with any specific religion, and most of us don’t consider ourselves to be “religious.”   However, we do embrace various contemplative practices found in all religions, and many of us rely heavily on various Buddhist traditions, though we believe most of our mindfuless practices are common to all wisdom traditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/community-for-mindful-living-cohousing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/community-for-mindful-living-cohousing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We're committed to cultivating a practice of family-friendly mindful living within a modern cohousing community.  Residents own their living spaces and a shared interest in a large common house, gardens, and other communal spaces.

We consider living in a supportive community a valuable opportunity for both personal and societal transformation.  The benefits for our children, ourselves, our neighbors, and our planet are innumerable.

We are involved in three active initiatives.

1. Bolinas/Stinson Beach, CA  Project.  This is our BIG NEWS.  We are in very early stages, but seriously looking at creating an intentional community on agricultural land in this beautiful seaside community, 50 minutes from San Francisco.  If you have in interest in joining us, please let us know.

2. Berkeley, CA Project.  In 2011, we converted a well located 4 unit Berkeley, CA property into a small cohousing community with 8 adults and 5 children.  Currently, there are no openings, though we eventually hope to acquire the two adjacent properties, ultimately growing to 10-12 units.  Contact us to be alerted when openings become available.

3. Madrid Project.  We have a small 5 unit cohousing prototype project up and running in Madrid, Spain with a high level or intentional living and mindfulness practices at our core.  It is full at the moment but we regularly welcome guests from all over the world.

We Are United By:

1) A Shared Insight that all things are interconnected.  We inter-are.

 2) A Shared Practice of mindfulness and living in the present moment as a way of cultivating insight and wisdom.

The community’s success is measured by its effectiveness in supporting the growth and happiness of those it influences.

We Embrace Two Primary Values

1) Communitarian – Living in harmony with others.  We share the strong intention to live more collaboratively and closely with others in order to better understand ourselves and the world we live in.  We see living in true community among supportive friends as an opportunity for, both personal and societal transformation.

2) Educational – Spreading knowledge and inspiring others.  We find purpose in what we do by educating and empowering others beyond our core community.  We endeavor to model an attractive, healthy, joyful, sustainable way of living in a compassionate, cooperative and less consumptive manner.

Other Values Follow

1) Simplicity – Living simple lives in the present moment. We are living in fast-paced, distracting, chaotic times.  It is increasingly easy, and hazardous, to lose our bearings in the modern world.  We aspire to live simply, and slowly, in a supportive community that helps us stay focused on what matters most.

2) Ecological – Living in harmony with nature.  We strive to live more sustainably by embracing permaculture principles.  We pursue renewable energy, green building methods, the reduction of waste, compassionate consumption, and other methods of treading lightly on our planet.

3) Inclusion – We value and embrace inclusion.  We are non-sectarian and deeply respect the many different cultural and lifestyle traditions.  Our common thread is our commitment to cultivating an awareness of the divine in all things.  We are open to everyone who shares this respect and see strength in diversity.  

Characteristics of our Community Include

1) Participatory process. Residents participate in the design and management of the community, help prepare common meals, and together solve problems and develop policies for the community.

2) Common facilities. Common facilities and open spaces are designed for optional daily use, are an integral part of the community, and are supplemental to the individual residences.

3) Non-hierarchical structure and decision-making.  No one person (or persons) has authority over others, though we value expertise and seniority.  As people join the group, each person takes on one or more roles consistent with his or her skills, abilities or interests. We use a form of modified consensus for all decision-making.

4) No shared community economy.  Currently, the community is not a source of income for its members and typically work done by anyone will be considered that member’s contribution to the shared responsibilities.</description>

      <name>Familia Feliz (GER1)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22745&quot;&gt;Familia Feliz (GER1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; One main mission is to create a contemporary version of community structure, which implies sustainability, international exchange (we speak Spanish, English, German, French) and socio-cultural projects. The focus also is on establishing ways of self-supply (bio garden, chicken, fruit farming).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/familia-feliz-ger1/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/familia-feliz-ger1/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Familia Feliz is a decentralized living community with shared economy. Decentralized means those people live together who want to do so. The community does not dictate where a member should live or that all members have to live in one place at all times. Instead, it is part of the concept of Familia Feliz to live in different countries and different places. We start in Spain and Germany as these are the countries we already live and call our homes. Our community life is based on a shared economy, decisions by consensus, veto for each and solidarity with each member.  We respect and develop private property and focus on life in peace and freedom.

Familia Feliz is organized in units. A unit can be a working unit like &quot;bio garden&quot; or a company run by members, as well as a a home unit, a group of members living in one house.</description>

      <name>Casa Colibri Catholic Worker A.C.</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22746&quot;&gt;Casa Colibri Catholic Worker A.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are a community that advances the integral development of the families of Hostotipaquillo, Jal, who are in vulnerable situations, by accompanying them in processes to improve their conditions of life by means of their active participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/casa-colibri-catholic-worker-a-c/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/casa-colibri-catholic-worker-a-c/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Casa Colibri is part of the Catholic Worker movement started by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin. If you are unfamiliar with it, check out the national website to become familiar with the philosophy: 

www.catholicworker.org/communities/directory.html

At Casa Colibri there are five areas that enrich the community experience:

Children:
Monday, Wednesday and Friday we have 40 kids, ranging from 4-17 years old. First there is an hour of class, and then we serve them a homemade meal. These days the work consists of preparing and cooking the food, teaching or playing with the kids, serving the food, and cleaning the house. 

Sustainability:
Tuesdays and Thursdays consist of a variety of activities around the house, especially working in the garden where we have chickens, compost worms, medicinal herbs, and vegetables. Extra activities include the soap project in which the kids learn how to make soaps from herbs grown in our garden. 

Community Life:
This is a big part of living at Casa Colibri. The house also has many other activities that we do within the community, such as group check-ins, meditations, and excursions to the pueblo and surrounding areas. Every Friday we have a “happy hour” in which we do something fun as a community. 

Community development:
We also work with the community of Hostotipaquillo by giving extra classes and workshops (depending on the number of volunteers and their skills) involving the families of the children as well. We also work to create a culture of art and creativity in the house and with the greater community of Hostotipaquillo.

Spirituality:
This includes a monthly Mass, when friends and the families come to the house to gather, as well as weekly group meditations and discussions. The house is open to people of all spiritualities. 

The day starts with breakfast at 7:30 am, and on average we work about 6-7 hours, including the mid-day meal. The evening time, after 5:00 pm is personal time. Saturday and Sundays are free, with the exception of the monthly community Mass or special events.

Previous experience working with children, farming, and/or living in community is a plus. However these skills are not required, as long as you are open to learning, experiencing new things, and being challenged. Knowledge of basic Spanish is required.

The house asks that you make a minimum 6-month commitment.

In exchange for working with an open and generous heart, one will receive room and board. Extra personal expenses should be covered by the community member.
In addition to community members we also have national and international short term volunteers.

If you have further questions don´t hesitate to contact us.</description>

      <name>Uruguay World Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22748&quot;&gt;Uruguay World Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our hope is to build a world community of people looking to settle somewhere beautiful, safe, and easy to emigrate to. We are flexible and open to all kinds of arrangements. As of right now, we would only lease the land to people we have come to know and trust. If you are interested in emigrating to Uruguay, get in touch with us and come and meet us. If we build a relationship and mutually agree that sharing the land would be a good option, we can then talk about legal options for living on the land. However, we expect this relationship-building stage to take some time, so do not expect to meet us online and immediately come move to the land. Alternatively, we would love for people to settle nearby to us on their own land, so we can share resources and build a community together. We are a family with young children, but would love to develop a community that represents all ages.

We imagine a little village. One where we have our own individual homes and lifestyles, but can live in community with one another. Get in touch if you share this dream!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/uruguay-world-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/uruguay-world-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a family originally from Chicago that has chosen Uruguay as the place we will settle and raise our kids. Patrick (b. 1985) and Ashley (b. 1985) and Isabel (b. 2013) have 9 acres in the beautiful Uruguayan countryside in between Nueva Helvecia and Playa Fomento. Our land is 2 hours (by bus and ferry) to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and 1.5 hours (by bus) to Montevideo, Uruguay. Our land is fertile, our water clean, and we are looking for people with whom we can share our abundance! Whether that means to share in living on the land, in agricultural production, sharing tools or animals, sharing in schooling children, or coming together to share knowledge and have fun, we would love others to come to come live nearby!</description>

But my husband and I are serious about wanting to live in community on the outskirts of Bend, Oregon. 

We have a young daughter and are primarily  looking for a few other small families to join us in living simply, sharing a lot of space, life and labor. Beyond that we would also love to have a variety of ages involved.

Our ideal setup is small personal spaces and a large common house for most of our needs beyond privacy- cooking, playing, creating...this allows for comfortably working together on life chores and allows more time and resources for extracurriculars. Also, there can be frequent human connection and assistance without the scheduling and driving that modern life entails.

Join us! Let's build a community!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22777&quot;&gt;TaraEden EcoVillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To create a community that works for all, while protecting and prospering our planet, being a shining example for the world to teach/ duplicate this sustainable lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/taraeden-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/taraeden-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hello, everyone!! 
So happy to finally get a public posting of our dream community!
First off, let me introduce myself, I AM Niki Lane, Director and Visionary behind this huge endeavor.
Yes, I believe I have lost my mind while at the same time being more sane than i have ever been!  LOL. In the words of MLK, I HAVE A DREAM! And I intend with everything i am to get this ball rolling; someway, somehow it WILL happen!  We are in what I would call the zygote state; we are not even in the embryonic state yet! In fact, It is kinda like the morning after conception! 
So if you are looking for a place that is up and running, a &quot;turn key&quot; step into perfection kind of situation well this is not it, keep moving. This is dirty, messy and so ground floor as to be almost subterranean! 
 We are seeking the most intrepid, energetic and gregarious type of individuals to come be founding pioneer FAMILY members. We need souls that desire to have an intricately involved commitment to a project, who have visions of a more perfect world and who desire with a fire in their bellies to be a strong contributing factor in the creation of something truly GREAT and wholly INSPIRING, with the tenacity to see it thru to the end! (Plus any and all who want to come for a bit and share in the excitement and add their energetic footprint to a worthy cause!)
If you are like me you have seen the dismal state that our beautiful mother Gaia has found herself in because of mankind's greed, unawareness and shortsightedness, and you see that if WE as a species ever want to manage to survive on this AMAZING planet, you see that MAJOR CHANGES MUST occur,,, and SOON!
Now also you must realise that IF we are to ever get the majority of humans on board with the eco-balanced, sustainable and soul-fulfilling lifestyle that will facilitate the continuing survival of our species then you know that we are going to HAVE to take the eco lifestyle to a higher, more sexy and ATTRACTIVE level. This means moving it to a place that the MAINSTREAM population can view it as a truly VIABLE, ACCEPTABLE and DESIRABLE way of life. 
We simply must move our sustainability from the hippy, wonky, and primitive poop-in-a-bucket far left to a more moderate , clean and orderly way of things.
 Think about it, how can we shift all the great things being done in this emerging field into a cohesive, technically advanced, unifying, cyclical, waste-free, planet-protecting, soul-soaringly fulfilling, self-balancing, UNSTOPPABLE revolution? Well, SOMEONE has got to PUT IT all TOGETHER into a VISION that gives life to that possibility!!

So to that end we have a CONCEPTUAL VISION description that paints a picture of what we are ultimately aiming for. This is a living document that grows and changes as we do. AGAIN, this is THE VISION, written in the present tense as if it already exists and is intended to SPEAK it into BEING!
 (Please be aware that this IS NOT what we have at the moment, it is what we are seeking to grow into! )
If after reading it you desire to grow WITH US, then PLEASE contact us for further exploration of your involvement!

                            CONCEPTUAL VISION

                          What We Intend To Create

A walkabout will remind you of why this place is named “TaraEden”, Tara= earth and Eden=paradise. 
Town center is referred to as the “Heart” of town and is literally a heart-shaped promenade with plenty of space for the weekly farmers markets, events and community gatherings. A place to go for an evening stroll; you can stop in for a frozen yogurt or cup of tea with friends. This is where the music happens, besides the scheduled talent who are invited to play here, you never know when an impromptu jam session, solo guitarist, flutist or breakout karaoke might erupt for your listening or participation pleasure.
 The certified Community Kitchen, Culinary school, Dining and lecture halls are all located here in the Heart of town, surrounded by an old-world-style market place with products and services that warm the heart and feed the soul because the vendors are all family.

Like our symbiotic and cyclical Bio gas/ Alcohol fuel production and waste management systems utilizing Fodder Beets and Cat tails for the onsite treatment facility that provides clean renewable energy.  Plus our solar, wind, Mini Hydro and geothermal power sourcings are leading the way to not only impact-free utilities but to actual carbon-negative results.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22781&quot;&gt;Hidden Meadow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To create a small community that will be a wonderful place to live now and play a strong positive role in a transition to genuine sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/hidden-meadow/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/hidden-meadow/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We currently own the property in question and are looking to live there with people who share our commitment to creating a genuinely sustainable society. The building site is on a rocky slope that overlooks a small, sheltered meadow. This housing effort is part of a larger initiative to sustainably develop a 185-acre parcel in St. Albans, VT, on the Georgia town line. Vermont Organics Reclamation is currently operating on the site (see www.vermontorganics.org), and we are looking to undertake approximately a dozen other projects ranging from an agroforestry project that seeks to reproduce what may have been done here by native Americans to a green business center elsewhere on the parcel.

By definition, unsustainable activities cannot continue indefinitely: sustainability is inevitable. What is not inevitable is the comfortable lifestyles to which we have become accustomed. We want to make significant contributions to a good transition to a genuinely sustainable and prosperous society and hope to find others willing to make positive contributions to some part(s) of this effort.</description>

      <name>Grace: Sanctuary For The Conscious Mind</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22783&quot;&gt;Grace: Sanctuary For The Conscious Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to create a regenerative sanctuary for the conscious mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/grateful-4-grace/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/grateful-4-grace/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are at the beginning of this journey. Formerly a co-housing space held for music events. We are currently in the process of transitioning to a more diversified sanctuary that benefits our new members and the community around it.

Our vision is to utilize the property to create community through the establishment of it's own ethical food source, music, art, and various other modes of healing the mind, body &amp;amp; soul.

We plan to incorporate permaculture techniques both in the physical and social sense. We plan to have compost toilets and outdoor kitchens. We envision buses, rv's, tiny houses, and tents to occupy our land. We will turn sand into luscious black gold. We will collect the water from the sky and use it to bathe and wash our dishes. We will create a maker's space for maker's of all types.

We plan on further developing our entrepreneur-like dreams on the property which will take many forms such as a farm-to-table kitchen, recording studio for musicians, &amp;amp; bicycle mechanic shop.  Creating an income doing what we we love to do within the comfort of our own sanctuary.

We would like to host you. At this time we can only take people that we feel bring balance to our current timeline. This being said, we are actively seeking builders, carpenters,  resource accumulators, grant-writers, healers, musicians, artists, permaculturists, arborists, labors, raw vegan/vegan chefs, homesteaders, upcyclers, minimalists, non-profit business managers, yoga instructors, flow artists,  well installers, natural pool builders, &amp;amp; people with earth skills we havent mentioned that you think may apply.

Typical stays are for 4 days unless an agreement is reached for special situations which may require more time.
we currently are working on building our first garden and wil not have enough food for visitors so we ask that you are able to take care of yourself for the most part. We appreciate a non-gmo environment. We try to live as harmoniously with the environment as possible so earth-friendly products are appreciated.</description>

Seeking to Join or to Build a community supporting homesteading &amp;amp; wildlife, with open and wooded land, potential for livestock and a vegetable farm, growing veggies and fruits for our line of Nama's Farmhouse Preserves.  We have been working with heirloom vegetables, and interested in seed saving and a small regional seed company of resilient varieties for a changing climate.

We envision a healing bodywork practice there or nearby, and space for creative and expressive arts experiences.  A land-based, TransitionTown-minded community life is our goal, and we are ready to open dialogue with people interested in building together. 

We would like to build our own home with super-local and sustainable materials.
We have been raising vegetables, preserving foods, keeping a small flock of chickens, and selling our wares at farmers' markets since 2010.  We have moved our farm three times in eight years of growing in Vermont.  We have found we can grow food almost anywhere, but it's the people to live in community with that matter most.


Nate is a professional massage therapist/healer, veggie grower, performer, and writer. 
Ama is a chef/ culinary creatrix, veggie grower, textile artist, graphic designer, and poet.

Some values &amp;amp; goals of ours:
Human Values and Ecological Values held in balance:
Spiritual Connection &amp;amp; Relationship with Earth, a peaceful Home where All Beings are Respected
Honesty, Love, Thoughtfulness, Intelligence, Artistic Expression and Appreciation.
Diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, skills and talents.
Knowledge of Nature's Wisdom &amp;amp; Science.
Skills in caring for each other &amp;amp; children, the land, plants, animals, mutual property &amp;amp; ones own emotional/matters. 
Valuing one's own healing, humility, gratitude, self-knowledge, and spiritual development.

We love Vermont, and feel this is an excellent place to stay and grow.  The kindness and community resiliency following Hurricane Irene in 2011 was marvelous! We have made many friends here. However, it has been difficult to overcome the constant suction of &quot;the machine&quot;/digital communications and distractions of modern life.  Most people seem too busy to take time to regularly connect.  We would like to be present with and responsive to the natural world including our human connections.

It feels clear the time is now to form or join a community.  We believe that we can fulfill our personal need for connection and work purpose by living with shared goals and private life, based in the attuned working of soil and forest for food and fuel &amp;amp; building together, learning sustainable skills, making amazing meals, music, and art.  
Together we can be happier, heal our souls, and heal the earth we steward.

One Love,
Nate &amp;amp; Ama

    Integrating spiritual growth with work that gets results
    Putting our study and practice into action
    Serving the Dharma and supporting Buddhist practitioners
    Working for the benefit of all beings

This way of studying and practicing the Dharma is a challenging and rewarding adventure. We have accomplished huge amounts for such a small community. We continue to learn new skills and deepen our understanding of the teachings, and we see every day as an opportunity for growth and accomplishment.

Day by day, we are building a model for how a Buddhist community can flourish in the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-nyingma-mandala-training-program/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-nyingma-mandala-training-program/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Tarthang Tulku came to this country because he saw America as a land of opportunity, where he could work to preserve and transmit the teachings that his teachers had passed on to him. He emphasized getting tangible results, with a special focus on preserving sacred texts and creating communities built around Buddhist principles.

Today, his older students are working to pass that vision on to others. Our aim is to create an enduring legacy and a home for the Dharma in the West.

The Mandala Training Program is for individuals inspired by that vision and ready to give their energy to making it happen. When you make that commitment, a dynamic path to inner growth and transformation opens before you.

The Mandala Training Program is a 6-month, residential work-study program that introduces students to our approach to the study and practice of Buddhism and participate in the community’s way of life. Students live and work in our downtown Berkeley Nyingma residential community. We dedicate our efforts full-time toward serving the Dharma and deepening our own understanding.</description>

We tend to be into health, outdoors, permaculture , environmental awareness, music, yoga, meditation, NVC, counseling, qi gong, hiking, etc. But mostly, we just want good people who want to be in casual community and who are willing to work through challenges when they do arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/woodacre-co-housing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/woodacre-co-housing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a newly forming, kid-friendly community, inspired by permaculture and co-housing paradigms. We started with two adjacent properties in a sunny part of Woodacre; the total land is about 2/3 of an acre. We've been knocking down the fence between the properties and planting gardens. It's already gorgeous and it's just getting better over time! There will be 4 households by May 1 (available now). So far there are 5 of us - we are one adult couple and two single adults happily co-parenting our 7-year-old girl.

We started out as neighbors and we're becoming like family. It's a small but revolutionary model ... and if you resonate, we'd love to hear from you! Let us know something about yourself and what you're looking for, and how best to reach you.</description>

We imagine a future where people work cooperatively to support individual thrivelihoods while stewarding the land and community culture simultaneously building a resilient and diverse ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/possibilitarian-regenerative-community-homestead-porch/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/possibilitarian-regenerative-community-homestead-porch/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;PORCH stands for Possibilitarian Regenerative Community Homestead. In basic terms, PORCH is a house with 2 kitchens, 2 bathrooms, five bedrooms, 2 shared living/dining room gathering spaces, 2 porches and a large community permaculture garden attached.  PORCH is a 5 years developing, and currently newly burgeoning, opportunity to live in a structured community environment, where collective work and engagement with the community are included in the housing agreement. There are currently 2 residents in the house, and 2 official non-resident collaborators.  We are looking for 3 new people to live in the house  starting as soon as May 2016.   Applicants should be interested in engaging with community, as well as working to maintain and improve upon an intentional community homestead model.

We are all about exploring what's possible through a community of shared values of people care, earth care and fair share... which translates to the values of communication, accountability and respect, creativity, open community, collective labor and collaboration, direct democracy, social and political consciousness, resilience and diversity, safer space, playfulness, inclusion, and place-based activism.

I’m looking to create a space that caters to alternative sexuality/lovestyle/lifestyle intersectional leftist/liberal/progressive/radical social-justice-caring-about types, especially kinky people/kinksters. Geeks of any &amp; all stripes preferred. In short, I’m trying to build a chosen family, of a sort, to live in a home together. I want it to be a place where people can be their whole selves at home &amp; be accepted. We will do our best to accommodate everyone’s disabilities, physical, mental, developmental, etc., so that everyone can live in a nice happy home. A place where you feel loved for who you are, regardless of what that may entail. A place you feel comfortable enough to live your life to the fullest &amp; where the environment enables you to do so.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22810&quot;&gt;Autumn Sun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Above all, Autumn Sun seeks to “Build Trust with Each Other.” Our goal and vision is to become an intentional, extended family, that is able to care for each other in perpetuity. Among others, we plan to develop and implement social and legal structures for continuing care of our land, facilities and community members for 100+ years. Further, we seek to develop a model that enables us to counsel others who have land to share on the successful concepts, methods, and tools we find most helpful in our ongoing efforts to provide sustainable solutions for affordable living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/autumn-sun/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/autumn-sun/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Based on a 6-acre rural property outside the historic town of Ashland Virginia, the Autumn Sun Community is developing a master plan for an intentional inter-generational community, based around permaculture principles, community gardening, and practical green-building practices for constructing small, sustainable homes.

The community property includes a single-family home, a large shared house, a log cabin studio, small business office, and 6,000-foot warehouse, all run on 90% renewable energy. Our master plan for the property includes the development of a 5,000-square-foot home for co-housing and shared caregiving, as well as a large greenhouse. We are tiny house friendly, and welcome occasional campers.

We are an open and accepting community of individuals who enjoy art, music, exercise, and outdoor living. The community kitchen, garden, workshop, and outdoor fire ring are frequent gathering places that are open to all, and enjoyably used for fun and free-flowing conversation. Community members show respect for each other’s privacy, and spaces abound for quiet contemplation and personal reflection.

Ours is a new community with a varied mix of employment. Individual and household income is managed by each family, with revenue-sharing potential for community projects. Community decision-making is made through processes best described as Sociocratic and Modified Consensus. Currently, “work trade” is an option in exchange for all or a portion of community members’ contribution for their portion of the shared living space. 

The Autumn Sun Community is filled with entrepreneurial-minded members. We encourage knowledge-sharing and group instruction. Community member revenue may be made through participation in collaborative workshops and shared community projects, as well as the individual use of the large workshop with shared workspace and tools. The same will hold for shared use of the large greenhouse once construction is complete. 

If you would like to visit Autumn Sun, please contact the original property owner, Ken Schaal, at 804-798-5371, or send an email to CWSolar1@Gmail.com or visit us at: AutumnSunLane.com.</description>

You and me, we're gonna live freestyle,
At least for a while, till the day that we die,
I know we shall find a place under the sky
Where Love is the law and the truth cannot lie,
Who you've been where you going
Have you coming from far?
It don't matter for us, in the present we trust.
We know the worst criminal is a diamond covered in dust

So welcome back to your long-lost home,
You traveled from far but now you know 
you are not alone
We are millions, billions
Praying for change
One day we shall unite, gather under this name

Badulina
Open up your gates
Open up your mind
Open up your heart

[Badulina that's also title of the CD, book and beautiful song made by mystical music group.
When new people arrive I introduce them with this song text.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/badulina/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/badulina/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Welcome to Badulina, a young intentional community in South Spain. We enjoy living together with heart, mind and hands. We are from all ages and hold this land for our children and their children to grow up in abundance and harmony. We like to be healthy and open-minded and we aim for self sustainability while also enjoying the advantages of modern technology. Badulina is organized as an association. Joining members become co-owners of the project. Where we invite you to choose an area to build a home and realize your part of the Badulina dream.

We are living on easy slope of blooming terraces with fields of flowers on the fertile ground, taking a deep breath, cracking almonds, picking oranges, peaches, figs, apples and grapes already growing on the property, tasting the wealth of Mother Nature. Creating comfortable living spaces in the cooling shadow of the olive grove in a colorful mixture of creative buildings, people living and working together and hearing the laughter of our children. 

In average we are in-between 10 and 15 adults + children. We are currently 2 families with children, elders, visitors and volunteers. In the years the final goal is to reach about 25 members that have their own homes and private areas on the land. Our group is an international mixture of Dutch, Belgium, German, English and Polish people. Our common language is English.

Badulina is organized as an association that governs the whole land. Joining members need to contribute financially to become co-owners of the project. Where we invite you to choose an area to build a home and realize your part of the Badulina dream.

The place is about 9 hectares big, a whole hill with two river beds as natural barriers. We have about 2 hectares with 270 olive trees, 500 almond trees that need to be maintained and harvested and have 200 grape vines. Further a lot of herb land and over 100 fruit trees like: fig-, orange-, mandarin-, lemon-, apple-, pear-, walnut-trees, etc. We have chickens, bee hives and 3 cats.

On the land there is currently nice house in good state with electricity, water, internet, solar water heater and other basic luxuries. It is our temporary communal kitchen, community office and tool shed. Outside we have an extra kitchen, big dining table, sofas, etc. We have also a 6m communal yurt as our communal space. We also have some nice private yurts and domes spread around.

Still we are like settlers on this new land. Right now there are the communal facilities, some caravans, olive tree terraces and a nice atmosphere in nature but we need to improvise till we create facilities for the private places. We will not have fixed buildings for everyone yet. You need to build or arrange your own home on the land in time.

We are planning a big communal building, dance floor, swimming pool, water reservoir and solar system to become as community self sufficient. On the chosen private areas members can build their homes (first temporary ones that do not require building permissions), get water, electricity and internet to it and make their spaces beautiful.

We are at 500m above sea level and you can walk to the near town Orgiva. The climate is mild, it does not snow in winter, but there can be some frost in some mornings. There is almost no rain in summer and can be over 40 degrees in the midday hours.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22829&quot;&gt;Purani Valley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is for each community member to become an individual with abilities and characteristics diverse from others, yet to express himself/herself in unity and partnership with others. We believe this to be our soul's mission on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/purani-valley/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/purani-valley/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Purani Valley is a community that began forming in the beautiful Matutu Valley in Minas Gerais, Brazil. It began to take root by a shared vision of creating a community where people can develop their own gifts from a base of love, creative expression, art, music, poetry, and self-development. 

With much attention to detail, the construction began over 15 years ago to create structures with recycled materials, beautiful gardens, and an overall atmosphere of serene practicality. The environment is such that one can cultivate his/her gifts and receive healing through yoga, massage, gestalt, ayurvedic, culinary arts, baking, candlemaking, papermaking, beekeeping, farming, herbalism, and aromatherapy.

Multidisciplinary healing programs are created to revive the body, engage the mind and uplift the spirit. The environment is designed to accommodate groups for workshops and to promote authentic and true connection to each individual through music, dance, poetry, yoga, philosophy and education.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22831&quot;&gt;The Nest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Some of us are here to deepen our relationship with the earth.  Some are looking to foster community rooted in love and interdependence.  And some of us are just happy to have some good people to live and share a home with.  Some things that members would consider a big part of their lives: rewilding, foraging, permaculture, music, anarchy, love, sharing, community, activism, herbal medicine, education, human ecology, alternative economics, celebration, food, and compost.  Some of us identify as queer and we're all queer friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-nest/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-nest/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We're a house of friends and beyond.  It's a house that was falling apart and a few of us bought together to take some solid steps towards living our dreams.  We've fixed most of it up and now we're a house of 6.  There's a tiny jungle of a yard, full of beautiful flowers and wildness.  Our incredibly cool neighbors have some land that they've offered us to grow food on in exchange for some of the bounty, so some of us do that.  

Our dreams as individuals are big and intertwine all over.  While we share this somewhat typical house nestled within the grip of civilization, most of us plan on a future of living with the land in the near or distant horizon.  We're not sure what this house means to the bigger picture but we're pretty sure it's important.

And so our community is &quot;Established&quot; in the sense that here we are, sharing this space together, but still &quot;Forming&quot; in that we don't totally know what the future holds for us.</description>

We have a sister church in Kampala, Uganda, which is engaged in similar work.

God is calling serious disciples from around the world to greater trust and greater fidelity to his Kingdom; we are privileged to be on the forefront of this movement.</description>

      <name>Odiyan Retreat Center</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22840&quot;&gt;Odiyan Retreat Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The mission of the Odiyan Retreat Center is twofold: 1) To assist in the protection, preservation and flourishing of all Buddhist cultures in Asia; and 2) To model as a living experiment the integration of Buddhist principles and Western thought through a live/work lifestyle dedicated to the benefit of our planet and all humanity.

The focus is on using work as an effective spiritual exercise, a practice in mindfulness and the means of perfecting six spiritual qualities, from generosity to discipline and patience, foundation of vigor, concentration, and wisdom. This basic training is called Skillful Means and is based on a book of the same name written by Odiyan founder Tarthang Tulku Rinpoche.  Rinpoche introduced Skillful Means as a way to help readers find greater satisfaction in work and life.

Classes and study opportunities available for all residents in Tibetan yoga, Skilfull Means, classical Tibetan language and other aspects of spiritual community life. 

Resident volunteers who stay on beyond six months also have optional opportunities for engaging in community activities such as daily early morning meditation and other practices of the Buddhist tradition. 

Skillful Means points out how the discipline of work develops awareness, strengthens concentration, and stimulates energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/odiyan-retreat-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/odiyan-retreat-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Odiyan is an all-volunteer non-profit Retreat Center dedicated to meaningful work, wholesome living and the inner development of mind and spirit.

The Odiyan way of life integrates creative and challenging work with a path of self-exploration that opens up your inner potential.  Odiyan’s dual mission is preserving the Buddhist cultures of Asia and modeling a living experiment integrating Buddhist principles and Western thought for the benefit of our planet and all of humanity.

Odiyan was founded in 1975 by Tibetan Buddhist Lama Tarthang Tulku. For over 40 years, volunteers from all over the world have been coming to Odiyan for six months or more to develop their own potential and contribute to the unique and holistic vision of enlightened knowledge for the benefit of all.

Odiyan Retreat Center sits on 1,000 acres overlooking the Pacific Ocean in northern California about 100 miles north of San Francisco. About 150 acres are managed landscape including seven orchards, four vegetable gardens, ornamental gardens surrounding the Temples, ponds, forests and open land.

As a resident at Odiyan, you will learn new skills, engage your mind and replenish your spirit in a wholesome, beautiful environment where accomplishment and learning about yourself go hand-in-hand. 

Living and working at Odiyan includes classes about Buddhism, a wide variety of work and sacred arts, vegetarian meals and a living allowance ($150 per month).

The minimum commitment to volunteer is six months.</description>

To become part of something greater than ourselves, and enjoy all the benefits that come with these new freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-hive-mind/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-hive-mind/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Hive Mind will be community based on my unconventional belief system. We will see ourselves as a singular entity separate from, yet encapsulated within society unfairly. We will live functionally using the organizational structure of our member-designed rituals and laws. We are not Capitalists, not Communists, not Socialists ... we are an independent form of Separatism. I coined the term &quot;Pagan Separatism,&quot; because the word Pagan really just means unconventional religion. As founder I am a Guru of the this undertaking. Our home will be the Hive and &quot;we&quot; are the Mind. I ask for a strong commitment to the teachings and the lifestyle.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22853&quot;&gt;Country Gardens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; ““We are a rural eco-village community, cultivating supportive relationships with each other, the larger community, and the Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/country-gardens/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/country-gardens/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are at the early stages of forming.  We are seeking like-minded, respectful, community-oriented, organically oriented gardening, permaculture, self-sufficiency, peace-loving co-founders to join with us in designing and establishing the village. 

We envision creating a rural eco-village community, cultivating supportive relationships with each other, the larger surrounding community, and the Earth.

We have strong Environmentalist Values—potential new members must be comfortable with the expectation that this is an environmentalist community.  Prefer members to be of a permaculture and organic mindset; for both gardening and farming animals.

Location
Our 95-acres of land are located in north central Oklahoma, which is in the center of the U.S. and part of the “Great Plains.” Our 95 acres is heavily forested in places and has some open pasture and farmland as well. We are 3 miles from a small town population 1,100, and about 50 miles west of Tulsa, OK. 

We already have a great deal that we do on our land, practices we have followed, and projects completed and in the works.  We are open to the community validating or changing these as the group determines:
1. Permaculture principles such as Hugelkultur, deep mulching, terracing with swales and berms; and rainwater capture
2. Energy independence using solar, wind, water capture, and earthship greenhouse
3. Peace-loving, open-minded lifestyle
4. Organically certified gardening
5. Ranching, dairy goats for milk, cheese, yogurt and Kefir production
6. Poultry for eggs and meat production, as well as for pest reduction;
7. Wildcrafting/Foraging for greens, mushrooms, fruit, herbs, soapberries, etc.
8. Agricultural land use for potential produce sales income through the Oklahoma Food Cooperative (www.oklahomafood.coop) and/or a nearby Farmer’s Market.
9. Hunting in an excellent white-tailed deer habitat with limited bow-hunting for shared meat acquisition
10. Cob-Straw-bale building (in process) for multi-purpose community use, such as for meetings, a loft for WWOOFers, group music making and drumming, and health food store inventory and retail sales.
11. Cob-Rocket Oven and Shelter (in process) for outdoor community cooking use
12. Greenhouse (Earthship design, under construction) for seed-starting and winter greens production.

Some of our core values, principles we would like to ascribe to, are listed below.

1. A Multi-generational approach to living and sharing labor and knowledge
2. Peace-loving attitudes with open-mindedness as a fundamental value
3. Tool and equipment sharing, for community projects
4. Egalitarian, Income-Sharing optional on communal farm enterprises (such as health food business, farm store, or organic produce sales)
5. Energy and self-sufficient lifestyle, (within reason--not from a paranoid viewpoint)
6. Communally engaged (while still respecting everyone's right to privacy)
7. Environmentally focused (respect and care for surrounding environment and the Earth as a whole)

What we prefer to avoid:
•Gun use other than for food acquisition
•Extremist viewpoints
•Using large farm equipment

When contacting us please include:
•What about Country Gardens interests you and what are your intentions for being here?
•What does living in an eco-community mean to you?
•What assets will you bring to the community?
•What is your background so far?
•What is your full legal name, address, birthday, and government form of identification?
•If anything stated above concerns you, but you are still interested in being a part of our community, please let us know what your concern is and we can speak further with you in that regard.

7.  We steward and nurture the land on which we live, its natural and human communities, its productive farm, and its role in the ecosystem around it.
8.  We balance the stewardship of our land with areas for food production, human habitation and recreation, and restoration of the native ecosystem.
9.  We steward personal and community energy and resources responsibly with moderation, innovation, and sharing.
10.  We engage in ecologically and socially sustainable practices to meet our needs.
11.  We actively engage and participate with the surrounding neighborhood, city, and region, in education and work that nurtures and sustains our common society and environment.
12.  We value diversity and invite all who share our vision to explore participation and/or membership in our village.
13.  We strive to continually learn and grow in ways that support our vision and values.</description>

We have 3 greenhouses, a fruit and vegetable growing field, goats, ducks, chickens, a shop, a few dwellings, fruit trees, and a farm stand.  We also already have a few cats and dogs and will not be accepting any more. We are very open-minded and would love to have people passionate about permaculture and more natural ways of living. In the past we had a lot of fun but got sidetracked when venturing into beer- and wine-making and problems ensued, so lesson learned, we are working to get back on track to our original vision and will not be accepting people with any drug or alcohol problems. We still plan on having fun but hopefully with music, food, and dance minus the drunken shenanigans. At the moment the property is not very child-friendly, but with the right kind of folks and property cleanup, that will hopefully change.  We have lots of stuff for the creative person to mess around with. This year we would like to work on soil remediation and nut trees and redesigning our planting field in line with permaculture principles. Next year we would like to be able to have enough produce to sell at the local farmers market. We are not certified organic nor do we intend to be, but we do practice organic methods.</description>

Right now we are traveling across the US, looking at some communities we are interested in joining. Below is our vision for the ideal community. We still welcome email inquiries from folks who resonate with our vision!****

Our goal is to build or join an intentional community of families working towards ecological and social sustainability. The clear place to start is through finding like-minded, like-hearted individuals with whom we can embark on this journey.

I hope that in sharing my vision, our family will either find an established community of families interested in our joining as potential members, or that we’ll find a group of families interested in embarking on the journey of creating an intentional community together.

ABOUT US:

We are a family of five humans. Joey is in his mid-thirties and I am in my mid-twenties. We have three children together – Peacy is 5, born in March 2011. Micah is 3, born in December 2012, and Ahmik is 6 months old, born last January. We currently live in northern New Mexico on a small and anything-but-sustainable homestead. We tend goats, chickens, rabbits, honeybees and a garden. We have a dog who lives with us, and three cats who live in our outbuildings, keeping the mice at bay. We have lived in a number of other places over the past few years as well – New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut … and some other temporary spots along the way. 

I am a natural childbirth (freebirth) advocate, a gardener, herbalist, baker… I love to work with my hands – to create beautiful things. I built a cob oven last summer, and it has taken a huge place in my heart – stoking the fire, kneading the bread, forming the loaves and letting them rise … and baking, and then finally eating them and feeling all that love made tangible. I have a newfound love for sourdough. I have a strong desire to become a master grower of brambles … to learn how to cultivate the BEST black raspberries ever … because what could be better than raspberries?? I am also incredibly in love with waterfalls, thunderstorms … stones, mountains, willows … moss, ferns, motherwort, yarrow, mint, roses … . I am learning how to be the best mother I can be – to be mindful and deliberate in my relationship with my children. This is my greatest challenge, but the process is so rewarding when I commit myself to it fully, and looking back, I can see in the last five years how I have made enormous progress in my ability to be a gentle, compassionate parent.

Peacy is in love with flowers. She has big questions for a five-year-old, like “where does water come from?” “How are rocks made?” “Do crabs breathe air or water?” Sometimes I know how to answer her questions but usually we just contemplate them together… . She gets me thinking and I really love getting deep into things with her. She is very guarded around people she does not know, too. Micah is a very gentle soul … very internal, but really fun to be with. He likes to watch little creatures, like beetles and ants and bees, and to talk about them. He loves to share his joy. He also has a mischievous streak, and he loves the moon. Ahmik is so sweet, so open and bright and excited to be with others. She has an amazing smile, and a beautiful laugh. I can’t wait to see what she will be like when she is older. 

LAND:

I know that the land I choose to inhabit will ultimately shape my life to a greater extent than any other factor. So in that respect, there are a few aspects which I consider essential in determining where to live. 

Firstly, nearby access to clean freshwater is essential. That could take the form of lakes, ponds, rivers, or year-round streams. (Ideally, they would be strong and consistent enough to support human use for washing, drinking and watering gardens in dry times. I would rather not rely solely on well-water for these purposes, although living with the right people is more important to me, so I would compromise on my desire to use surface water for our needs in exchange for the right community. I would also love to implement good, simple rainwater catchment systems for these purposes.)

Secondly, the land would need to be fertile enough to easily support permaculture gardens, fruit trees, chickens and annual crops such as potatoes, carrots, beets, garlic, onions and greens. This would be taking into account composting of human manure to re-fertilize growing spaces.

Thirdly, the land would need to be part of or somewhat near to wild, undeveloped places, with ecosystems strong and abundant enough to support sustainable, ethical hunting and/or fishing for meat and foraging for wild foods. 

There are other aspects of the land which aren’t by any means essential but which would provide an advantage that I’d consider either important or just simply ‘nice.’ Obviously they are not all compatible with each other, and obviously a community/tribe could thrive without any of these, so this is why I don’t list them as essential. These include lush pasture for rotational grazing of domesticated farm animals, salmon streams, a long growing season, abundant sugar maples, and ocean or a large body of water within walking distance.

COMMUNITY VISION: 

My ideal for a community is one in which the members make a commitment to live and work together, with a common vision and with common values. 

A commitment to being together is essential. One of the main reasons for my dislike of the nuclear family model is that each family is working towards a separate goal of sustenance, making time spent together outside of the nuclear family rare. When we all have separate houses with separate meals to make, separate dishes to do, separate children to raise, separate gardens to tend, separate money to be made … where does that leave time to be together? If meals are usually shared, that means meal preparation and cleanup can be communal – and it means cooking and dishes can be more fun. If we raise our children together, we can share the responsibilities in ways that make sense for us and our children. If we work and build and grow food together, that can be more fun and more productive, too. Many hands make light work.

The vision of living together does not necessarily mean many families sharing one home, although it could easily take that form and work beautifully. It could mean many small, simple dwellings centered around a larger common space, where food is usually prepared and eaten communally in the common space … this seems to be the model in many traditional tribal cultures.

Making food central to community seems very important – food is central to our well-being, and with a shared vision of growing, raising and gathering our food communally – working together to nourish each other – it seems inevitable that we will see that we are all crucial to each other’s well-being. Because of this, in order to fully share meals, some overlap in dietary preferences seems necessary. It also seems like diet should be based on what the land can provide. It would be difficult to support a group of vegans in the arctic, for example.

Emotional maturity and making communication a priority, even in times of conflict and difficulty, seems essential in community. Meeting many different needs simultaneously can be difficult, and conflict is inevitable – it should be planned for. If we can listen to each other with respect and speak honestly and directly when we need to express something, conflict resolution can be graceful. Without a commitment to everyday openness and vulnerability, the natural flow of emotions will be blocked and tension will inevitably build. So it seems crucial that all involved in a community are ready to articulate their needs, feelings, worries, etc., and at the same time be willing to really make the time and space to listen to others when they need to speak. It also seems necessary to give each other emotional space, with forgiveness and understanding that we are all on our own path of self-discovery, and mistakes in how we communicate are possible, not cause for creating more distance between each other, but simply cause for further, deeper communication. Nonviolent communication could be a very helpful tool. 

My philosophy on being with children also holds a big space in my vision for community. They need respect and cooperation on the part of adults in the same way that we need respect and cooperation from them. If they are to grow into healthy community members, they need to be treated respectfully as human beings, and not as property. I want a children’s culture – a place where children are free to discover the world around themselves together through their play and exploration, or to join in with the tasks and projects of adults if they are interested. Respect for our children’s choices and their organic learning process is so important to me. Forcing children to comply with school, or even forced compliance with simple things like cleaning up, does not resonate with me. Naomi Aldort is an inspiration for me in this regard. Radical unschooling is an inspiration as well – not that school is inherently bad, but that the choice to attend school should be the child’s. All that being said, boundaries seem very necessary, as adults have needs too. It also seems necessary to have some parameters around children’s relationships with each other, specifically in terms of their conflict resolution – it seems only fair to guide their conflict resolution in a nonviolent way if a child is resorting to violence. Otherwise, it seems best to be aware but out of the way unless asked for. Respect for children starts in infancy – honoring their requests for closeness, comfort, and care through co-sleeping, breastfeeding on demand, etc., and through to their transition to adulthood by honoring their choices, as long as their choices do not interfere with the sovereignty/well-being of other humans. Through a balance of respect for our children’s choices and a commitment to vocalizing our own parental needs and requests, my hope is that a healthy parent-child dynamic will ensue, leading to greater respect and freedom for all.

Shared or communal childcare is also something that’s important to me, and something I am looking for in community.

Love for the earth and a commitment to working towards true sustainability is also so important. If we took the time to look at every facet of life to see if there is a simpler more gentle approach, we could greatly reduce dependence on industrially-produced tools and appliances. Minimal use of modern technology would be my ideal, obviously including electricity and gas, but with an open mind and a willingness to take an even deeper look at more simple technology to see if it actually improves quality of life or not, and if it does, what is the environmental impact of that technology and is it worth the trade-off? This would include prioritizing simplicity through natural building, simple tools for gardening, simple tools for cooking/food storage/food preservation, etc.

Another aspect of a tribe which I crave, but which would not necessarily be essential for me, is the regular sharing of celebrations. I am drawn towards pagan traditions in this regard, and would love to communally celebrate full moons, solstices and equinoxes, seasons, birthdays, weddings, coming-of-age, funerals… all of it. I feel like intentional celebration has the potential to greatly improve the health of a community!

The issue of meat is also one that I feel would play a role in community. Our family is omnivorous. We would strive to eventually raise or harvest all of our own meat, whether through ethical hunting and trapping, fishing, or pasture-raising farm animals, which would mean that a good deal of time each season would be dedicated to projects related to meat – slaughtering, butchering, preserving, hide tanning… etc. Animals do have many more similarities to humans than carrots or potatoes, which makes it easier for us to empathize with them. But carrots and potatoes are living beings too, with an incredible intelligence of their own. In order for life to be sustained, it needs to feed on life, and although taking the life of an animal can be devastatingly sad, our truth is that it is part of the natural cycle. So, we are not vegetarians, but we would not object to living with vegetarians.

How we deal with illness and healing might play a role in community life, and although I would be glad to live with humans with different philosophies on healthcare, I’d like to share my thoughts and personal philosophies in case they would cause conflict. I would prefer to, whenever necessary, have trust in my body’s immune system and ability to heal on its own. Susun Weed’s “six steps of healing” is an inspiration, as she starts out this way too – most of the time illness is caused by a physical or emotional imbalance that can be corrected through simple lifestyle changes or through emotional acceptance and release. If necessary, herbs can be a great ally. I would prefer to eventually grow and wild-gather herbs and tincture them, dry them, etc. to make an herbal pharmacy, with an emphasis of plants native to the region that I choose to call home, so as to be health-care self-sufficient. I have little or no interest in modern medicine, but I do have some interest in traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, and various healing modalities of native tribal people around the world.

We're interested in compassionate communication, community building, permaculture, eco-villages, sustainability, micro-farming, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/common-roots-co-op/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/common-roots-co-op/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are currently 2 adults with 2 children seeking like-minded individuals to create a co-housing community in the DC area. Currently we are focusing our search in the Prince George's County area, where currently no other IC's exist. The easily available and relatively affordable rural land, yet close proximity to the city make it a great option for people working in the city who want a communal, sustainable, slower pace of life within a reasonable commuting distance to Washington DC, Baltimore, and Annapolis.

We would love to find more individuals interested in getting in on the planning! We seek to create a diverse community and will not discriminate on the basis of age, gender, race or sexuality. We are flexible and diverse in our interests depending on the interests of the community. Personally we are interested in community building, gardening, sustainability, micro-farming and homesteading.

We are seeking democratic and and community-minded people who want to come together to care for the land and create community through various interests and shared spaces (like community gardens, jam nights, camp fires, potlucks, board game nights, etc.). We're looking for visionary and energetic people who want to join us in the planning stages and be a part of designing our mission and goals!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22885&quot;&gt;The Genome Collective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To create a sustainable model for the local food system of Binghamton, NY, and to educate students, households and businesses about urban farming, food reclaiming practices, and sustainable cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-genome-collective/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-genome-collective/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Genome Collective lives in Binghamton, NY. We welcome people of all ages, backgrounds, and identities who are excited about working together to create a collective home based around food justice, anti-oppressive values, art, and an egalitarian community lifestyle.

Rent for each resident-member varies from $250 to $450 a month, depending on ability to pay, living accommodations, and capacity to contribute to money-saving, sustainable activities. Rent includes all food, utilities, and household supplies.

More About Who We Are:
The Genome Collective was established in February 2016. The community lives in a roomy three-story Victorian house, located at 65 Park Avenue on the South Side of Binghamton.

What We Do: 
We strive to create a communal space open to as many people as possible, while also maintaining a safe, comfortable, and relaxing space for all of our members.

We keep a very well-stocked communal kitchen, and maintain a 1500-square-foot mushroom farm in our basement. We also keep about a 1/4-acre vegetable garden outside. 

We have an unattached garage, which we use as a wood shop, music studio, and bike shop. Above the garage there is an open temple space where we host yoga and meditation classes.

A significant portion of the Collective's food is dumpstered. We believe that dumpstering is a just method of obtaining and repurposing unsellable but nourishing food in order to feed as many people as possible while helping to fill a gap in our food distribution system.

We plan and hold community events about once a month.

We treat our house like a living organism. Our house guidelines and identity are articulated in a living document called the Genome, which community members regularly revisit and update to fit the Collective's needs as it grows and changes. We hold weekly meetings, make decisions via consensus, and strive to maintain a reciprocal relationship where the Collective actively supports and feeds the individuals that comprise it, and the individuals in turn support and feed the Collective.

You have beguiled me with desire, O Christ, and with love divine transformed me-- Orthodox Liturgy

We are a small, Orthodox Christian, community located at 155 Broadview Ave (East Toronto). We are seeking to build a communal life that is structured around the reality of God’s love in the midst of the city. Our life together is marked by the rhythms of prayer, study, liturgy, community life, and a variety of work motivated by a deep respect and love for the poor (our masters, as the early church reminds us). Some of our projects involve running a bakery, thrift store, visitor house, and creating spaces where people can exist without charge and come to discover their own value and mystery. Most recently, we are looking to find ways to be present for folks who are living in very difficult high rises in neighboring Scarborough. We are renting out apartments and attempting to participate more fully in the lives of these neighbors and looking for ways we can offer Xt (love, joy, beauty) into these spaces. All of this work is informed by an overarching attempt to live more deeply and boldly into the intoxicating vision of The Gospel and the Byzantine Liturgy. Though we are committed to the deep value of our tradition, our community includes people from a wide variety of traditions. We have a beautiful mission that is divided into two rooms. One is a place of outreach where dinners are served.  Our life has been deeply influenced by the writings of Jean Vanier, Dorothy Day, and the spirituality of the Little Brothers of Jesus. Applicants need not be orthodox but they would need to be interested in learning about this faith and participating in our liturgical and prayer life. Room and board can be provided. Interested folks should contact Gary at goneil327@gmail.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/st-john-the-compassionate-mission/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/st-john-the-compassionate-mission/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are small group of young adults (mostly in our late 20s and early 30s). The community was founded by a charismatic former Little Brother of Jesus who continues to live on top of the bakery. He is assisted in running the community by another young priest and an older deacon. We are trying to build a substantial lay wing to this community.</description>

      <name>Psytrance Bisexual community :)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22889&quot;&gt;Psytrance Bisexual community :)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Hi! Do you love psytrance? Are you bisexual?
if you said yes to both questions, then here is a piece of pie for you &amp;lt;3

Why psytrance, you might ask, and why bisexual only, you might also ask, you sillypie with oh so many questions.

I feel psychedelic trance provides the glue that will hold the community together. Psy trance has its own energy code we all know about and love. We can organize parties and why not our very own festival :D
We know if we all love psy-trance, then we probably have much in common, apart from our sexuality. 

Then why bisexual only? Because... because!
Yep, thorough answer to your questions.

Let&amp;#039;s grow together! and shine like buttercups &amp;lt;3

spirituality/shamanism allowed and encouraged. 

:)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/psytrance-bisexual-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/psytrance-bisexual-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ok I will use this to talk about logistics.

I chose Dutch forests, because:
They are in the midsts of beautiful nature, but also close to Amsterdam city.
Not sure if we will live in the actual forest, but at least nearby so we can have awesome walks there and pretend we are hobbits and elves.

We are a short flight away to most European cities like London, Berlin, etc, where the trance scenes are awesome. 
We are in Europe =  Psytrance festival season in the summer wohoooooooooo :E

Now, this community is &quot;Open Source&quot; so, anyone can suggest other alternatives, like, renting instead of buying, living nearer Amsterdam instead of in Veluwe, living in a big house versus living in small private houses, etc.

      <name>Urban Coup</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22892&quot;&gt;Urban Coup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Urban Coup will be a resilient, positive and diverse community that contributes to a healthier world, and one that enriches its residents' lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/urban-coup/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/urban-coup/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Urban Coup (the 'Coup') is an initiative of a group of Melbournians who share a vision of creating not just housing, but community...but more than this, home is where our community is, our family, friends – the networks that support and nourish us.

We are a cohesive community that is welcoming, supportive and inclusive of all individuals. We currently have two cohousing projects in development, driven by slightly different needs and the extensive shared knowledge of our memebership.

Urban Coup also presents a range of opportunities for engaging and sharing with diverse local communities via supportive activities. This may lead to partnership, social enterprise or simply manifest kinship within our local hood via volunteer activities. Examples include: a food cooperative; local garden and food exchange; skill exchange workshops; upcycling activities and support for diverse local causes. We actively encourage the development of cohousing communities in Australia. 

We have more than 35 members so far, but are always looking for more, as these members are divided between the two current projects. We also hope to be able to incorporate some social housing into the mix of accommodation, however this will depend on opportunities. 

'Near and Tall'

 Near and Tall is a high-density apartment development close to the CBD. This project is at an advanced stage of planning, with a partner architect and developer engaged, and is actively seeking participants as either owner/occupiers or investors. Members Contract Pack will be available for signature in late November, and a Terms Sheet will be available for investors five weeks later. Projected move-in date in December 2019.

'Far and Wide'

Far and wide is a lower-density garden-st development in the middle to outer suburbs. The project is in an earlier stage and is seeking participants to further develop the plan.

Real names for each project will be decided by the community based on the site, when it is secured. Urban Coup is a group of committed people preparing to purchase land and develop an environmentally sustainable urban cohousing community. We are a cohesive community that is welcoming, supportive and inclusive of all individuals. Both projects hope to purchase land and begin to build in 2017. 

Urban Coup was formed in May 2008, when a group of like-minded folk gathered to discuss their dreams of what living in such a community would be like. We found we had a lot in common and thus decided to work together to build first our group, and then the dream: a new co-housing community. We are now comprised of a healthy mx of couples, families and singles.

The group is made up of people from many different backgrounds, with health professionals, graphic artists, architects, designers, urban designers, environmentalists, engineers - who are now becoming friends. Currently, we meet fortnightly and often socialise before or after the meeting. We also go away together a couple of times a year to enjoy being in community whilst we build our dream. 

In this time, Urban Coup has developed an extensive invetory of healthy group processes and proactive ways of dealing with conflict should it arise. We operate under a consensus decision-making model and our conflict-resolution processes are based on the non-violent communications (NVC) approach. Members are offered training in both these group processes.

And the name? No, ‘coup’ is not a spelling mistake. The Urban Coup is our way of living differently to help ourselves to help the planet. Choosing to build a cohousing development is our answer to an age when global resources are being strained by modern living, urban sprawl is ever-expanding, and many of us in the city find ourselves isolated from real community in our current homes.</description>

      <name>Willow House Christian Intentional Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22893&quot;&gt;Willow House Christian Intentional Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Indeed we share expenses and space to ease the economic burden of living. But more importantly, we believe that by living together we will see one another as we really are, which will (we hope) lead us individually and corporately to repentance, forgiveness, grace, and growth as we seek Jesus together.

We are completely on the grid as we are limited by the surrounding infrastructure and fiscally. We do have a wood-burning fireplace and hope for a wood stove at some point.

We don't grow much food on our property, though we grow a little more each year. Alternatively, we seek to support local farmers through CSA's (for produce) and herd share (for raw dairy). One of us runs a natural foods co-op and we get a lot of our food from there too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/willow-house-christian-intentional-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/willow-house-christian-intentional-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We're just a group of normal 20- and 30-somethings living completely on the grid in urban Roanoke, Virginia. We have four bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, a cute little dog, and a lot of love. We might have an extra room for you.

It costs a little bit of money. Unfortunately, we do have bills!

We're college-educated, grow / eat as organically / locally / ethically as we can, read a lot, cook a lot, enjoy good beer and bourbon (if it isn't a stumbling block for someone), and like to talk about things that are meaningful. Most of all, we love, love, love Jesus. That's what this is really about. Fellowship. Iron sharpening iron. Exhortation. Living as biblically as we know how. We go to All Nations Church. We don't care where you go as long as it's biblical and you're committed. That's how this can work.

We have interfaith friends and love people who believe differently than us, but our home is not interfaith; that is not the purpose right now. Consider us your friendly urban Roanoke monastery that affirms secular jobs and marital hanky-panky -- or just a kind of faith-based intentional community.

      <name>Quaker House Residential Community (QHRC)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22895&quot;&gt;Quaker House Residential Community (QHRC)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Experiment in Quaker community under the care of Ann Arbor Friends Meeting, committed to diversity and inclusivity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/quaker-house-residential-community-qhrc/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/quaker-house-residential-community-qhrc/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;QHRC is a small intentional living community. We share and care for a beautiful six-bedroom, turn-of-the-twentieth-century house in Ann Arbor, close to the University of Michigan's central campus. 

We strive to embody our strong commitments to: multi-cultural/ intergenerational/ racial/ ethnic/ LGBT inclusivity; delicious, healthy meals; simple, economical, and environmentally friendly living; mature, stable, supportive relationships; and open, forthright, and honest communication.

Quaker membership is not required though we respect and uphold the spiritual leadings of the Ann Arbor Friends Meeting (peace, nonviolence, social justice, and respect for all).

Regular evening meals are a central activity of the QHRC. Each housemate cooks for the others a few times a month, and participates in weekly and monthly chores as well as regular house meetings; this participation totals approximately ten hours per week. A monthly financial contribution is required. There is a formal application process.

The first floor of Quaker House is frequently used for community events. The second and third floors are exclusively used by residents. The house is smoke free. Pets are not allowed. At least a one-year commitment preferred. 

Quaker House has had a varied history. From 1955, when Friends purchased it, until 1962, it served as the meetinghouse. For many years it housed an international student cooperative. In 1983, the Meeting discerned that “The purpose of Quaker House is to enrich the life of the Meeting and to carry forward the testimonies, values, and concerns of Friends through outreach to the wider community.” Between 1984 and 1991 Quaker House was home for a refugee family from El Salvador and for a small community of Quakers from the Meeting. Since 1991, Quaker House has been home to the Quaker House Residential Community (QHRC), a cooperative living community under the care of the Meeting. 

This community was originally envisioned by the Ann Arbor Friends Meeting as &quot;a small group of people living in Quaker House and exploring what Quaker community means. We feel that Quaker principles such as seeking the Light, speaking to that of God in every person, living simply, and making decisions by consensus are wonderful underpinnings for creating such a community. The group’s exploration may lead it into spiritual sharing and deepening; new ways of working, struggling, and celebrating with each other; and/or providing each other with support and challenge to reach out to the larger community.&quot;</description>

Each member shares in house chores, working the garden about three hours a week, and communal prayer or meditation at least twice a week. Each member is self-supporting with outside compensated work and contributes toward the household expenses of shared living spaces, private bedroom, garden expenses, utility bills, and other household expenses.</description>

      <name>Eashira Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22900&quot;&gt;Eashira Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are an intentional community built around multi-generational households committed to sustainable living and shared resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/eashira-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/eashira-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;There was a time when multiple generations of families lived together in the same household or the same community for both ease and economy. Over the past few generations this concept has been lost in American culture, and many feel we are worse off for it. Each generation is pushed out of the home they were raised in, to build their life from scratch, shouldering tremendous financial burdens just to replace the family home they left. Children are disconnected from their grandparents and other relations. Parents are often left to carry the load of caring for and raising their family, on their own. 
We understand the need for privacy and independence as generations mature, and our village can provide this without being so disconnected from other generations. Our homes and land are designed and arranged for both private spaces and shared spaces within a household. We even extend the multigenerational concept so that a household contains multiple generations of multiple families. This further enriches the lives of everyone in the community and it allows us to share resources, skills, and experiences.
Our buildings are designed with “aging in place” features to accommodate families in all stages of life. This includes features such as wide doors, ground floor accommodations for mobility impaired family members, grab rails, easy to operate handles, minimal obstructions, and non-slip surfaces. Households have a variety of spaces for everyone from single adults, couples, or larger families, to accommodate everyone as their needs change.  
Having multiple generations of multiple families living in the same community, or even the same household has many advantages:
•	Family members experience the high level of emotional bonding and closeness across generations.
•	Older generations provide important role models in the socialization of children. Younger generations learn how to care for their elders.
•	Spending time with children can bring purpose and meaning to the lives of older generations. For example, the physical demands of keeping up with kids and helping with homework make them feel younger, more useful, and active.
•	Grandparents help grandchildren survive changes in their parent’s domestic structure by giving grandchildren undivided attention and helping when single parents are overwhelmed. 
•	Multigenerational families have financial benefits for everyone involved. If grandparents are in good health and willing, they can help care for young children. Adult children living in the multifamily household can save money while going to school, finding a job or saving money to buy their own shares in the village company.
•	Family members provide constant companionship, as well as help reduce financial strain and stress.
•	Village members look after, help and support each other.
•	Bringing village members together can be a joyful time to treasure and share.
•	While you have the ability for solitary time to yourself, you are never so isolated as to feel lonely or on your own.</description>

All are welcome regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion. We are looking to share the rent on an apartment or small house in Norman, depending on how many new members we have. Among our members are Buddhists, Pagans, Christians, and Hindus (and we are open to others!) and we share our spiritual paths with each other.

(tentative statement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/a-watership-down/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/a-watership-down/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;It was something to think about after occupy...

We needed something, anything, so we consensed...then we travelled...then we worked...then we suffered...then we died...because it wasn't actually sustainable...it wasn't even livable...and ultimately it wasn't survivable.

This option removes the encumbrance of land ownership, which arguably is impossible--or at the least incredibly injust--in these united states...

You can be a nomad anywhere.
You can help others anywhere.

Primarily sailboats.
Secondarily water-based living.
Tertiary nomadic lifestyle.

At the center is collaborative shared space, dorm/hostel style. We are quickly acquiring new spaces in order to offer infinite indoor and outdoor living spaces. We are building collaborative relationships in our surrounding community that offer infinite fulfillment for all. We are experiencing ways of being in the world that work for everyone. We are focused on healing, spiritual practice, and being intentional in all aspects of life. We have intentions of offering healing retreats as well as regular collective healing practices for all in the community. We are a block away from an urban farm and market, across the street from a beautiful park, two blocks away from an amazing artistic intentional community, a block away from Atlanta’s beltline (a paved multi-purpose trail that traverses the city and has infinite community building properties), and walkable to an eco-friendly library. The connective and healing potential of our village is infinite. People are contributing in infinite ways, contributing the joy and the gifts that they are. For those contributing financially, it is currently infinitely affordable at 300.00/month. All things are possible. Reach out to us as you feel warmly drawn and explore the beautiful possibilities for collaboration! Thank you!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22916&quot;&gt;Petawawa Tribal - Shared Housing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To provide a shared household where members can rely on one another, form bonds and with the saved time and resources of sharing, have more free time to enjoy the important things in life. We prioritize social connection, feasts of real food together and playing together. Hiking, sports, movie nights, board game nights and art nights are held in the household. 

Healthy and balanced living is important to us. Mindfulness practices are part of the routine of several members already, and we use circadian lighting throughout the entire house to support everyone's hormonal balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/petawawa-tribal-shared-housing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/petawawa-tribal-shared-housing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We have been interested in living in an intentional community and eco villages but modern circumstances of career mean we live in Petawawa, Ontario. So we decided to move in to a shared housing unit. We made friends over the last year and now the members of that shared household have gotten together to share a complete house together. 

While we aren't right out in nature, its a 5-minute walk to the rapids and there's plenty of wilderness about. In this house we love cooking, eating and playing together. There is a big table where we share feasts and meals of real food and love playing board games.

Let's call Petawawa Tribal an unintentional group that decided to form an intentional community. 

It's a bilingual household, so if you need practice then we'll be happy to oblige. 

Members come from diverse backgrounds but are respectful, helpful and friendly.</description>

We are a skill-sharing community with ongoing learning and production of our own food, energy and entertainment.  In this way we reduce our income needs and need for outside resources; but continue to integrate with the local and regional community in order to not become reclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/earthen-heart-community-homestead/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/earthen-heart-community-homestead/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Earthen Heart is a 20 acres parcel in Southwest Michigan.  It is being developed as an Eco-Habitat with permaculture principles.  The main home is a renovated old farm house with 3 bedrooms. The main house also has shared community community space for meals, showers, laundry, Internet and phone, yoga space, grid-connection etc. There are several outbuildings and space for trailers, campers, campsites for tents or earthen buildings, etc. which are used by visitors and long term members on the property. 

After 7 years, Phase II of Earthen Heart has begun in 2018!  We will be offering short term stays through Air B&amp;amp;B in order to generate income to fund the management of the property and ongoing development.  We are also looking for qualified and financially stable individuals to consider a more long term stay as well.  That is why we continue to list here.

The Earthen Heart goal is to create a lean rural alternative where we live more simply and reduce our consumption levels but increase our quality of life.  We strive to generate more of our own food, housing, art and energy on-site in a skill sharing educational growing community.  We have walking perennial food and medicine trails and gardens, blueberry patch, garlic and onions, potatoes, corn, fruit and nuts, many greens, asparagus, strawberries, etc.  Generally there are some domestic and farm animals around such as chickens, goats, dogs, cats.</description>

We are over one hour away from the two larger towns of Cabo San Lucas and La Paz.  Todos Santos is an artistic community with many art studios and yoga classes. 

I have friends in our neighborhood that bought land around 2004 and built houses of all kinds...big, little, some sustainable and made with alternative building materials. There is a mix of gringo and Mexican people.  We live in a neighborhood where the lots are reasonably priced so that the co-housing/neighbornet idea can take hold easily.  (Also, there are some rentals available off and on.)  This proposed ecovillage is a loosely defined geographical area comprised of privately owned households. 

Our vision is that people buy their own piece of land whether they are a family, single person or group.  Then everyone will donate some money to buy collectively a piece of land where we can build whatever we want to do collectively....share meals, share child-rearing, elder care, garden, ecological projects, art projects, natural building, alternative energy projects, etc.  The vision is to help each other in the details of living, while we create a community that emphasizes sustainability, living sacred with the earth and supporting each other.   Members participate when they want to.  There are no mandatory activities.  We are just forming, so the details are yet to be created.</description>

Our outlook and values are pragmatic and centered on making life easier for our housemates by sharing the work of the home together with a focus on permaculture, sustainability and yogic principles. We do form strong bonds among members that are reminiscent of an idealized family. The central purpose of our community is derived from shared values of generosity toward co-living members, the earth and the wider community, a sense of service both to the home we inhabit and the members we live with, and a strong central work ethic both in our own lives and in service of the home, earth and community with which we live in partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/living-room-yoga-commune/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/living-room-yoga-commune/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Residents unite around a common interest to collaboratively manage a space, share resources, and coordinate activities which contribute creatively and intellectually to the world around them. We offer short-term accommodation and host outward facing events, increasing connections with the broader community and world. The community at Living Room Yoga Commune is focused on the principles of permaculture, yoga, and resilient living. Many housemates are a member of hOur Exchange Ypsilanti Time bank, which is connected to other timebanks in the county, state region and the world through the use of hOur World software.</description>

The house is owned by a married couple who live as part of the co-op with their 2 children. We have adequate space for 11 long-term members maximum, which includes 3 two-three room suites for couples/small families, 1 &quot;in-law quarters&quot; apartment with private kitchen and access, and 2 single bedrooms. 

We share housing to create a space to practice &quot;mindful living&quot; with the support and accountability of a small group. Through open dialogue and consensus-based agreements and practices, we try to understand and support one another's vocations, reduce expenses by splitting costs, reduce resource usage, and offer one another positive social support. We seek to be a safe space for people of diverse orientation, perspective and background.</description>

Our roots stem from the Ecumenical Institute/Institute of Cultural Affairs, in whose building we are housed, but we've been through many iterations. Although we lease space (individually) from ICA and some or many of us are either employed by or volunteer for ICA programs, we are not officially affiliated with ICA. About 33 of us live on two floors of the ICA GreenRise Learning Laboratory. We range from 15 to 88 years old and are racially/ethnically diverse.</description>

We are partnering with those who provide the resources necessary to make this a reality, for all of us, no matter where we are.  
OUR FOCUS:
FOOD, FAMILY &amp;amp; SAFETY

All people everywhere deserve to have the ability to grow and harvest good and highly nutritious food. Reviving the family unit by providing resources for developing simple self-sufficient and sustainable lifestyles. Creating safely balanced environments while ensuring prosperity and providence.  
 This requires our focus to become defined as:

Food Security
Energy Security 
Energy-Efficient Architecture
Pure Water
A Prosperity Plan on the land that regenerates and profits year after year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/venus-development-project/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/venus-development-project/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Venus Development Project has many things to do this year. We will be showcasing some closed farming systems as well as learning to work with the land in a good way. We will be farming sweet grass, hemp, and food. We work with an organization called Living Earth Solutions and they provide us with many sustainable and self-sufficient templates to work with. Our intention is to grow into a learning center that will support the local women's shelter and provide education and training in self-sufficiency to them.  We are currently looking for those who would like to be apart of this property in its beginning stages.</description>

      <name>The Abrahadabra Institute</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22941&quot;&gt;The Abrahadabra Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Obligatory Disclaimer:
The Abrahadabra Institute is a repository and distribution center for occult-related art, information and technology.
It is not affiliated with the OTO, the Golden Dawn, or any other ritual magickal organization.

• Premise #1:
Every man and every woman is a star.
• Premise #2:
Abrahadabra is an encrypted key to intrastellar transformation.
• Premise #3:
The Physics of the Body of Light is humankind’s surest path to Completion.

These are the core assumptions that define the Abrahadabra Institute. These are the things we seek to validate without reliance upon or commitment to any other religious, philosophical or metaphysical influence. We are determined to arrive at an irrefutable accounting of these core assumptions on all coherent levels, with special attention paid to the underlying physics. If we view these central tenets as an evolutionary imperative generally lost on the vast majority of human beings, it is clear that they will have to be recognized before being acted upon skillfully enough to affect any meaningful change. Since a hugely successful body of work already exists combining over 40 years of investigative research and aggressive experimentation, we are actively involved in the social networking this precedent logically beckons. This networking assumes a healthy range of manifest forms both artistic and academic. Whatever we may do to reach a larger receptive audience, we are steeped in the intrinsic meta-science underscoring this unique star model at every pass. It is important that the Abrahadabra Institute establish and maintain strong connections with as diverse a pool of forward thinking individuals as possible since our unfolding model anticipates overwhelming validation at the highest levels of artistic and scientific expertise alike. We know of no other Body of Light thesis in this world that has any rational hope of achieving this. We have a great many proofs to reveal at present, but the greatest proofs are yet to come.

!gridproofs-template

For the benefit of those who have not heard of Abrahadabra, it is a modern reconfiguration of an ancient word of power purported to be invested with uniquely *magickal* qualities that has been hailed down through the centuries as especially auspicious, particularly with respect to bodily health and vigor. Its true origins have never been completely sorted out but it comes to us in written form via the Roman physician Quintus Severus Sammonicus in the 2nd century A.D. referencing a certain Abracadabra incantation technique (found on certain amulets and charms referred to as Abraxas stones) among the Gnostics. It was said to be successful in the reduction of fevers, dispelling of assorted maladies and was also useful as a spell for returning lost or stolen items, among other things! There are conflicting interpretations as to its meaning, but its geometry has never been in doubt. Formed from 66 letters in 11 sequential rows, arranged with 11 letters at the top, descending to 1 letter at the bottom, we arrive at a perfect inverted triangle of letters equivalent to (but not always strictly displaying) the entire word repeated exactly 6 times. This word can be posited in either an ascending or descending direction. If descending, the word-glyph is thought to have the power to reduce; if ascending, to exalt. It is perhaps the most basic (yet enduring) example we have of *word magick* as understood in ancient times that is still perfectly recognizable as such in modern times.

Aleister_Crowley

While the magickal formula of Abrahadabra does not actually originate with Aleister Crowley, he certainly positioned it for maximum exposure with respect to the upcoming Aeon of Horus. His Liber Al vel Legis (aka the Book of the Law) has proven to be a significant game-changer for occult philosophy in the modern era, where Abrahadabra is linked to praeter-human stars and the corresponding notion of Completion. It is not the province of the Abrahadabra Institute to either endorse or discredit Aleister Crowley with respect to those austerities he declares of himself. That is for his readers to decide as he would almost certainly be the first to insist upon. The Abrahadabra Institute’s official position on Aleister Crowley is that the sum of his work qualifies him as the premier star theorist of his generation. There is abundant evidence to grant him this distinction in our reasonably expert opinion and there are certain topics we may periodically engage that would not be possible without the precedents he laid in. Having said this, it must also be admitted that Aleister Crowley was much better at initiating vital transformational discourse than he was at qualifying his arguments, or even doing an adequate job of presenting relevant facts in their proper order. For that we most often need qualified specialists and there is no shortage of logical holes left hanging in the balance with respect to the conversation of Abrahadabra and its relevancy to praeter-human stars.

Although the Abrahadabra Institute is rooted in the magickal formula of Abrahadabra, its overall mission is by no means confined to this alone. It came online in the Spring of 2002 under the auspices of abrahadabra.com which hosted the (now dismantled) Abrahadabra Forums. Abrahadabra Forums was a grand (albeit tumultuous) experiment in what we came to call open-source occultism where a sacred space was created to discuss Abrahadabra and everything related to it in some apparent way. What we soon discovered was that this magickal formula is amply deserving of its reputation as the *Word of the Aeon* since there seemed to be nothing of merit pertaining to modern occultism that it did not integrate with and contribute to in some distinctive fashion. Literally hundreds of sub-forums were created to keep pace with all the specialized topics people wanted to discuss until finally, after 11 years (and millions of unique hits per month) it was decided that it had ultimately served its useful purpose. Abrahadabra Forums has had a demonstrable impact on the worldwide web and will be missed for the quality of discussions and presentations housed there, but time is of the essence and it is time for us to enter into a more proactive professional phase of networking operations.

This is because the Abrahadabra Institute is in a unique position to impart vital Body of Light principles and assimilation techniques completely unavailable anywhere else on Earth. When we defer to Abrahadabra, we are referencing what we know to be a comprehensive physics of consciousness quite unlike anything that has ever been consciously perfected. Not only are we able to define exactly what praeter-human stars are (based upon its innate syncretic properties), but can also train people with enormous confidence to emulate and maintain that state of physiological perfection going forward in their daily lives. While we are still only at the threshold of the most exciting epoch in human history, the model of Completion that the Abrahadabra Institute is privy to is hands-down the most powerful transformational technology ever captured in this world. So in phase 2 of the Abrahadabra Institute’s networking agenda we are going to be raising up self-initiated stars one dedicated practitioner at a time. We have everything in place to accomplish this right now so there is no good reason to postpone it. There is also no reason for anyone to fear what they might have to sacrifice to embark upon this transformational work since Abrahadabra does not amount to a belief system in itself and does not demand anything in payment for the rewards it has to offer. It is an alchemical projection discipline of the highest order; a remarkably potent visualization practice that is inclusive rather than exclusive. It may subtly change the way you view certain things but that is between you and yourself alone.

There is nothing that the Abrahadabra Institute extols that requires anyone to believe a certain way.
It is the nearest thing to *the method of science – the aim of religion* that has ever touched down in this world to date.

m1thr0s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-abrahadabra-institute/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-abrahadabra-institute/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Ouroboros Lodge, Gallup, NM (was: The Nuit House, Olympia WA)

Greetings,

The Abrahadabra Institute is an occult organization unaffiliated with any other ritual magickal organization, it has been active in the global occult community since 2003 and its founder, m1thr0s, a Hermetic Alchemist who founded the discipline of Mutational Alchemy has been involved in the American occult community since 1970. Our loosely knit organizational structure is a testament to the lack of interest we hold in forming a religion, church or a following. Individualism is very important to us and strikes a discord with many “intentional community” types more often than not, who prefer to be lead. We are leaders but do not particularily want to have people following us around so we take a different approach to membership and followers than most other organizations. In this sense we are more akin to the A.’.A.’. than anything else, which is purported to be wholly universal anyways and requires no strict dogma or even much adherence to any rules but one’s own True Will. This True Will is wholly up to the individual. This makes us attractive to artists and those sick of silly religions, interested in learning together abut the mysteries of the old religions, the occult, new ways of occultism and alchemy, and finding ways to perfection.

Our original house was The Nuit House an Olympia, WA, micro-intentional community intended to be a knowledge-focused community, with little focus on natural living and more focus on an urban artist setting.The house mutated within a year into strictly and artist collective, then back to just occultists, then a mix, then no particular focus at all. Now we’re focused on creating a larger intentional community and focusing on the American cultural zeitgeist that is often embodied in Visionary Art and Nu Aeon technologies. Aleister Crowley’s Abbey of Thelema is a touchstone for us, obviously, as we are called *The Abrahadabra Institute* as are many retreat centers worldwide. Core members are occultists. The Abrahadabra Institute is focused on the formula of Abrahadabra and the Body of Light. (See Isaac Luria, Lurianic Kabbalah, The I Ching, the Tai Tsuan Ching)

We are now located in a great adobe with an adjacent TLC-needed mobile housing unit. We are in the Wild West in a great little city that is also a wordwide tourist destination due to the vast diversity of American Indian tribes and Wild West culture here in historic Gallup, NM. We are two blocks South of historic Route 66 and two blocks from Downtown Gallup. It's a great location for The Abrahadabra Institute, and because we have a secure plot now that is in the family and we can relax into some heavy duty renovations and work. I’m STILL interested in how living harmoniously with other people you’re not related to in an urban enviroment can reduce stress and waste, in comparison to typical urban boxes that only house 1-2 people.

Over the years members have been a diverse mix and I’ve learned a lot about running things smoothly, and am always willing to share my experience in a running a micro-IC in an urban setting with an Arts focus.

People interested in The Abrahadabra Institute should visit abrahadabra.com and get to know our materials available online. Those interested in the house may contact me  For those interested seriously in the Abrahadabra Institute’s work, space can be made but everyone pulls their weight financially in the house, it isn’t a rich guy’s house where you get free utilities and do LSD all day in some kind of utopia. I think some people get that idea, so while that may sound crazy it is necessary to say it to some. I don't even particularily like that idea of community since it smacks of laziness and I do not want lazy people in our organization. In the past in The Nuit House all working class people or students and making life work for us in the best way we can, having fun living together affordably in a harmonious knowledge-focused enviroment. If we have a future it will be because of the generosity and support of people who believe in what we are doing.

Now that we have managed to secure a nice urban plot in a very desirable city located close to tons of outdoor opportunities for rituals and within reach of traditional American Indian peoples who know the ins and outs of Shamanism (medicine ways), we can really expand our occult activities. We’re doing what little we can to try to grow and prosper. It isn’t easy, and I know how hard it can be to start and maintain these things with all of the baggage people can bring into a situation they are not spiritually and mentally prepared for. So if you need any advice in your IC situation feel free to contact me for any reason.

Although we we are liturgically and theologically an Old Catholic Monastery we are intentional in our commitment to be ecumenical and welcome all Christians within the community.
Our monastery is unique in that it will be integrated in many ways. We will integrate both male and female, celibate and non-celibate, family and single. We will also integrate the various monastic traditions like Franciscan, Benedictine, Trappist, and many others. We will balance contemplative and charismatic, stable (i.e., living in one place) and itinerant (i.e., traveling); solitary and communal; and eremitical and active ministry.

The monastic members will work by farming/gardening, office work, cooking, cleaning, and maintenance of the grounds and buildings. Part of our life will deal with the manual tasks of making the Monastery as self-sufficient as possible to decrease our costs.</description>

We want to create a living space where families and individuals of all ages and Jewish sects will live together, enjoy dinner together daily and share the news of their day. A warm and friendly home where folks can enjoy Jewish holidays and celebrations.  Where the familiar, warmth and heimishness of Jewish traditions can be shared, however, with the nuances and individuality that accompany modern progressive values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/avrahams-tent-the-jewish-intentional-community-of-san-diego/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/avrahams-tent-the-jewish-intentional-community-of-san-diego/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Working together to create a Jewish Intentional community / urban kibbutz in San Diego, where it’s warm and sunny 364 days/year.
We will build a sustainable multi-generational community grounded in the Jewish calendar and Jewish values. Singles, couples, and families of all ages and backgrounds are welcome. We envision a community that feels like home: warm, familiar and heimische (Yiddish for warm, homey, down-to-earth, and familiar).
As a community, we will 
celebrate Jewish holidays and take these opportunities to gather together with our friends, families, and neighbors;
provide creative Jewish programming and education for children and adults;
create opportunities for interfaith learning and partnerships.
The community will have 
-a large common area including an industrial kitchen and eating area that can accommodate 2-3 times the number of all occupants. 
-a large outdoor area for flexible use: gatherings, picnics, etc.
-edible garden
-20-30 “family” units, i.e., 25-60 adults. Each unit:
• has 1-6 people and has their own private “tiny” living space, with their own sleeping, living and cooking areas.
• is expected to a) pay for their living space plus “maintenance” fees that will cover food, cleaning, and more, b) work outside the community, c) contribute certain # of hours per month to preparing communal meals.</description>

Palm bay, Florida. Respect for ALL. Harmony. Kindness. Inclusion.
Warm regards.
15 minutes west of the Ocean, I have a 2/1 house on 1/3 acre - with many fruit trees and plants as well as vegetable gardens and a small hydroponic system. I am planting annual vegetables as well as perennial greens and food plants. I also grow nectar plants for pollinators. I just bought a wooded lot next door so now have about 6/10 acre. I would love to have a few or more folks assist with building a  house and workshop here, as well as, to plant a food forest and enlarge the gardens. Possibly acquire other nearby houses as a connected suburban - community?  I have no debt. I am a lifelong artist - sculptor - painter.  Potential exists for an art based enterprise or a food based project, a myriad of possibilities is swirling! -  Open to discussions! The site refers to a farm I sold in n. Florida, my first attempt at a shared community... - the land and house I now have is mid - east coast Florida - south of the space center 30 miles or so. I am 63, powerful, strong - spiritual. I - meditate daly and have for 40 and more years, vegetarian, artist, musician, (music studio and acoustic - electric instruments available) Art equipment and tools available.... smoke 420 and drink wine. hoping to find folks who could assist in a project and might invest $ and labor for a shared ownership or long term living arrangement.  Open to anything - including a larger property if others participate.  Now, located in a residential neighborhood - the large back yard is very private and fenced.

Whether it will be a commune or more independent is something we should all decide together, as well as other rules. It will be a spiritual community, but all faiths (or absence of) are welcome. We will try to live sustainably and off grid. Health will be of importance here. That being said the following habits are permitted: alcohol, tobacco, cannabis. It will be a community where there are more guidelines than rules. We will participate in activism. We also plan to be a hub for music, art, and poetry where people can learn and teach others also.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22961&quot;&gt;West Los Angles Community House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission is to be a welcoming, inclusive, family oriented community house in West Los Angeles.  We are cooperating and collaborating in order to maximize our personal and professional effectiveness while  increasing our quality of life and sense of belonging.  Through &quot;think tank&quot; planning we plan to grow out of this house and repurpose or customize a larger community property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/west-los-angles-community-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/west-los-angles-community-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;After many years of searching the world for a community to join, we have regrouped at our launchpad property in West LA and decided to form our own! 

We are kid/pet/LGBTG/musician-friendly community open to all faiths. Our values are progressive, and we are very grounded in practical day-to-day family life; learning to grow as human beings together in a collaborative and loving environment. We are inclusive of ALL-ternative lifestyles and family styles. Burners, makers and activists are more than welcome.

Our home is in Rancho Park, one of the most desirable neighborhoods in West Los Angeles. The main 7-bedroom house is spacious, with 3 full bathrooms and a large kitchen for communal meals. Across the compound-like yard is a garage housing a workshop and a 1 bed/1 bath cottage. 

We are short walk to the Expo line, Trader Joe's, and all shopping, etc at the Westside Pavilion. The Santa Monica pier is just a 10 minute train ride away, and we are in close proximity to both UCLA &amp;amp; USC.

We currently have two rooms available in the main house, and additional rooms will be available starting in July, and are inviting those who are interested to connect with us. 

We aim to be a welcoming, inclusive, family-oriented community house in West Los Angeles. Our mission is to cooperate and collaborate both personally and professionally to maximize our effectiveness and sense of belonging while at the same time increasing our quality of life and making a positive impact in the greater world. 

This is just the beginning. We are looking long-term to acquire and customize or re-purpose a larger community property to accommodate our ever-growing family. All that's missing, is you. 

Come join us.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22963&quot;&gt;Emberi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Changing the system within which humans live, to improve their condition and protect our world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/emberi/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/emberi/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We seek to CHANGE THE SYSTEM.

We believe that the single biggest problem in existence today is GREED.

Emberi (&quot;EM-bur-ee&quot;) is a Hungarian word meaning &quot;the condition of being human&quot;. Right now, the Human Community of Emberi exists only online, but at some point it will have to become established physically.

We seek people who are dissatisfied with the way the system works - people who have a deep and well-thought-out desire to change the system, and the world. The Emberish system will inevitably become the way of the world sometime whether we make it happen or not - the only question is, will the transition be smooth or will it cause the eradication of most of the human race?

We seek to make it a smooth transition. The current system is responsible for all of the negativity experienced by humans of all types, and it is untenable. Someday the non-renewable resources we currently call &quot;wealth&quot; will run out, and the system as we know it will cease to operate. If this transition occurs abruptly, which will happen if change is not started now, most of the human race will die - either from starvation or from the widespread pandemonium that will erupt as soon as people become aware that they won't be able to obtain food easily.

We operate by the Four Emberish Principles:

PRINCIPLE 1 (The Preservation of Humanity Principle): Do nothing to any other person, directly or indirectly, which causes that person undesired harm or negativity.

(This Principle is ABSOLUTELY never to be violated unless your very survival depends upon violating it in an emergency situation, even if preserving it means you violate other Principles. They are all subordinate to Principle 1.)

PRINCIPLE 2 (The Golden Rule Principle): Treat other people in the same way in which you would want to be treated if you were in their exact same situation.

PRINCIPLE 3 (The Communal Living Principle): Contribute to Emberi according to your ability, and take from Emberi only as much as you need.

PRINCIPLE 4 (The Goodness of Humanity Principle): All humans are to be considered GOOD by nature and treated as such.

(When they do &quot;bad&quot;, which nearly all people do today, it's because of having been programmed badly by the current system, which Emberi seeks to change and will eventually change.)

The only acceptable violations of any of these Principles will be due to complete accident or unintentional oversight.

We seek people who are passionate about changing the system, to join us and help us cement the system that will be best for all humans going forward. Find our Facebook group and join up there, to be part of the discussion about the best way to improve the condition of humanity going forward.</description>

We do not kill any living creature and teach others the act of non-violence (ahimsa). We strive to minimize or cause no harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/peaceful-village-and-intentional-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/peaceful-village-and-intentional-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Peaceful Village is an intentional vegan community and blueprint for creating a peaceful world. Concept started in 2014. We had a temporary land in Belize in 2017 and will reassemble in the near future. Our aim is to create a peaceful vegan community and world and create blueprint for people to create their own communities. If you would like to help with this project in any way please get in touch with us at peacefulvillage@protonmail.com

Mission
At the Peaceful Village, our aim is to create an eco-sustainable community, another way of living, a just and peaceful world through vegan education.

Michael Lanfield
Certified World Peace Diet Facilitator, vegan advocate, and author of five books, including two Amazon best-sellers; The Interconnectedness of Life and The Journey, Michael has garnished 15,000 YouTube subscribers, and 5 million video views and millions more through Facebook, Google+, Instagram, and others. He has written the forward to Mango Wodzak’s newest book The Eden Fruitarian Guidebook.

The basic values for this community include:
 
1.  No being is viewed as property, to be used or harmed in any way, whenever possible. We at the Peaceful Village at Finca Del Soul cherish all life, therefore everyone is vegan while living on or visiting the land. We follow the principle of “ahimsa” or harmlessness where we refrain from injuring any living creature and cause the least harm whenever possible. This includes refraining from the consumption of animal foods and products that contain animal ingredients, as well as, animals used in entertainment, for testing, clothing, or other uses, as much as possible and practicable. We value all animal’s freedom; therefore, we do not participate in the keeping of companion animals “pets” at the Peaceful Village, but rather live harmoniously with naturally free roaming animals in nature.
 
2.  We value every human animal equally and reject all forms of discrimination. We treat everyone as we want to be treated, with kindness, love, and respect.
 
3. Not to take what is not given, but to respect the property of others. At the Peaceful Village, we refrain from taking the property, life, time, or life-energy or others if not given freely directly to us.
 
4. Not to engage in sexual misconduct. This refers to any action of body, speech or mind that sees another as an object for our own self-gratification or against another's free will.
 
5. Not to lie but to speak the truth. We avoid telling falsehoods or exaggerations, internally or externally, through any deceitful action, word or thought, with the intent to harm others.
 
6.  Not to consume alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and cigars. We at the Peaceful Village believe in order to be at peace and harmony, we need not consume any substances that negatively affect the heart or mind.
 
7. We respect nature and avoid using harmful chemicals, minimizing our ecological footprint as much as possible. Therefore, we implement veganic permaculture practices in harmony with the Earth.</description>

Cohousing is an important way to combat the social isolation our culture often confronts us with. This is a group that is in the early stages of forming. The very broad goal is to be a cohousing community for all ages, orientations, and backgrounds in an urban location in Portland, Oregon. We are starting from scratch so please bring your ideas and experience during the crucial formative process recognizing that it will be several years before this becomes a reality!</description>

      <name>Wilder Waters Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22989&quot;&gt;Wilder Waters Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our mission statement is to establish and maintain an eco-centered community that allows sovereign humans to experience healthy social interactions, deep connections to the landscape, and sustainable living in a manner that reinforces our biological and ancestral norms and honors the need for humans to interact in a cooperative manner with other wild beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/wilder-waters-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/wilder-waters-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We began Wilder Waters Community here on 150 acres of forest in central Maine—a real community, based on our ancestral birthright to a deep connection with each other and the land. A community where we share food, but also other types of nourishment: songs, stories, and rituals. Where the economy is based on reciprocity rather than extraction. Where the nuclear home is replaced by the community lodge, and life is lived according to the principles knit in your bones.

We were all physically, emotionally, and spiritually sick of living in opposition to our ancestors-- living without community. That's why we began Wilder Waters Community on 150+ acres of forest here in central Maine. We are a small tribe of people who wish to disengage, to the extent possible, with the stress, lack of empathy, and ego-centric living presented by the dominant society.  We feel best when outdoors and sharing real living experiences with our community members.  While there is much to be sorrowful for, we are happy, vibrant, and have a strong positive outlook for our living here in the mountains of western Maine.  

Currently, there is the original solar-powered house where we do most of our social gathering, group meals, and food processing. The main house has two bedrooms; one, which will be occupied as of January 2018 by a couple and the other, which is currently vacant. Surrounding the main house is mostly forest and there are 2 occupied living structures (1 yurt and 1 cabin) and an additional 5 or 6 spaces where small living structures can be built. We will cluster our homes so they are close enough to not fragment the landscape but far enough to feel a sense of privacy as we adjust to communal living. We currently have a small cabin for people to come live in before they decide to build a structure of their own.</description>

      <name>Perth Ubuntu Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22992&quot;&gt;Perth Ubuntu Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; If it's not good for everyone, it's not good at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/perth-ubuntu-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/perth-ubuntu-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are at present a community of roughly ten individuals from various parts of Perth, Western Australia. We have meetings every week, but as yet have no location in which to start building a physical community. We are part of the worldwide Ubuntu movement, which you can Google, or watch numerous videos about on Youtube. Our goal is to create a world free of money. Money has enslaved the human race for 6,000 years, and we will never be truly free, until we are free of money. If we can get just one Ubuntu community up and running, this will show the world that we can not only live without money, but that we can live BETTER, without money. Once others see what is possible, it will start a domino effect, and other Ubuntu communities will form. In the startup phase of building the physical community where the first 1,000 of us will live, each member would contribute 3 hours a week to community projects, such as creating the gardens, energy and water systems that would form the basis of a community where we could live off the grid, in an ecologically sustainable manner. Putting in just 3 hours a week to start, would allow you to continue your job (if you have one) and other normal activities, until housing has been created at the community. In return for your 3 hours a week, you would receive food from the community garden. In Ubuntu, no one is paid in money: they are paid in food, water, electricity, accommodation, healthcare, and education... all of which would be made available as needed on a permanent basis, to those living in the community (once appropriate dwellings have been constructed). Those living in the community would be expected to work 3 hours a day on community projects, plus 3 hours a day on their Labour of Love. Your Labour of Love (LOL) is whatever you WANT to do, as long as it something that contributes to the community. It is called Ubuntu Contributionism, because everyone must CONTRIBUTE something - it could be anything, from gardening, to painting, to meditation classes, whatever you're passionate about - in order to receive the benefits. So, all in all, you're only working 6 hours a day, and it will be on whatever community projects (there will be a wide variety available) and LOL you CHOOSE to. The remaining 18 hours each day, you will be FREE to do whatever you wish, and you will be surrounded by people who love and support you, because the people you work alongside will be your friends and neighbours. Even your 'government' (the Tribal Elders) will be your friends and neighbours, who you can speak to at any time, to ensure that your interests will be taken care of.

If all this sounds good, I strongly recommend you watch the video: 'Ubuntu: A World Without Money' on Youtube. At only 15 minutes long, it's the perfect 'crash course' introduction to Ubuntu... and once you've watched that, you'll have a long play list of other Ubuntu videos to browse through, if you wish.

I'm keen to hear from anyone who has an interest in Ubuntu, even if all you can contribute is your presence and enthusiasm at the weekly community meetings... but I'm really hoping a wealthy investor or land owner will stumble across this. Although the ultimate goal is to create a community (and eventually, an entire world) without money, the sad, ironic reality, is that it will cost a great deal of money to build the thing in the first place. Money AND land - if you  have either, we're desperate to hear from you. Maybe you don't have much money, but you're a farmer with a decent-sized property, who'd like to be free of economic and government systems and their nonsensical, tyrannical rules. In  which case, you could give us some of your land (as much or as little as you like) to build our community - or a community garden - on. If we had an actual community on your land, you'd get free water, electricity and food (possibly also healthcare and education, if you needed them). If we had only a garden, obviously, you'd get a share of the crops to sell, in exchange for letting us use your land. You could be a full member of the community, or your arrangement with us could be similar to WWOOFING, but on a permanent basis. Contact me if interested, and we'll work something out.</description>

Our 'mother ship' is Canticle Farm, which is comprised of six adjacent houses with fences removed between 36th and Harrington Avenues. Inspired by the life of  Francis of Assisi and the Work That Reconnects as taught by Joanna Macy, Canticle Farm provides a platform for the Great Turning – the planetary shift from an industrial-growth society to a life-sustaining society – one heart, one home, and one block at a time. The Farm manifests a commitment to living and working towards more sustainable alternatives through spiritual practice, integral nonviolence, gift economy, restorative practices, urban permaculture, education and other work necessary for regenerating community in the 21st Century.
The neighborhood is largely Latino. Amor Art Farm and Manantial de Luz (formerly Casa de Paz) are just up the street. Our intention is that as we grow in number, we will house folks through renting/buying houses in the neighborhood.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/22998&quot;&gt;Order of Tiamat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; 1. Enable the individual to follow their true will in harmony in an alternative commune that provide them with social and financial support to help them reach this.

True Will is defined as the essential identity, passions, and motivations of an individual once they are stripped of cultural and social conditioning, mind-control, and the modern mindset and necessity to focus on materiality and survival at the cost of everything else.
In exchange for contribution to the development of the Order, individuals will be granted access to some of our resources to use to achieve their higher goals.
​
​2. Function as a sanctuary away from the unsavory aspects of the modern world, while maintaining connection with the more positive aspects so that the fruits of technological and scientific development can be harvested and that we continue to progress forward in all forms of evolution, rather than retreat into previous ways of being.
​
Among other pragmatic aspects of life, we aim at settling all of our willing members together in the same location so they may actualize themselves through social interaction, art,  intellectual work and other collective endeavors.
​​
3. Work to protect and preserve the natural conditions of existence of all living creatures on earth, and to ensure the preservation of the ecosystem for future generations. Contribute to the development of alternative technologies to improve our quality of life, and our knowledge of nature as part of the greater whole.

​4. Evolve as a center for the sacred where the transcendental center of every individual is activated so that all individuals experience the &quot;life that cuts through life&quot;.
​
Many understand the basic modalities of interacting with the world and oneself as feminine and masculine. In other words, they consist of love and will: receptivity to higher realities, and knowledge and skill to mold them. 

Magic practice and the perception of the &quot;sacred&quot; consist of the means, structures, and traditions of apprehending and interacting with a broader range of realities than are generally glimpsed by the uninitiated public. Through it, we can envision Source (the Divine) in its plane of existence, interact with higher dimensional beings in the ethereal plane, and produce thought-forms on the astral plane that will chisel the world around us to reflect our True Will.
​​​
5. Advocate for the rights of the seer, mystic, psychic. Educate the public about the esoteric and its proper place in social life.
​​
6. Create an interdisciplinary center of research for culture. An intellectual salon where important and heretical thinkers are studied with the purpose of achieving greater understanding and capacity for affecting change. A place for the consumption and creation of arts and philosophy that transcend time.

In light of the fragmentation of disciplines in modern academia, we represent an alternative to dissociated hyper-specialization in research. The subjective world, the world of spirit, has been neglected in pursuit of science and technology. The purpose of this center is to merge science, in all its advanced forms, and spirituality, by rigorous research to unravel disciplines that have barely been explored, including Integral Theory, psychoanalysis, and esoteric studies. We want to investigate myths and miracles to see what truly is possible, and to stretch the human to its full potential.
​
The methodology and goal of this center are to merge science and spirituality.
​​​
7. Enact meta-political and trans-historical social change to bring metaphysical revolution based around philosophical principles and a higher form of spiritual action.
​
​8. Restore spiritual sovereignty and ancient knowledge. Study and practice a variety of esoteric, shamanic and occult disciplines in great depth, with a combination of individual and group workings.

We combine witchcraft, shamanism, ceremonial magic, theurgy, neoplatonism, kaballism, Tantra, and other sometimes lost traditions with the goal of helping humanity transcend its limited condition and awareness, and broadening its connection to higher densities. 
​
​​9. Bring people together who've attained transpersonal levels of awareness. Help as many individuals achieve enlightenment/awakening as are ready.
​
The first truly transpersonal stage of awareness is stage 7 in Ken Wilber's terms, where limiting postmodern values such as pluralism, egalitarianism and hyper-individualism are replaced by a structure that favors a more nuanced understanding of self and development of hierarchy. To our knowledge, all existing public spiritual communities in the US are centered around the sixth stage of development or below.​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/order-of-tiamat/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/order-of-tiamat/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Order of Tiamat defines itself as a multidisciplinary spiritual community.
 
We are a growing group of eclectic individuals passionate about spirituality, real politics and exopolitics, holistic science and ancient knowledge, actively involved in both substantial and non-conventional change. We are in the process of creating a residential community which will serve as an alternative to the modern Western world: a crucible disconnected from the burdensome perspective that present-day civilization is heading for collapse and desperately trying to feed us with its own illusions and decadence --individual, social, economic, moral and environmental.
 
Countless alternative social projects like the Order of Tiamat are being spontaneously created and independent communities are emerging right now in many countries. However, our core values and ideals often deeply differ from the mainstream ones one can witness mostly everywhere nowadays.
 
Some of us are artists and thinkers, some seers, some scientists, visionaries or revolutionary activists, some
world travelers. We are looking for genuine, resolute, engaged souls who are willing to commit to a long-term collective project that demands mainly responsibility, insight, strength, relational skills and a fine taste in avant-garde production.
​
We are convinced that individual and isolated acts cannot change the upcoming global crisis the false elite of mankind is working for, and that the main responsibility of those who seek, like us, to embody and preserve what can be saved of earthly humanity's freedom, dignity, knowledge, tradition, and wisdom is to collectively prepare our transition from this age to the next.
​
Today, whenever you examine the different spiritual forces and beings trying to bring their contribution to the enlightenment of mankind, a constant and almost stunning reality appears: nearly all of them are profoundly isolated. If, for instance, you investigate the presence of shamans online and around you, most who are truly knowledgeable and devoted to the spiritual path for its own sake are separated from others pursuing the same goals. Although our enemies are partially responsible for this situation, it is also our own complacency, weakness and lack of faith that distance us from our responsibilities and power in this world.
 
This split results in every single person committed toward enlightenment having to exert an incredible amount of energy for minimal gain; if more unity were achieved, tremendous results could be accomplished almost effortlessly. Society as a whole works collectively with many roles delegated to execute a single purpose; yet those who wish to change the status quo tend to break off from others and to disregard the importance of collective action. humans have many different personality types, talents, and aptitudes, which serves to remind us that even if individuation is a mandatory yet often neglected aspect of spiritual growth, our final cause involves creatively merging with others to be more fulfilled, and successful. 
 
This perspective in mind, one of the central objectives of the Order of Tiamat is to move human cognition to a higher level of non-ego based self-realization fed, stimulated and encouraged in and by the pursuit of wisdom, justice, compassion, truth and constant enlightenment.  On a collective scale, we aim to accomplish this end through subversive inspired art, authentic activism, revolutionary spirituality, and transpersonal expressions of awareness.
 
Our influences, interests, sensibilities and sources of inspiration include both modern culture and ancient civilizations, Traditional forms of spirituality (neoplatonism, shamanism, traditional witchcraft), esoteric thinkers (such as Nietzsche, Evola, Lao Tzu, Plato, Steiner) and the ideals of the Ubermensch, Guardian and Warrior.
 
At this stage, it is still too early to precisely determine where we will establish ourselves, and all viable options - including outside the US - are being carefully considered. This being said, we are currently thinking of spanning a major city and its nearby rural location in either Washington State, Idaho or Montana.</description>

      <name>Housebus Helios and Lolin Farm Cohabitation</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23000&quot;&gt;Housebus Helios and Lolin Farm Cohabitation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We look toward building a better life for ourselves and the world by going back to simple living. We want to produce our own food or buy it locally, and we want to produce our own power as much as possible. We also look forward to helping found a sustainable community that positively impacts neighboring communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/housebus-helios/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/housebus-helios/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hi there, I'm Alys. I'm one of two members of Housebus Helios. We're parked with a budding intentional community (pop. 6 besides us) on a large organic ranch in Arlington, WA. Currently we're helping the owner of Lolin Farm and their community members build cabins with a central kitchen/shower/bath building. We're also clearing out a few spots for short-term camping areas and rebuilding walking forest trails. 

We rent a spot in the woods on the far side of forty acres, away from the central hub. While the two of us can do what we like on Helios and our small plot of land, the landower has the ultimate say with the rest of the community. 

Helios is a 2001 New Flier transit bus. We're renovating the inside and plan on having solar panels and a battery bank (right now we run a genny.) We've built a composting toilet in an outhouse and installed a woodburning stove for the nights when insulation isn't quite enough. We have plans for a drill well for fresh water so we won't have to haul it; luckily we're parked on a small creek and won't have to dig deep. The inside of the bus will be furnished with recycled wood, flooring, and other materials-- we spend a lot of time finding second-hand furniture and tools. 

Our family also includes two dogs, Mac and Trigger. They've adapted well to living on the bus; both have always loved riding in cars so there wasn't much adjustment to go through. They get as much time as possible running around the woods with us, hiking, and swimming. The landowner has several working dogs, including a rottweiler that herds her beefalo cattle. There's also a flock of chickens for eggs and meat.

The land itself has glacial creeks running through it, an apple orchard, tons of wild mint, a plot of raspberries and natural blackberries and salmon berries. Whatever food we don't get from the land is available locally and often just down the street. 

We spent the summer living on various campgrounds but none of them had offered what we'd been looking for-- a diverse community that we can be a part of long-term and that has the same goal that we do towards a living sustainable lifestyle within nature. By lucky chance Lolin Farm found us and it is more awesome than we imagined. It's not huge, but forty acres of paradise is enough.</description>

However, we believe that cities are transformed through transformed people; people with a common cause, mission and commitment. Our residency is aimed at creating an environment where residents experience personal growth and develop into leaders who are agents of change in urban centers across the United States.

Our Approach::
 SERVE::
–  Residents will work full-time for Triple Threat Mentoring at one of its 
two locations (Aurora, IL or Santa Ana, CA)
–  Serve together. Residents will work together to come up with ways to serve 
their neighbors and community, and then they will actually do it! This will 
happen once a month.
LIVE::
–  Live intentionally with 4-5 residents for 3, 6, 12, or 24 month terms.
–  Hang together and schedule a time each month to simply have fun.
–  Eat together. Residents will share one meal together during the week to 
check-in, review the house calendar, develop plans for serving their 
neighbors and resolve any conflict.
GROW::
–  Meet regularly with a mentor for personal and professional growth. 
Mentors are leaders in their community that have a passion for investing in the lives of others. Residents will meet with their mentors regularly (at least bi-weekly) for around an hour. Mentors primary aim is to simply come along side the residents and help them get where they desire to go.
–  Bi-Monthly Resident/Mentor HANG. It might be dinner, a movie, or a ballgame. The only rule is that it has to be fun!
–  Bi-monthly Resident/Mentor DEVELOP to hear from a guest speaker who will share on a pertinent topic with the residents and then facilitate discussion.
–  Retreat. The Residency will kick off with a retreat and culminate with a capstone retreat at the end.

We currently live on a 26-acre off the grid permaculture homestead producing beef, dairy, eggs, poultry, vegetables, fruits, nuts, medicine and wood for heat.  The neighbor's land is 52 acres, mostly fallow pasture, a gorgeous year-round creek, old furnished farmhouse, well, outbuildings, sun deck and glassed-in porch with wood and oil heat.  We are seeking a family, couple or cohesive co-housing group (&quot;Farming Partners&quot;) to live in our neighbor's house and partner in farming one or both properties with us depending on interests and experience.  The Farming Partners would be expected to pay utilities on the farmhouse ($200/mo, approx), provide maintenance and some repairs on house, and share house with owner who is only present 20-30 days per year.  Farming Partners could develop their own farm venture or partner with us in row-cropping, dairy and meat production toward self sufficiency, or develop a permaculture perennial herb farm at our property.  This could become an affordable for-profit farming venture for experienced farmers or a turn-key opportunity for rookies to leave the rat-race and farm a rural property under the guidance of two experienced off-grid, permaculture farmers (30+ combined years farming).  We intend to have close community relations with Farming Partners as land and infrastructure on both properties would be shared, and ideally, meals, equipment, childcare, transportation to town etc. would be shared also.</description>

The Eco-Community will provide a socio-cultural support structure as well as a healthy atmosphere for living and working. For community members, fair work, cooperation, and an abundance mentality replace the materialism, competition and scarcity mentality prevalent in today's world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/8thlife-panama-ecovillage-collaborative-work-life-initiative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/8thlife-panama-ecovillage-collaborative-work-life-initiative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;*SEEKING CO-FOUNDERS* 
A collaborative work-life initiative forming an intentional community in rural Panama based on permaculture ethics, respect, peace &amp;amp; living an “on-purpose” life.

THE PROJECT – Come create community. 8th Life Panama is a permaculture-based Eco-village Project in the early stages of formation. We’re designing our intentional community to provide a social support structure and a low impact lifestyle for our members, residents, volunteers and guests. We envision an intentional rural community where the values and ideals of community, respect, peace, and living an “on-purpose” life will be rediscovered by the diverse, multigenerational group of people who’ve joined us. We are currently seeking founding members and experienced permaculture volunteers.

THE REASONS – We can live more lightly. As human beings we weren’t designed to live disconnected from nature and each other. As a society we’ve gone astray and as a result we’re damaging our mother earth and soon she won’t be able to sustain human life. We seem to have also lost the ability to relate with one another as human beings. It’s time to transition from a destructive society to a sustainable world. We need to stop the destruction, build soil, restore ecosystems, heal our addictions, change organizational structures of the global economy, &amp;amp; learn to live in community.

THE LAND – Be a steward and protector. Our Eco-village land, Finca Astoria, is 21Ha of grasslands and forests bordered by a river and stream. When we bought the land, it was in its natural state apart from 1Ha that’s been farmed on occasion. The finca is located 11 km from the town of Antón Panama, where we have our operations center. Villa Astoria is our co-working, co-living center in the town of Antón. It is an operational guest house, receiving travelers, digital nomads and volunteers and other project participants. We work and live here while designing the Eco-village.

The Initiative has two physical components, Villa Astoria Guest House - the operations center, &amp;amp; Finca Astoria - 21Ha of land for developing the EcoVillage. We envision incorporating a number of elements such as:

    *intentional community eco-village based on integral permaculture design principles (on Finca Astoria)
    *eco-enterprise incubator, shared workspace for eco-community members &amp;amp; volunteers (at Villa Astoria)
    *artisan &amp;amp; craftspeople's incubator, shared workspace, &amp;amp; storefront for eco-community members and local residents
    *promoting and strengthening the local economy of our neighborhood and the town through example
    *training/workshops in eco-economics, the circular economy, 'buy local', and local economic development
    *community gardens and local produce and artisan markets
    *permaculture courses and other practical, hands-on learning experiences such as eco-building</description>

It is a project with many options and many layers. It is scalable between one ecological farm only to a complete rural EcoGay village. It works for creating an online community, which in turn also means it can easily be duplicated in other places as well. The main thing is that we need to connect first to make things happen.

We want to get in touch with gay men who agree that people need to treat our planet with respect. That we need biodiversity and natural function at the center of our thinking. EcoGay is modelled after ecosystems and aims to build resilience by focussing on people in all their functions and abilities, guided by cooperation rather than competition.</description>

The group generally follow a low carb, high protein (LCHP) approach to normalizing blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/healthy-t1d/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/healthy-t1d/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a group of families and individuals who follow Dr. Bernstein's dietary guidelines for achieving normal blood sugars even with impaired or absent pancreatic function. While this group is primarily focused on people with type one diabetes, it is open to family, friends, and those with type two diabetes who are also following Dr. Bernstein's methods. 

Individual members and families live in their own homes, although some may choose to live in shared housing if desired. Everyone in the community recognizes the challenges that we go through to act as an external pancreas for ourselves or our loved ones. We offer emotional support and a wealth of communal knowledge to each other in times of need, such as during illness, stress, growth spurts, unusual exercise patterns, and other challenges of management.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23028&quot;&gt;Laughing Frog Gardens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are motivated by multi-generational cooperative living, openness and curiosity, and ecological sustainability.  We are interested in folks joining us who like hard work, like to see projects through, and are responsible and self-motivated, with a primary interest in cooperative gardening and the possibility of shared business.  We are hoping to meet people who want open and kind communication with mutual respect for others and the shared spaces and this land, and who have love and motivation for sharing work and building together, and a joy in seeing each other's individual growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/laughing-frog-gardens/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/laughing-frog-gardens/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We live on 32 acres of wooded land in central Missouri, 30 minutes north of Columbia. Columbia is a vibrant college town with lots of opportunity for cultural activity and education.

For the past eight years we have developed organic permaculture/forest/kitchen gardens that have supplied about 90 percent of our fruits and vegetables for 2 people. They are rich in native and cultivated annuals, perennials, fruiting shrubs and trees. We also have chickens for our eggs.  Our intention has been to foster a healthy ecosystem of plants, insects, and animals as a model of small scale integrated sustainable agriculture.  

Currently we have a small business on Etsy making rag rug looms, but would love to develop more cottage industry that can support a household through income sharing. Some other things we have done from the land is sustainable education and small farmer's market sales. 

 There are 3 lots, 2 of them could be built on, with purchasing as an option, or used to extend agricultural needs, and sleeping cottages could be built.  For now, new people would need to camp or otherwise provide their own shelter, and their own food.   The best fit would be folks who are passionate gardeners, the gardens and chickens managed cooperatively.

Though the house is a conventional house, we heat with responsibly selected wood and retrofitting is a possibility depending on the financial structure that the community sets up.</description>

Sharing our skills and experiences, learning from one another, respecting and appreciating our differences, finding our gifts and talents and using them to help the community.
(In a nutshell)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-old-home-place-apiary/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-old-home-place-apiary/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I've been wanting to do something like this for years..not that I don't enjoy healthy solitude and silent time..on the contrary.  And I have amazing friends from all walks of life and fortunate to have family, close.  However, living in the country and trying to  homestead a little here and there and seeing so many amazing projects in prepping, survival, bushcraft, beekeeping, gardening, etc. I've come to the conclusion I need a villiage.  Most are settled in their homes and lives and have no need to travel or seek housing.  They are already living their dream or seriously pursuing it.  But if you're like me, you're still figuring it out.  Last year, my best friend and I started this journey.  He was just going to build me a little chicken coop which turned into a chicken house, then two.  Together, we acquired guineas, a rooster, chickens, and bees.  He loved being the maintenance man, every repair he could make, he did.  We worked side by side steadily from March 2016 until October 2016 when he fell ill.  March 2017 he was diagnosed with cancer.  Though his heart is still in it, he simply cannot continue working, though he probably won't stop.  He has this great airliner camper.  He's going to hang out here and boss me around lol.  I have focused on the bees.  It's the best hobby I could have.  It's good for the soul, along with gardening and any outside work.    I spend a lot of my time reading and learning what I can about bee biology and the art of beekeeping.  This is my 2nd year and I have been so fortunate.  I hope to expand my bee yard even more, next spring.  I've made several splits, sold some, gifted some, kept some.  It looks like I will be going into the winter with 7 hives.  I harvested more honey than I expected and even rendered my first beeswax from all the wax cappings.    We accomplished so much and had plans for so much more, here on the hill.  It's nice and quiet here.  Except for the guineas and a rooster.  There's a creek that runs through the property, a lot of wooded areas, valleys, hills.  I've got one of the best views of the sunrise and sunset.  Seven miles from town, however, you're within an hour drive from Tulsa, Fayetteville, Bentonville, and Eureka Springs.  Many artist and musicians live in the area.  I love my hometown and this is my grandfather's land.  He was an ole timer who loved the simple country life.  It takes years to accomplish all that he did.  But together, we had a modest garden, fresh eggs, and what I thought would be the start of a little homestead.  There are a lot of wooded areas here on the hill and I love the art of bushcrafting.  Not that I'm good at it, but I want to learn many survival skills, along with that. I would love to see someone or group skilled in bushcrafting come and build primitive camping spots, teaching the art.  I'm also looking for individuals who love music and art, love to garden, skilled in herbal medicine, experienced in animal husbandry, butchering,carpentry, homemaking, organizing/starting up small communities, retired beekeepers, active beekeepers, creative and kind people who would enjoy working with others to achieve common goals; safe, clean, peaceful and recreational place to live, clean local food to eat, like-minded people to share in the work and the fruits of our labor.  I think there are a lot of people like me that have come to the realization, &quot;It takes a village.&quot;  I am willing to open my home and share my land with those who are willing to share my vision.  If this sounds like something you're interested in, this may be the &quot;village&quot; you're looking for.  Perhaps you're not experienced or super skilled in these particular areas but you are an amazing person and have something to offer and want to be a part of this kind of community, your gift will make room for you.  One of my closest friends and her 2 are coming at the end of September.  She is going to school for parks and recreation management (or something like that) and this girl can do amazing things with wood.  She's super motivated, organized, and hard-working.  I don't know what this &quot;community&quot; will look like in 6 mos - a year but I'm optimistic about the possibilities.</description>

We seek to build a sustainable income sharing model based on providing logistical support to the wildland fire and incident response communities.  We also desire to reduce our dependence on the mainstream culture through growing &amp;amp; raising a substantial portion of our own food, implementing rotational grazing, water conservation and reducing our carbon footprint. We will strive to become better ecological stewards. Through labor sharing efforts, we intend to strengthen our bonds with other local intentional communities. 

We are focused on the big picture of working nationally to sustain our forests, watersheds, clean air and our environment for current and future generations through providing much needed logistical support services to the wildland fire and incident response communities. What better way to truly make an impact on the environment than to serve the men and woman who everyday risk their lives to protect and care for our natural resources.</description>

My expereieces have taught me that we need to honour our unique planet Earth - Gaia for she is far more than we know .  For we are unaware of her true nature and purpose which is in alignment with our evolution and purpose in being 'on earth'.
This is why I started Awakening Community in 2014 and now am opening it to new members. There is so much abundance here - mature walnut, hazel, apple,quince and plum trees all producing. I have recently planted cherry almond peach and apricot and a kiwi and grape vine.  Awakening community is blessed with abundance in the wild - cherry plums,crab apples,cornilean cherry called dryan here in Bulgaria,rosehips, hawthorn berries,. There are also many herbs growing here in the mountains various thymes mints, oregano,lemon balm,chickory,dandylion. 

My book Awakening - The Inevitable Door , to be published early next year discusses and explores the interconnection of ourselves, Gaia  and all life. and shares my experiences  , much more.. 

 My second book Awakening to Gaia reveals our ancient  ability to live a life in co operation and co creation with the spiritual essence of Gaia.  This journey of awakening to our latent dormant abilities is one of remembering and relearning .and weather we are aware or not we have a role and place to for fill in partnership with Gaia .</description>

We are a family of five humans working to build a human-scale community and living laboratory.

What is a human-scale community?
In a world in which globalization, industrialization, and large-scale thinking is the norm, our interests lie in fostering the development of hyper-local, small-scale thinking and living.
Our vision of a human-scale community is one that values, first and foremost the well-being of the humans within the community. This includes – perhaps most significantly – the well-being of the children within the community.
Well-being, as we understand it, is a multifaceted phenomenon. It consists not only of physical health, but also of a sense of belonging, a sense of purpose, and the support and nurturing of fellow humans. It means access to clean water, clean air, a pleasant and safe environment, and nourishing food. It means a safe place to learn and grow for children and adults alike.
Moreover, we do not believe that well-being can exist without consideration of the larger context in which humans exist. That is, though we believe that human-to-human interactions and communication is essential to individual well-being, that is not the whole of it. Also, it is crucial that each of us is given the opportunity to form a connection to the place where we live – the land, the wild animals, etc. We must come to know and respect the needs of the non-humans around us in order to preserve and protect the balance that supports our human needs such as clean water, clean air, healthy soil, beautiful views, and beautiful sounds.
In light of this, we believe that a human-scale community is one that prioritizes daily human-to-human communication and connection, the needs of all members of the community, and the needs of the non-human plants and animals who live in symbiosis with the humans in the community.
Although human-scale community may take many different forms, there are some underlying principals which provide some clear guidelines on what is and is not included in a human-scale community when it comes to things such as food production, the construction of buildings, and the ways in which the humans within the community interact.
Food Production
Our vision for community involves hyper-local food production. Our aspiration is to produce as close to one hundred percent of our food as possible.
This aspiration is not a rigid rule. We do not dictate that any member of the community must produce all their own food. Nor are we presently equipped to achieve that goal for ourselves within the next five years.
However, our view and experience is that having a connection with our food through its production also helps to generate many other benefits within a human-scale community. It connects us with the land and wildlife, the natural cycles, the needs of our non-human neighbors. It connects us with one another as humans because it places upon us the need to clearly communicate with one another and work cooperatively. And it helps us feel a sense of purpose since food is one of our primary needs as humans.
Within a human-scale community, food production should aspire to use as little inputs from outside the land as possible. Our vision is that, at a minimum, we wish to use no chemical inputs.

Building Construction:

Today, the norm for construction is to use manufactured lumber, adhesives, foams, and so forth, which are made in part or entirely from chemicals and in factories. Meanwhile, they are transported, often hundreds or thousands of miles – sometimes across large oceans.
Furthermore, the norm for new houses continues to be to build large dwellings.
That style of construction – while it has its advantages – is not compatible with human-scale community.
Our vision for building construction is to build houses and outbuildings by hand, using local, natural materials.
In this case, “by hand” is a loose concept open to some interpretation by the members of the community. It does not exclude using milled lumber of timbers, nails manufactured in factories, etc. But it does emphasize the value that is at play – that building within the community should be something in which our primary value of the well-being of the humans in the community is preserved. 
Therefore, rather than attempting to build with haste, our vision is to build with the long-term needs of the human and non-human needs in mind. We seek to ask questions such as “What will be the impact of this decision 50 years from now?” and “Does this decision lead to greater connection with one another and the land?”
We are particularly interested in cob as a building material. Cob is made from clay, sand, and fibrous plant material (such as straw) – all of which are generally available on one’s own land. Cob can produce strong, resilient structures that can last hundreds or thousands of years. Though cob does not have a high insulative value, it does provide thermal mass, meaning that it can help to reduce the amount of wood needed to heat a space.

Human Interactions:

We believe that daily, meaningful, substantial human-to-human interaction is necessary for our well-being. And we believe that also requires daily interaction with those outside of our nuclear families.
Our vision for community is that all members of the community are afforded many opportunities to come together daily. None of these are forced – each individual is free to choose which opportunities to take advantage of. However, we envision a community in which members are interested in taking advantage of many such opportunities.
These opportunities could include, but are not limited to meals, building projects, shared businesses, maintenance projects, firewood production, animal care, and gardening.
Additionally, we envision regular community meetings to ensure that all members stay up to date with the goings-on of others within the community as well as the community at large. Some, but not all, of these meetings will be community business meetings to discuss the business of the community.

Children:

We have three children, and children are currently central to our lives. Our vision for community is one that emphasizes the needs of the children within it.
Our belief is that children thrive when they have the right to exercise self-direction in play. We believe that a child’s work is play – that play is how children learn and grow. And we believe that children must be given the space to direct their own play.
Children – like all humans – have conflicts. We believe that it is healthy and correct to allow children the space to attempt to resolve their conflicts on their own if they wish to do so. We will intervene if we believe that safety is compromised or in the rare case in which we believe that the level of the conflict is simply beyond what the child or children can be reasonably expected to be able to resolve.
Our vision for community is that all of its children members are allowed to play freely with a level of adult supervision appropriate to the ages of the children and without excessive intervention.
We also envision a community in which children are heard – where the adults make genuine efforts to hear what the children are attempting to communicate. We believe that children are inherently social beings. However, they are not typically skilled in communicating their social needs in ways that adults easily understand. Therefore, we believe that we can foster their social development by taking the time to truly listen.

Social Sustainability:

Our vision is that the members of the community prioritize building a hyperlocal community within walking distance.
Today it is the norm for both children and adults to meet their social needs often through extensive car travel. While we believe that there are many benefits to having a wide social network, we also feel that having hyper-local social outlets readily available offers important benefits most of us are missing.
To that end, we wish to build a community in which no one must travel by car in order to meet their social needs. We envision a community in which the norm is for children members to play together daily and adult members to socialize daily – all within walking distance.

Money:

Our vision is that each adult member or family of the community maintains their own separate finances. Members buy in to the community with a one-time fee. Members also contribute on a schedule to a community fund to pay for property taxes, maintenance fees, and other community costs.

Decision Making:

Our vision is to maintain community-wide values of respect, honesty, vulnerability and clarity in our communication process, and with those values in mind, to make our community decisions through a form of consensus. A consensus-based decision-making process would foster a cohesive fluidity in the long-term growth and evolution of our community. Consensus produces a feeling of equality and collaboration, and although decisions may be more time-consuming to conclude when compared to a majority-rules voting style, the implementation of those decisions would be quicker and smoother within the community due to the wholehearted support of each member.  

Growth &amp;amp; New Members:

We envision our community growing in a way which can be sustainably supported by our communal land. At this time, we estimate that fertile land could support one family per 10 acres, not including wetland acreage. Prospective members would complete a membership process, including a trial year, before becoming full members of the community.

Living Laboratory:

Our vision is that the community will house a living laboratory that will be open to the public to share what we learn about human-scale community, sustainability and simple living skills.
The laboratory will take form as publications (newsletters, books, etc.,) workshops and retreats. Ideas for workshop and retreat topics include, but are not limited to: handmade house construction, cob oven building, keeping goats naturally in New England, beekeeping, rainwater harvesting, decision-making in community, and herbalism.</description>

There are a variety of residential units, school and university buildings and buildings for hydropondic gardens and dairy, all constructed of fire and earthquake resistant concrete. The buildings are all of the monolithic dome design, which is both energy efficient and the strongest structure known. 

Each residential unit is constructed of concrete with embedded fine mesh metal screen wire to form a Faraday Cage. Inside there is a Satyug Sanctuary Pyramid for each person or couple, and a Goloka Projector for perfect Vastu. There are units to accommodate from one person to entire families.

Each Goloka Sanctuary Community is fully sustainable and self-sufficient - everything for a comfortable lifestyle is included in the community, including organic hydropondic gardens and an ahimsa dairy. Each community has a MahaVideha University Campus and a MahaVideha School, plus a Sri Vyuha Ashram.

Every adult has some light duties to perform for the management, maintenance, and security of the community. The children enjoy the finest education in the MahaVideha School. Every adult is encouraged to attend courses at the MahaVideha University Campus and earn their Doctor of Divinity degree during their stay. Then enjoy life in the Bliss of Krishna Consciousness in the Sri Vyuha Ashram.

Everyone in the community is enrolled in the Satyug Kaya Kalpa Program to create their Satyug Physiology for the coming Krishna Golden Age. Everyone has a Maha Yajña Vitara so the individual and the entire community is Invincible.

These Goloka Sanctuary Communities are our way of surviving the effects of the pralaya so we can thrive in the new Krishna Golden Age. Please read our book that describes this in detail: www.returningtogoloka.com.

Ansatz is a German word meaning the &quot;initial placement of a tool at a workpiece.&quot;
In relation to our community, it represents the idea that many young people have incredible dreams and goals, but sometimes we need help getting started. The purpose of this community is to unite young, intelligent, artistic, trailblazing individuals who are interested in supporting one another. We are particularly interested in creative types, charitable individuals, progressive thinkers, young liberals, those interested in sustainability and the environment, and those interested in human spirituality and sexuality. 
Our goal is to organize a small community of 5-10 wonderful friends who love each other and love working together. My plan is to purchase a multi-family townhouse in Brooklyn as a home for the community. Members must be able to pay modest rent in Brooklyn, and will be expected to contribute time towards organizing community events, participating in philanthropy/volunteering, taking care of the property, and attending group meetings. The idea is to solidify a constitution, leadership positions, and structure over the next two years until our property is purchased.</description>

We focus on intersectional social and environmental justice of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/still-learning-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/still-learning-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Community-focused residents &amp;amp; friends working together in mutual aid. The house (which we're always working to improve in wheelchair-accessibility &amp;amp; environmental friendliness) is located on road with a bus route, bike lanes, and accessible sidewalks; less than 2 miles from downtown and less than half a mile from a variety of parks &amp;amp; wooded areas (both dirt-path &amp;amp; paved).
We are in the continuous process of finding ways to better include residents/friends/visitors of marginalized identities. These involves many efforts including promoting use &amp;amp; learning of American Sign Language; using only nontoxic products; and cultivating a culture around consent, accountability, cultural sensitivity, and open communication.
There is currently a cat in residence, and plans for foster children in coming years.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23054&quot;&gt;Merkaba Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We don't enforce many 'rules' here, but we do assume a certain level of consciousness and we live by a few core principles which allow us to thrive as a community. Whether visiting, living or working within the community, you agree to adhere to these practises whilst here... 

&amp;gt; Concept of Abundance – if every person in the community gave more than they took, we would all have an abundance of everything we ever need...  

&amp;gt; Mindfulness – we are mindful in all activities throughout our day, whether this be practising yoga, eating, interacting with another person or carrying out our daily chores... this includes awareness of and accountability for our own thoughts, words and actions... 

&amp;gt; Respect for Mother Nature – we keep various animals on the land (3 dogs, 4 cats, 12 chickens, 1 cockerel, 6 ducks &amp;amp; geese) and display unconditional love, compassion and respect for all sentient beings...

&amp;gt; Oneness – we operate as one big family, always endeavouring to help and support each other, finding ways to compromise, engaging in open, conscious communication and resolving any disagreements peacefully... 

&amp;gt; Spiritual Practise – we believe that the foundation of a community is built on individual and group spiritual practise and we endeavour to raise our vibration each day, in whatever way, shape or form that may take... 

&amp;gt; Waste Management – we are mindful of all forms of waste in our endeavour to be fully sustainable. We either recycle or find ways to upcycle in other areas of the community. With this in mind, please try to bring as little plastic to the community as possible. This also applies to food (cooking and eating) where we try to operate a zero waste policy. 

General Information  
We eat a predominantly vegan diet, with the exception of the eggs from our chickens which are fed an organic, non-GMO diet. We grow some fruit and vegetables, but whilst we are developing our land to increase farming capacity, we also buy fresh, seasonal produce from a local organic farmer. We also purchase nuts, seeds, grains and superfood supplements from an organic wholesaler. 

We are fully solar-powered, collect rain water and pump water from a borehole in the ground. Therefore we have to limit our power and water usage accordingly. We do have a washing machine but this is for bedding and towels only so please do not use for personal laundry. 

There is a high risk of fire in this and surrounding areas due to the hot, dry environment. We do permit smoking but please respect allocated smoking areas and make note of fire safety procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/merkaba-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/merkaba-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are an off-grid eco-community nestled in the Portuguese Gardunhia mountain range near Fundão, set in beautiful, wild nature. Our community is a haven for spiritual seekers, health enthusiasts, artists, adventurers, and anyone who wants to explore the healthy way of living needed for a new paradigm. Every day is different at Merkaba. We are always growing, always having fun, and our focus is always on sustainability, great health and spiritual development. We live on fresh, nutritious food, either grown ourselves or sourced locally, along with fresh well water as we continue to expand this space.
Our community consists of two Geodesic domes, a double decker bus converted into a fully functional house, an outdoor gym, an infinity yoga deck and during 2018 we plan to add a pool, sauna and our very first eco home built almost entirely out of waste. For those seeking to go within there are lots of spaces around the site to chill out and meditate and for those seeking an external adventure we have a plethora of local activities to suit everyone.

We’re doing all we can to live in harmony with Mother Nature and each other, and paving the path for a sustainable future. At Merkaba we aim to provide an open, supportive space for authentic self-expression and expansion and have a positive social &amp;amp; ecological impact on the world through empowering people to live in a more sustainable way.</description>

This is a non-traditional opportunity so we have a non-traditional recruitment process.We are not looking for people to fill defined roles at Malamaki. We are looking for people who are answering their own calling (life purpose) and need a context in which to do so. If that is you, please respond to the following questions. Take great care with your response. If we take you on, your response to these questions will be the cornerstone of your contract with us. If you tell us what you think we want to hear, you are setting yourself up for certain failure. Also, you haven’t a clue as to what we “want to hear”.

1. What do you intend to do with the rest of your life?

2. WHY?     (That’s the key question)

3. Please describe the (functional) steps you perceive as fundamental to achieving your intentions.

Simply tell the truth and tell the truth simply. We are not looking for eloquence, just clarity of purpose. If we are in a position to facilitate your objectives, we will respond. If you are not yet absolutely clear what you are up to, please save us all a lot of time and heartache. This opportunity would not work out for you.

P.S. We would also love to peruse your resume.</description>

      <name>The Nettle Bed</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23060&quot;&gt;The Nettle Bed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Queers learn to farm in community!&quot; We're queer and trans folks + allies who care about justice and relationships, learning urban gardening and homesteading, connected to a rural queer land project and farm in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-nettle-bed/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-nettle-bed/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The idea for a queer- and trans- centered urban homestead began when the two queer farmers of Racing Heart Farm reached out to build more community around their duplex in the city. When they finally &quot;bought the farm&quot; in 2017 and moved out to the country to begin their queer land project, Heartland, three people moved into the top floor of the city house to form The Nettle Bed. Named for the medicinal wild plant being cultivated in our backyard, we hope this space will be one of nourishment, safety, resistance, and roots.    

Our home is located on a bustling corner of the Phillips / Ventura Village neighborhood, a primarily working-class and POC neighborhood, and the historic birthplace of the American Indian Movement. The neighborhood is home to an active Islamic Center, American Indian Center, Waite House Community Center, indigenous art gallery, library, and several community gardens. We're also just blocks down the street from the Wildflower Worker and Rye House / Minneapolis Catholic Worker communities.

Daily Life and Dreams: We engage in community with our downstairs neighbors via weekly dinners and collaboration on some gardening and yard projects. The Nettle Bed has a large, fenced-in extra-large lot with raised garden beds, grass mowed by grazing rabbits, young apple and chokecherry trees, berry bushes, medicinal plants, rain barrels, and fire pit. None of us are experts at growing things, but we are learning as we go and hope to continue to incorporate permaculture design as we develop the yard. (Mushrooms? Chickens?) We enjoy gathering people for events that range from tender and reflective to joyfully rowdy, so far including: backyard concerts, Solstice bonfires, song circles, game nights, and weekly meals. Our downstairs neighbors have also hosted documentary nights and speakers about local organizing efforts. We seek to question mainstream American culture by living simply; talk about race, class, and gentrification; support each other in learning and unlearning; establish seasonal and yearly traditions; do things outside the house together (attend performances and actions, participate in neighborhood events, go camping, visit the farm); and build an extended community of warm, close relationships. 

Opportunities out at the farm include: Helping on vegetable operation- big harvests, weeding, transplanting, processing (drying, fermenting, canning, freezing, cidering), Building projects (deck, dance floor, earthen oven, composting toilet, sauna, outdoor kitchen, cabin), Hosting workshops / skill shares, Creating an artist retreat/residency, Learning about chickens and sheep, Wild crafting/foraging, or starting a small business that requires a little land in the country (eg beekeeping).</description>

      <name>La Smala</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23062&quot;&gt;La Smala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The purpose of la Smala is to facilitate the development of projects aimed at reducing the ecological footprint. For this purpose, it undertakes initiatives offering alternatives to overconsumption and overproduction.
In particular, it organizes the management of &quot;vacant&quot; houses, on a provisional basis, within the framework of contracts known as &quot;loans for use&quot;, and periodic meetings of reflection on the topic of degrowth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/la-smala/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/la-smala/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Since 1993, Smala institute develops experience/expertise in socio-environmental entrepreneurship and eco-community building, a kind of living lab. It provides training, coaching and hosting for over 1’800 beneficiaries from 1993 to 2017, out of which ¼ are social entrepreneurs, and 3/4 are artists, families, students, seniors and unemployed.

Smala has managed over 40 co-housing spaces with intergenerational and creative “hives”. We started in the industrial district of Lausanne “le Flon”, contributing in revitalizing it as a new source of creativity, a little Soho. Thanks to the socio-economic success encountered with this first initiative, Smala received from the public and private partners new opportunities to develop similar “living laboratories” in other locations.

Ever since 1995, Smala team has tackled the challenge of incubating 40 short and mid-term hives, eco-life learning centres, with 5 to 30 cohabitants and co-workers in each location, in the Lausanne area. These temporary hives had a duration of 1 to 10 years, and have been developed in partnership and/or supported by local and federal administrations for housing, social services, culture, academic research, adult training, NGOs and sociocultural centres.

These activities have made Smala institute resilient to societal changes and demonstrated its ability to manage complex governance situations.

Since 2013, Smala moved to a new step in starting the development of long-term communities, on rural lands with cooperative ownership. While searching for international references to compare Smala’s innovative methods with other initiatives, Smala experts have identified the Global Ecovillage Network (GEN) as one of the most efficient knowledge alliances for social entrepreneurship learning; Smala is now a member of GEN-Europe.

Smala experts have included a special focus and expertise on transversal/soft skills building and fair trade culture within community building, both aspects being considered as key complements to vocational skills for active citizenship and right livelihood.

Smala’s leading team is composed of pioneers of change who contributed significantly in the transition of this industrial district and/or other socially innovative places and enterprises.

By moving so many times our headquarters and healing various new places, Our team has developed a replicable art of co-living and co-working, using informal “learning while doing” methods. It became a fair set of rules of functioning (governance) that we updated at each new community project, becoming the Ecopol label after 20 years of experience. 

2014-2018: Smala builds ecovillages!

After incubating the Bâtir Groupé cooperative from 2006 to 2013, we bought a land in Cheiry and then in Grandvaux. We built both houses and human relationships. Smala officially becomes a member of GEN-Europe, the ecovillage network (2013). Then, the successes followed. We inaugurated Cheiry on the 21st of August 2016, and then the ecovillage « Berber » in Grandvaux the 25th of Novembre 2017. Smala is a small federation of communities which born in Romandie. We favour social ecology on the basis of the Ecopol social contract, beyond the pre-requisites already well established in the Swiss culture, such as energy-efficiency, affordable rents in co-operative and infrastructure sharing (laundry, vegetable gardens, party room, carpool, etc.).

We organized more than 150 conferences and sharing evenings on the art of living together between 2013 and 2018. Our Ecopol service is now consulted by dozens of eco-project holders, each with their own sensibilities, and we have studied dozens of projects to help others develop their vision of eco-housing.

We are celebrating our 25th anniversary on September 8, 2018, in our new Transition Training Center, Berber House, in the heart of the magnificent Lavaux UNESCO Heritage.</description>

We are seeking other awakened beings of light, who possess a trade-able skill or two (Such as Massage, Reiki, Yoga, Tai Chi, Chi Gong, Meditation, Mindfulness, Aikido, Permaculture Design, Herbalism, or any other like-minded practice), LGBTQ friendly (allies welcome), and 420 friendly humans and their fur babies, who are looking for their place in the world to sustain a livelihood and home in one place. We believe by connecting like-minded collaborative humans to create this Intentional Community, we can keep the costs down to $700 per person (or less).

We are looking to create a collaborative living situation that feeds us individually and collectively, for our body-minds &amp;amp; spirits, through shared community responsibilities to maintain our group home in love and light. Many of us have been called to create something like this. If this community speaks to your heart, and you are ready to try something new, please contact us today.

If you have lived in an Intentional Community previously, we are interested in interviewing you to help us with this new Intentional Community Development. Please send me a message or post here and we'll reach out to you.

If you own a large piece of property in the Ojai, Moorpark, Simi Valley, Chatsworth, Granada Hills, Westlake Village or Thousand Oaks area, and you have been called by spirit to share it in some way with your community, you will know when you meet us if this is the right choice. Please contact us with more info about your space.

The original partners and perspective partners are no longer interested in the project, so I am searching for new members. The community will own 83 acres of mostly arable land that will be rented to members and non-members with priority given to members. Originally we decided to build a new house with a shared space and private living modules. Construction has not begun yet, so any new members would have influence on the design and operation of the living arrangement. I hope to eventually convert the current house into a restaurant and/or bakery that primarily uses product grown on site. The owner of the property will pay for the construction of the new house, and members will buy into the community. Financing may be available for anyone who can't afford the initial investment.</description>

The name Clear Sky represents the mind of blissful, non-clinging awareness – the still, clear mind always present behind the ever-shifting clouds of everyday thoughts and emotions. This is the mind that pays attention to the right details and is alert, awake, conscious, and kind.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23087&quot;&gt;White Lake Intentional Christian Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We aim to live sustainably (consuming less, sharing items, growing food, living small) together (sharing a property with family units) while honoring Christ (involving community spiritual rhythms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/white-lake-intentional-christian-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/white-lake-intentional-christian-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Inspired by the community living and sustainable practices from our internship and work at A Rocha Canada, a Christian conservation organization, we purchased roughly three acres on land in White Lake, BC, Canada.  This land is 25 minutes away from Salmon Arm affording easy access to amenities, but is unzoned so we are legally capable of building as many dwellings as needed for our community.  What started as raw land in 2017 now has (almost!) three dwelling units in housed in two dwellings. We are currently living in the cabin on site as a family of four and hope that roughly in May 2018 either two family units (a couple, a family, friends living together as family, etc.) or one family unit and some interns will join us.  We are in the process of looking for people to join us who ideally will want to form long-term community with us.  We are very open to people being creative about how to form community on the property.  We have built a showerhouse with a shower, toilet, laundry and fridge/freezer for those who may live onsite in tiny houses without those amenities or for people who may want to come and camp to participate in what's going on here!</description>

Common people should have access to all resources, get enough opportunities and be part of decision making processes impacting their lives. People around the world need to be supported in their struggle for liberation from oppression and exploitation. The rich, vibrant diversity of nature and culture needs to be preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/makkal-mandram-peoples-forum/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/makkal-mandram-peoples-forum/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our Commune comprises core members of our people's organization called Makkal Mandram (meaning People's Forum) which works among the most marginalized Tribal (indigenous)  and Dalit (caste oppressed) communities in the northern part of Tamil Nadu. Our main work is socio-political in nature. The core principles of our commune life includes social justice, equity, shared living (sharing household chores, raising children, social and political work), trust and cooperation.  We don't own private property. Our children go to government schools. We go to government hospitals for our healthcare needs. We believe that manual labour and brain work should be treated equally. We do physical labour in our farms and construction activities whenever need arises.</description>

      <name>Morganton Fellowship</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23090&quot;&gt;Morganton Fellowship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Jeremiah 6:16 - &quot;Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/morganton-fellowship/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/morganton-fellowship/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our names are Ryan and Siobhan Gagliardo.  We are a Christian husband and wife with five young children in search of spiritual fellowship in Morganton, NC.  If we had to define ourselves in denominational terms (which we are not fond of doing!) it would have to be Mennocostal Quaker, which breaks down to:  “Menno” for Mennonite (Menno Simons and the Anabaptists), “Costal” for Pentecostal (Book of Acts), and Quaker (John Woolman).  My wife and girls wear Mennonite dresses and my wife wears a headcovering.  We both became Christians in our teenage years while attending an Assemblies of God church.  We searched the Bible over the years and prayed to God for answers to life's greatest questions.  It has been very hard for us to fit into most churches and to accept the many unbiblical and unnatural lifestyles and traditions that often prevail.  

We share family Bible readings, prayer, and singing together most evenings and Sunday mornings.  We strive to raise our children to be quieter and well behaved, which has been an excruciating challenge, but well worth it thanks to God’s help.   

In application of our faith, we are growing more and more interested in how to live in greater harmony with the natural world that God has given us.  In the past we have raised chickens, ducks, and turkeys for meat and eggs.  We just recently got back into keeping twenty chickens under a tractor coop that we move around the property.  We have experience with keeping a few dairy goats and have learned a lot about the value of rotational pasture grazing for meat and milk.  I (Ryan) have nearly finished a complete reading of Dr. Westin A. Price’s, Nutrition and Physical Degeneration.  It has been a truly epic and life changing read for me that has resonated so deeply with the many reflections I have had about modern life over the years.   

My wife and I purchased a half acre of land in February 2017 with a small mobile home on it.  It is mostly cleared land with plenty of space for gardening.  Last year I took classes in the Asheville area about wild foods and medicine, which has touched upon many aspects of permaculture and sustainable living.  We are heading toward foraging more for our food, which often includes fresh road killed deer and a variety of wild nuts and greens.  There is also a lot of potential for fishing in local streams and lakes.  With help, we could grow a lot more food on our property as well as on a field just walking distance down the road which we have permission to use.  There is also a five acre bottomland plot just behind and adjoining our property which may soon become available to purchase.  

There is a house for sale with several acres just catty corner to our place with a large separate workshop/garage and partly finished upstairs living space.  There should also be a one acre homestead for sale just two houses down from us with a three bedroom house, fruit trees, and an already cleared field where there had been a garden in the past.            

We don’t currently have much additional room in our two bedroom house other than a futon in the school room.  Otherwise, we could park a small camper just next to the house and run a 120V power cord out to it.  We could offer backyard tent/yurt/or other? space surrounded by woods.  It is a quiet neighborhood on a side road which does not get much traffic.  We have neighbors, but enough woods in between that we can hardly see any of them from the backyard.        

We are currently off-grid for water and heat.  We draw water by hand from a shallow well just behind the house.  We haven’t perfected doing laundry by hand, but just recently found a hand wringer that we are about to use.  We are on the verge of transitioning into composting our human waste.  We also have a woodstove that we use for heat and a good amount of cooking.  Our goal is to also do more outdoor wood cooking in dutch ovens as well as a Green Egg grill/smoker.    

We are located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains just 15 min. north of South Mountain State Park in Morganton, NC.  The famous city of Asheville is under an hour away, which we visit often enough.  We love the outdoors and enjoy hiking, canoeing, camping, fishing, and foraging for wild foods.  My wild food class introduced me to several new friends in and around Asheville.   

We crave genuine loving fellowship with other believers or seekers of truth that are open to dialogue about life and faith.  A mutual commitment to life growth will be essential and openness to receive the input of others into the deepest and often most personal and touchy areas of our lives.  We try to be as Spirit-led and sensitive as possible, but real communal life will show us our truest selves very quickly. Our commitment is to utilize that experience to grow and allow God to refine and mature us in every way necessary.      

I have dropped my normal factory (glassblowing) work hours to allow me to take care of home projects and eventually discover a more earth and family-oriented source of income.  I have a few ideas that I am prayerfully exploring.     

Je parle aussi assez bien francais et donc les francophones sont les bienvenus!  J'ai voyage dans plusiers regions de la France et aussi un peu en Cote d'Ivoire.  Ce sont des pays et une langue qui me manque beaucoup.  

Hablo tambien bastante espanol.  Yo vivi algunos meses en Costa Rica y viaje a Nicaragua, Cuba, Guatemala, y Puerto Rico.            

May the Lord richly bless and lead you as you consider sharing fellowship with us!</description>

      <name>Community forming in Middle Tennessee</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23092&quot;&gt;Community forming in Middle Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Provide a haven for individuals or families centered on personal transformation, communication, sustainability, sharing, and connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/community-forming-in-middle-tennessee/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/community-forming-in-middle-tennessee/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our focus is to provide a judgment-free haven for individuals or families centered on personal transformation, communication, sustainability, sharing, and connection. We are committed to the ideas of shared labor and resources, inclusion, open-mindedness, non-judgment,  acceptance, personal freedom, support, and simple living.

We aspire for a small homestead inspired community built on principles of sustainability. We will attempt to create a home that lives in harmony with the environment, protects native plants and animals, and does not use resources faster than we can replenish them. Our community will be integrated with the land, and we will source our materials for building mainly on-site. We will have our own water supply (fresh water spring) and work towards being completely self-sufficient (growing food, raising animals, water collection, solar power, and composting toilets).

We believe in non-violent communication, compassion and radical honesty. Our goal is to contribute to a positive transformation of the world through open and honest communication. We believe in Anarchy, however, each Member will be held to their own Personal Responsibility. This means: committing to shared labor, attending community meetings, accepting the consequences of your actions, and resolving and amending whatever harm your actions might cause. We will participate in circle processes, regular meetings, and practice positive conflict resolution methods.

We are accepting of a wide range of alternative lifestyles, and are seeking Members who are open-minded, non-judgmental and accepting of other’s beliefs and choices and are looking for others who would like to join together to form an Intentional Community

Currently, we are 29/F, 31/M, 22/F

NOTE: We are still in the process of purchasing the land. We intend to launch in June 2018. We are working on building a website with an application for Residency.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23095&quot;&gt;Dry Gulch Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Dry Gulch Ecovillage teaches individual responsibility for self, society, and nature via the School of Intentioneering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/dry-gulch-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/dry-gulch-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Dry Gulch Ecovillage began in 2014 with the intent to grow a cooperative and ecological urban community. While many people have come and gone, a few have stayed, creating a partial income-sharing core-group. While our transient residents are less involved, we hope to eventually have all our rooms occupied by people who affirm their participation in the Dry Gulch Ecovillage. Our partial income-sharing results in a class-harmony cofamily, creating an urban community while planning two rural ecovillages, a community land trust and a land cooperative, providing options for living increasingly ecological lifestyles.

The Dry Gulch Ecovillage is home to an educational initiative called the School of Intentioneering, presenting and explaining the intentional communities movement of gifting and sharing cultures via print and soon also video media.

Other Dry Gulch initiatives include the Utopia Writer’s Guild for collaborative media productions, and Partnership Spirituality evolving patriarchal religions toward egalitarian religion, incorporating women's spirituality by deifying Mary of Magdala the same way as was Jesus of Nazareth, by simply saying it is so, then for believers, so it is!

The School of Intentioneering affirms 2027 as a convergence year of two-millennia of the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, and of two centuries since the invention of the term &quot;socialism,&quot; first printed in the Owenite journal &quot;The London Cooperative Magazine&quot; of 1827. 19th and 20th century Christian Socialism evolves in the 21st century into Partnership Spirituality, affirming class-harmony community as Jesus taught and as the Owenite communities practiced, opposed to the class-conflict of Marxist communism. Partnership Spirituality affirms the &quot;co-family&quot; of 3-to-9 unrelated adults with or without children, different from single-parent, nuclear, and extended families.

Dry Gulch initiatives support people in designing and enjoying the cooperative-ecological lifestyle of their choice.</description>

      <name>Unique Community Name Number 5</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23097&quot;&gt;Unique Community Name Number 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Sharing and Caring.

Each one, Teach One.

Not relying on systems of oppression.

Being self reliant.

Having FUN!,      .....no for real though, life should be fun.  Hard work can be FUN!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/unique-community-name-number-5/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/unique-community-name-number-5/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I purchased 40 acres in a rural valley, 4 miles from the shores of Lake Superior.  I helped restart a coop house in Madison, WI.  That inspired me to want to eventually live in an intentional community in the country side. 

 No masters, no leaders, but sharing and caring.  Creating different systems to slowly detach from the &quot;dominat&quot; culture systems most are raised to rely on.


For now, Spring 2018, it is a mostly &quot;raw&quot; piece of land.  Although it has been a farm off and on for 100 years.
Amenities include, a 40ft by 60ft cinder block garage, some animal pens, a driveway, grid electricity, a working well, and 15+ acres of open land, with a slight slope.

Several &quot;old timers&quot; in the area say it is a sweet parcel, and I agree. 

There is also a small creek that runs year round through the southern part of the land.

The southern and western boundaries are public land.  What the owned acres may lack in old big trees, are in the vast, surrounding public forest.  Those trees, County owned, connect to State land, that in turn connect to National forest.  Trees for days!

Some currants, hazelnuts, and chestnuts were planted last year, 2017.  There is also a thriving grape vine, a few black berry patches, and several apple trees sprinkled around.

For now, I am making the payments, getting the garden area going, and growing.  I would like to share it with like minded people.

DIY and DIF. 
I love traditional, primitive skills.  You know, one people did with their hands and minds before the computer space phone came about.  Doing things with friends and loved ones I find to be better then hiring someone to do it for you.  Push your comfort, and you can gain comfort.

Permaculture possibilities are abound, due to the slight and sever slopes the land has.  Potential potential potential.

Organic standards are a pretty good idea.  Following the Iroquois standard of 7 generations seems like a good idea too.</description>

The intention of this model is to show the viability of sustainable residential development, growing businesses, allowing tourism, while integrating/maintaining the current natural way of life within the environment, and to encourage other communities to copy the model everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/tierramar-intentional-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/tierramar-intentional-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;TierraMar is a Residential Intentional Community Project, on Pristine Land Overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Mexico. Sustainable and ecological design of housing in which homes create minimum pollution in construction; use local materials; and incorporate energy, water and waste systems which integrate the home and community into natural cycles avoiding waste. Sustainable Living in Mexico at its best!

OK. Let's Face it. Time is Moving On. It is. Faster and faster it seems... Or is it? Perhaps it's just the lifestyle that makes it seem as if it's moving faster.  Living in the moment helps slow down time and allows us to enjoy the journey... What if we redirected our energy and started giving ourselves the joy and peace we truly deserve.

How? Buy your little piece of paradise and live among like-minded individuals who care about mother earth, loving and supportive locals, clean air, clean waters, abundant fruit, burgeoning sustainabley-minded projects.

Come Join Me.  Create a New Life for Your Self and Have Some Fun While You're At It!

We strive as a community to develop and use sustainable technology and self contained systems for all applications. We have a strong focus on teamwork, consent and non-violent negotiations. We acknowledge and accept all genders and forms of gender expression and sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/solis-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/solis-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Solis Community is a young, forming community comprising of 3 adults in their 30s and 1 child, renting a 4 bedroom house on 6 acres on the outskirts of Perth, Western Australia.
Our goal is to rehabilitate the property which has been heavily farmed and turn it into a permaculture food forest to feed the community. We also have the opportunity to build tiny houses, yurts and tepees and park caravans and campers. We intend to set up external kitchen, bathroom and laundry facilities but those facilities are already available in the house so clean up and planting are the current priorities.
We also intend to fund solar power, water collection systems and a bore pump.
There are 2 rooms still empty in the house and a number of suitable places to park or build a tiny home.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23104&quot;&gt;Sentient Meat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Sentient Meat is a non-profit organization registered in Ohio that represents a collective of artist across all disciplines. Our mission is to foster growth for communities and artists through creative partnership, performance, and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sentient-meat/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sentient-meat/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our organization is centered around the idea that people work better together, and that artists work better when we’re not denied access to valuable, necessary resources that we need to subsist. Supporting art supports the community in ways that are real and tangible, and when art is treated as the important work that it is, the benefits reach far beyond the individuals creating it.

In a society where art and artists are often devalued and social safety nets are heavily restricted and even more heavily stigmatized, it’s important to organize and create the resources we need to support each other and let communal effort prevail. We aid in this process by driving programs for artist residency and easy access to necessary tools for development and creation: opportunities for education and collaboration, space for working and presenting, and more.

It’s a vast, cold, uncaring world out there. But as sci-fi fan writer Arthur D. Hiavaty once said, the whole point of society is that it’s supposed to be less unforgiving than nature. We have the ability to be more and to make it better by accepting each other and letting communal effort prevail. That’s where we come in.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23108&quot;&gt;Bright Moments Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Primary to our community focus is a proactive approach to mental health and personal growth and the establishment of high functioning relationships based upon what we call dynamic connection. Generally, we're looking to join with others to create a safe, connected, healthy, multi-generational, and sustainable community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bright-moments-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bright-moments-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;“What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others.” Pericles

In A Nutshell…
We are looking for others interested in discussing the creation of an intentional cooperative community. What follows is intended to give those who may be interested in joining us a little background on our perspectives, interests, and values.

A Sad State of Affairs…
Unfortunately, it is our opinion that we live in a society that is very sick. Politically, we are divided and seemingly incapable of sane governance by and for the people; Economically, the wealthiest 1% of Americans own more than 40% of the nation’s wealth, while the vast majority— around 80%, only own 7% of the wealth; Socially, we are increasingly intolerant of other cultural traditions, racial diversity, as well as gender and sexuality identifications, while hate speech, hate crimes, and mass killings are at an all-time high. Society is diseased and dysfunctional… and society is us.

Meanwhile, recent studies have revealed that approximately half of Americans are lonely or isolated, with many feeling that their relationships lack meaning. It’s interesting to consider that throughout human history we have lived in groups—clans, tribes, and extended families—and there are many cultures in the world that still live this way today. But, somehow, over time and generations, we got caught up in the American dream, with our nuclear families in homogenous neighborhoods and, generally, isolated lifestyles with all the consumer trappings we could ever imagine.

Now, it seems that many of us experience life as casualties of the so-called American dream: more socially isolated; devoting most of our lives to toil and drudgery in unfulfilling jobs; politically frustrated and disconnected; finding that all the technology, electronics, and things we work so hard to afford don’t really make us happy; and feeling stuck. American dream? Or nightmare!

We are also faced with extremely serious environmental challenges at this time, especially with many of our so-called leaders’ willingness to foolishly trash our natural heritage and trade in our ultimate survival for the short-sighted gains of industry and more short-term wealth for the top one percent! With everything from global warming to pollution and threats to our food supply, clean water, and clean air, how can we turn a blind eye and not be examples of the change that is needed?

Whether it’s the foods we eat, the products we use, the cars we drive, or the practices we support, we can make choices that support healthy ecosystems, environmental balance, and sustainability. The Earth is our home. We need to take care of it for our children and future generations. It is beyond irresponsible, like completely crazy, to do otherwise.

Why Intentional Community?
If any of this is ever going to get better, we will need to make some changes! Can we overcome our addictions to uncontrolled consumerism and learn to work together with mutual respect, love, and kindness for each other’s well-being and the greater good? Yes we can!

By joining together and sharing skills and resources, we can be part of the change that this world needs in order to survive. We can dramatically lessen our environmental footprint by sharing, everything from vehicles to washing machines! We can also collaborate and work together to create innovative new sources of income, allowing participants to pursue work that is creative and meaningful.

More About Us…
We are two people (female and male) looking for individuals, couples, or small family groups to join us. We would eventually like to be a group of at least ten to twelve members. Our preferred age-range for co-founders is 30’s to 60’s. We would like to connect with those who are generally positive, focused, energetic, fun-loving, and who share similar values and interests to ours.

Things We Value…

Regarding Mental/Emotional Health Advocacy…
It is estimated that 1 in 4 of us have immediate mental health conditions requiring treatment of some kind. But what about the other 75% of us? Just because we are able to function in our daily lives doesn’t mean we don’t have issues! We all need help at times dealing with relationships and communication issues, habits, behaviors, attitudes, making healthy choices, resolving conflicts, as well as things like self-esteem, confidence, and  self-empowerment.

Mental and emotional health counseling and therapy, as well as other self-help and empowerment practices, is what healthy people do! We are not only a part of this crazy human drama, we have steeped in it for many years, unconsciously absorbing whatever attitudes, beliefs, perspectives, assumptions, and behaviors were around us or were psychologically convenient. What’s wrong with acknowledging the craziness and dysfunction and accepting that we all have issues and we can all do better?

Attending counseling or therapy sessions still has negative connotations for many people. We may see ourselves doing as well or even better than people we know, and overall, we are functioning fairly well in our day-to-day lives, so why do we need help? There is usually an assumption that something has to be very wrong to require seeing a mental health professional. Unfortunately, this type of attitude prevents many of us from engaging in a process that can lead to increased self-awareness, better communication, higher functioning relationships, and happier, more expansive lives.

We are all, potentially, extraordinary people, capable of extraordinary things. Why not be proactive in dealing with our psycho/social/emotional functions when it will only benefit us (and those around us)? Why not take a closer look at our behaviors and attitudes and understand in a deeper way how they directly influence our own lives and affect others? Why not learn how to improve the ways we communicate? Why not learn how to be better listeners and be more emotionally supportive of the people we love? Why not learn how to be better partners in our primary relationships? 

We believe that transparency is important in relationships, in general. We think that transparency is especially important when it comes to building a trusting high-functioning group of multiple adults, from many different cultures and backgrounds, with no previous connections to each other. How can we be transparent with each other if we’re not able to be transparent with ourselves? 

We think that building a successful intentional community requires interpersonal skills far beyond what is considered “normal.” We need to become very good at listening, questioning, taking turns, understanding each other, supporting each other, resolving conflicts, solving problems, focusing and following through on tasks, saying what we mean and meaning what we say, being accountable and self-responsible, and being able to work towards something beyond our own wants and needs.

Some Basic Assumptions?
• We can accomplish much more by working together, than we can alone
• We can experience a higher quality of life by sharing resources and engaging in activities that contribute to the greater good
• We can all make a difference
• We are much happier when we experience connection and develop relationships that have depth and meaning, based on transparency and trust
• We are more fulfilled when we connect in meaningful ways
• Time is an illusion; time is of the essence; there’s no time like the present
• This life is a tremendous and brief opportunity for us to seize
• We each have tremendous creative potential
• This life is ours to explore, understand, creatively define, and celebrate
• Once we learn to be connected to ourselves, we can be more effective
• Many of us need help to understand and heal our fragmented psyches and behaviors
• There is no shame in needing a little help

“Are you in earnest? Seize this very minute
What you can do, or dream you can, begin it;
Boldness has genius, power, magic in it.
Only engage, and then the mind grows heated;
Begin and then the work will be completed.”
(Johann Wolfgang von Goethe)

Recommended Reading…
We have found this article (link below) very helpful in understanding the “pathology of normalcy,” which illustrates and details the societal pathology (sickness/disease briefly mentioned earlier) and its origins that is pervasive and normal in our society today. We think it is extremely important to share this understanding and perspective with anyone who may be interested in developing healthier alternatives to the current societal model.

Changing the way things are at the macro level will, likely, take a very long time and many generations of us. But, we have the opportunity to start now and get the ball rolling to create something better! A new paradigm is needed and there are people like us all over the world working to make it happen.

Some may find this article a little challenging, as it is longish (equivalent of about 22 typed pages of about 500 words each) and written by an academic. However, once you get started it reads very well and though one might want to look one or two things up, it really isn’t too bad! We encourage you to set a little time aside and check it out…

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23110&quot;&gt;Woodsy Way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Friends living in community together and enjoying life, striving towards a joyous sustainable existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/woodsy-way/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/woodsy-way/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We aspire to be a small coliving community of friends who enjoy practicing permaculture together.  We have had a lot of joy in living with others in the past, gardening, playing board games, cooking awesome food together, playing music.  We hope to welcome others into our lives who are looking for the same.  We are especially hoping to find people who have land based ambitions which we can help to meet.  

Steve is a mathematician, Lorna is a veterinarian. We are both interested in math and science, sustainable living, board games, singing, playing instruments. Steve plays brazilian jiujitsu. Lorna is into dog training. We are pretty fun people to hang out with. 

Existing Infrastructure:

We have a few fenced acres planted with nut trees on 40' centers (chestnut, hickory, heartnut, butternut, pecan, black walnut english walnut), and fruit trees (pawpaw, persimmon, juneberry, seabuckthorn, apple, asian pear, etc).  These trees are all just yearlings right now.  Irrigation system is in place for these plants.  If yield tables are correct, we should be able to get all of our calories from these plantings in around a decade (for about 8 people).

We have a very nice little house with 3 bedrooms.  We occupy one of the bedrooms, and are open to single people, couples, triads or whatever filling the remaining two rooms.

We are also planning on improving the house with most of our excess wages.  Adding superinsultion, making the house all electric, adding solar panels, getting a solar vehicle etc.

Some caveats:

We both do not drink alcohol, smoke, or do any drugs. We are not interested in living with anyone who does: sorry about that! We are friends with people who do, no judgement, just would prefer not to live in a context where these things are present.

We are both pretty liberal. Open to being friends with, and living with people with differing political views, but you would have to enjoy arguing about this stuff if so (which we would be fine with!).

Also, while we have not planted any GMOs we are also open to the idea of planting GMOs (for instance, the CUNY GMO American chestnut). We also use Roudnup to control some persistent perennial weeds on our property.  We are open to accepting people with different views on this, and in the spirit of consensus based decision making we would be willing to stop using roundup/ not plant any GMOs if we can manage without them. Hopefully this is not a deal breaker!</description>

      <name>Green Acres Permaculture Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23112&quot;&gt;Green Acres Permaculture Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; GREEN ACRES PERMACULTURE VILLAGE is a small, retrofit, intergenerational intentional community in a core suburban college town neighborhood that integrates self-knowledge and expression with a shared culture among humans and the living Earth to encourage abundance on every level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/green-acres-permaculture-village-current/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/green-acres-permaculture-village-current/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;GREEN ACRES PERMACULTURE VILLAGE is a retrofit intergenerational intentional community carved from within an existing suburban neighborhood in college town. The evolving Village, currently featuring three adjacent homes and permacultured grounds, with pathways and commons areas (two greenhouses, a workshop space, chicken house, shed, patio) offers itself as a template for transformation of suburban life. 

Village rhythms feature both work and play. Offering workshops, work days, weekly Community Dinners, and Seasonal Celebrations, we both integrate internally and promote outreach to the larger community. To this end, we offer tours, plus sponsor and encourage WWOOFers, including Indiana University Interns and Sustainability Classes, to demonstrate and promote values that lie below money as far as possible. To this end we keep rents low, work together on projects, encourage each other’s self-expression and entrepreneurial skills, honor our communion with the living Earth, and aim to live and work in place inside a sharing economy that values both individual expression and community cooperation. 

Established in 2009 by founder Ann Kreilkamp who dedicated her own yard for a Green Acres Neighborhood Garden, both our sense of community and our capacity for growing food have evolved organically over time. In 2014 Rebecca Ellsworth, an organic gardener for 40 years, joined us, and from then on, the cultivation and preservation of food and value-added products for both Village use and sales, including a small CSA, have taken hold.

In 2017 we were invited to establish a permaculture garden behind the house of a neighbor in exchange for part of the produce, and plan to offer this service to others in the Green Acres neighborhood.
  
Early in 2018 we created a ten-member Village Board that is now researching legal structures to determine which type will best meet our needs as we go forward. We expect to add houses and grounds to the Village over time.

Green Acres Permaculture Village is networked with the Green Acres Neighborhood Association, Dandelion Village, Bloomington Co-operative Living, Bloomington Council of Neighborhood Associations, the Association for Regenerative Culture, NuMundo, and the Federation of Intentional Communities.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23118&quot;&gt;Grimm Acres Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; ​Since you can't have an intentional community without intention, ours is to simply &quot;thrive together&quot;.

Everyone who lives or visits Grimm Acres brings a lifetime of experience to share with others. Even the children have unique experiences, perspectives and skills to offer and teach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/grimm-acres-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/grimm-acres-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Grimm Acres Community Living, is a beautiful place to put down some roots, enjoy nature, explore the simple life, a time for quiet reflection, and be a part of a community that works together to achieve community goals.

Grimm Acres is a wonderful place to be at one with nature, animals, birds, and the trees that surround us. While at the same time each member of the community can engage in meaningful work. Creating tiny living shelters, discovering nature trails, creating healthy gardens to grow community food, animal husbandry, and discovering the meaning of community as we all work side by side together.

Grimm Acres is the best place to rediscover who you are, who you want to be, and where you want to be in life. Here you can learn new things, become a part of a community that is sustainable and self-sufficient, be able to help others, and journey with peace.

Living simply is the Grimm Acres way, and understanding that our place here on earth is to learn and help others learn in the process. We embrace learning new things, learning from others, and understand that many great minds can achieve much more than just one great mind.

Teaching our local community on gardening, identifying plants, trees, canning, building simple shelters, and how working as a community can enhance the lives around you.

Orion and Josie Grimm settled in Waynesburg, KY. Both with the vision of creating a place full of family, love, and a sense of community. Understanding that in today's tough economic times, how cool it would be to open up their homestead to others to create an intentional community that relishes in the simple things of life. Creating a place where others could enjoy the beauty that surrounds them, garden together, raise animals together, build together, and eventually become a self-sustained intentional community. After all, it takes a village. Troy and Dawn have lived in communities, such as Alpha Farm in Oregon and were invited to Grimm Acres ​as part of the core group with their children, Heather and Ivy.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23119&quot;&gt;The Xperiment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Today we are members of a civilization, which is getting ever more exhausted not only in terms of resource management systems, forms of government and political will for change, but above all in terms of basic human connection – our ability to communicate honestly and emotionally among each other and with the environment.
Both as individuals and as species we are standing on the edge of a cliff in all important aspects of our existence – environmentally, economically, socially and spiritually. Many (actually most) of us are in a state of free fall, whether we realize it or not. However, one thing is certain – we are becoming more and more aware of these issues – whether with our minds, souls or hearts, simply because they form our reality. Today!
Regardless of where we live on the planet, the everyday lives of most of us consist of endless wandering between the elements of our decaying social, economic and political systems and our own internal struggles for self-awareness and search for meaning, friendship and love…
If any of this sounds familiar to you, if in any way those thoughts and emotions are also in your mind and soul, if you feel time has come for you to look for a change from this reality, then you are standing at the doorstep of one of the places where this is possible.
After all, change is a matter of choice. We already made ours.
This is the place where YOU can also make this choice.
Let’s reinvent our lives TOGETHER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-xperiment/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-xperiment/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This project’s goal is to create an international social and cultural center, combined with sustainable lifestyle amidst the beautiful nature of the Balkan mountain.</description>

It will be made up of 8-12 community members that will do nearly everything together except work. During business hours everyone will go out to their individual jobs in the community.

To free ourselves from depression, anxiety, and avoidance we will make and follow a detailed schedule every day. We will wake up, exercise, cook and eat breakfast, have a morning check in, go to work, cook and eat dinner, have a group therapy session, and have planning and practical meetings. 

This community is for people who want to stop escaping their life and start living life to its fullest! As such we will seek to avoid escapist behavior such as drugs, mass media and entertainment, binge-eating, etc. Technology will be sharply curtailed in the house. There will be no TV except for special occasions. Laptops and phones are allowed but they are only to be used for specific tasks and not for entertainment.

Many people with severe social anxiety and depression also suffer from other conditions such as general anxiety, ADHD, bipolar, body image issues, self harm, drug addiction etc. When you first come to the community you may already have a job or you may be in such a state that you are unemployable. We will build you up and in a few months you will be ready to get a job.</description>

Hoping to reach some awesome folks who'd be interested in collaborating with me because all projects are done better together! Number of folks that could be intrinsically involved will depend on the property, but right now, I'm putting out feelers for a founding group of 3-4 folks that have some money they'd like to invest in a dreamy space! I am deeply in love with community and I want to make a little community with you!

Some ideas I have for the space:
Non-profit driven
Music venue
Community space
Workshop/meet-up space
Cafe/bar
Garden
Flowers

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23129&quot;&gt;Liberty Ship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; This community is focused on providing an environment for individuals to build comfort and stability in their own lives. We offer various living arrangements for people to make specialized contributions of their labor, in exchange for a place to live inexpensively, and with plenty of privacy and autonomy. The household atmosphere is quiet and reflective. A focus on self improvement is strongly encouraged. We try to match each member with a labor commitment that they genuinely enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/liberty-ship/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/liberty-ship/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a couple that bought a large house on a half acre in the suburbs of Klamath Falls. The property was owned by a married couple for 40 years until the end of their lives, and their enormous contribution of personal energy shows all over the property. It's too much for us to take on alone. One of us operates an online business to pay the house bills, and the other does all the fixing and remodeling. We are transforming the property slowly into a collective community of individuals, each of whom contributes some hours of their favorite labor in lieu of some rent. Individuals need to have their own income, but it can be modest. 

As of Aprill 2018, we have a renter who prepares meals as her work trade. This will always be a position in the community, as neither owner is inclined to cooking. She will probably move on early 2019, at which point we will need a replacement kitchen magicworker. 

Our current primary focus is our child, and we are hoping to find another family or single parent with children around the same age (6 yrs) to cohabitate. Our daughter is homeschooled, brilliant, and lonely for kid interaction. The ideal match is someone who wants to take on a little more than their fair share of the child supervising, in exchange for below-market rent ($300 util included) in one of the main bedrooms. 

We also have a huge established garden we need someone to take over. We can offer summer and fall tent space in the yard for someone to take that on; veggies and yard care. If you would like use of the house, we would ask $100 a month for your utilities. We would like to have periodic flocks of meat chickens for household food, too. The owners have black thumbs and need help in this arena.

Finally, there is a large area in our unfinished basement, and a very well built shed in the yard that could be converted to additional living space. One of the owners is extremely handy, but there is very much work to do in the house and we can always use additional help. If you are eager to learn about home repair, interested in an apprenticeship, and don't mind living in an unfinished basement room, please get in touch.</description>

By living together, we can lower our ecological footprint (resource use), be happier, and help to show others a better way to live!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/elko-tree-streets-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/elko-tree-streets-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Dan and Jackie (married couple) bought a large house in August of 2017 to turn into an intentional community here in the &quot;Tree Streets&quot; of Elko, NV.  They moved down from Boise, Idaho where they had maintained an intentional community for 9 years.  The community in Boise (Permacultureland) was a fabulous experience that Dan and Jackie want to replicate here in Elko, NV.  We have a strong commitment to building and fostering the development of community as the road to resolving many of the world's problems.

As community members, we often eat dinner together, share chores, and maintain open lines of communication that allow for an easy way to resolve conflicts before they arise.

The house itself is a large four bedroom, two bath house.  The basement is in various sections, but the community is working to finish off a large section of the basement to provide another three bedroom, one and a half bath living space.  There is also a separate part of the basement that serves as the community workshop with a full compliment of tools.

When the house was purchased in 2017 the lot was essentially a bare weedy space.  Since that time, a large number of fruiting and nut producing trees and bushes have been planted.  Gardens are currently being built with an irrigation system coming soon.  After the basement living space is finished off, the community will be building a semi-subterranean, earth-sheltered, passive solar, four-season greenhouse.  When that is done we'll move onward with more projects to increase the energy-efficiency and sustainability of the community. 
 Lots of projects to turn this community into the permaculture paradise it will one day be.  Involvement in these projects is not required to be a community member.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23139&quot;&gt;God is true love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Serve God continuously&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/god-is-true-love/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/god-is-true-love/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hello to everyone interested in true love and wisdom that comes only from God. We are a spiritual community that follows the true translation of the bible. We don't have any religion, we just follow the right path that God wants for His creatures. We believe in predestination  and universal salvation. We wait for the coming of God and His right judgment. Until that time we live a simple life in nature, doing what God intends for us to do, farming and eating what we are producing. We don't have insurance of any kind, because we believe that only God is our insurance in everything. We don't need any insurance from people. Our future is in the hands of God, like bible says. It's a sin and a big blasphemy to God to say that we believe in Him but we go to men and ask from them insurance for the future. In consequence we don't work for men because the insurance is obligatory. We work our land given to us by God. He is merciful with us and gives us rain and we have what to eat. In this country the insurance for house is not obligatory, and the taxes for land and house are still low. This area where we live is peaceful because God protects us. It is written that if we serve Him we will have everything we need in order to survive here and be happy. I suppose many have such a dream and we can say it is possible, but only with God. We expect to hear from brothers and sisters interested in this way of living. You are welcome.</description>

We value honesty, accountability, mutualism, connection to the earth, non-consumerism, creativity, fun, alternative economics, and simplicity. Other goals include being a space that is empowering, a source for our own personal development and a reprieve from larger structural oppression, a resource for mutual aid, a life close to the land, a place lush with plants and food with supportive, generous residents to share burdens and multiply joys. 

Our community is on a third acre of land with 4 units, set up as private rooms and shared-use common areas outside the houses and in the kitchen, baths and living rooms within the houses. There is also a garden space, bicycle space, tools and multi-purpose workshop, a deck, fire pit, entertaining space, outdoor kitchen, float tank, outdoor shower (coming soon) plus other leisure and sustainability features. 

We, like many worldwide, are trying to figure out how to have different relationships with each other and the world. We sense the urgency and couldn’t wait any longer to start working towards living the dream!

Some other values current members hold and want to embody and see in other members and are community are:

Courtesy and respect of others
Flexibility
Honesty
Accountability and responsibility
Mutual Aid/Collectivism
Ecologically-conscious, connected and healthy living

      <name>Prairie Song Farms</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23148&quot;&gt;Prairie Song Farms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Holistic Goal - Vision and Mission revised and updated Spring 2013
The holistic goal contains four primary sections: Statement of Purpose, Quality of Life, Forms of Production, and Future Resource Base. Each section builds on the next, and descriptions of each section are given briefly next to each heading title.

Statement of Purpose - The overarching mission
    To build a resilient community that provides opportunities for people to learn how to live in harmony with each other and the cosmos.

“Quality of Life, forms of production, and future resource base goals have to be combined into one comprehensive, holistic goal. Otherwise decisions could be made in support of one aspect, while damaging another.” from Holistic Management

Quality of Life - A description of how we want our life to be, in the context of the farm, based on what we most value
    Life at the farm is latent with an underlying peace and fosters harmony in diversity. We live together honestly, passionately, and creatively in community. Our work is inspired by our individual passions, yet contributes toward a shared purpose. 

We want to develop an infrastructure and landscape that generates long-term food self-sufficiency, energy and water independence, and economic abundance; this involves commitment to necessary systems of organization to maintain what is developed, revising systems as needed to respond to changing conditions and new information. We want to share the lessons and opportunities from the farm to the community of Fairfield and beyond. And we want to help build a place where future generations can grow up naturally, comfortably and without fear.

Forms of Production - What we have to produce to fulfill the purpose of Prairie Song Farms and create the qualities of life that we desire
Community celebrations and activities that foster community spirit
An environment that is open to art, music, dancing, social gatherings, and other aspects of life that generally promote richness, creativity and fun
Comfortable, functional, and energy efficient dwellings
Renewable energy for electrical needs, and load calculations for existing structures
Plants for food and medicine, and care taking guidelines to support their growth and use
Food processing and storage space
Systems of organization that support orderliness and maintenance of community spaces and equipment
Community kitchen use
Living room and porch use
Tools use
Trash and recycling protocol
Greenhouse use
Methods of communication to help us harmonize our activities, including systems of accountability for project planning/implementation/maintenance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/prairie-song-farms/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/prairie-song-farms/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Where We Started
 
The idea of Prairie Song Farms is that Sustainable Living Students from the University can come to apply on site “hands-on” knowledge that they learn in the classroom, while at the same time establishing a perennial, self supporting system of energy, infrastructure, polyculture, education, and community.
 
When we first began in 2009 we planted a garden, and began making the old farm home liveable. That spring and summer consisted of painting, re-flooring, putting in a septic system, installing a sump-pump in the floor of the basement in the farmhouse, planting trees, sealing the roof of the farmhouse, fixing the gutters, cleaning out the attic and sealing off the front porch to make the place livable, along with getting to know the land with everything we did.
 
In the Fall of 2010 we had an incredible momentum returning to Prairie Song Farm from California in a ‘69 International school bus with seven college students. We kept the momentum going by the building of a StrawBale cottage inspired and funded by our newest member of the team, Jeremiah. We built the cottage in a month, and simultaneously started on the renovation of the south barn/storage shed which is now a home with attached greenhouse and water catchment unit.

The 2012-2013 year saw a changing scene at the farm, with the 2010 crew graduating and leaving the farm, and a new group gradually emerging. Some of the babies left, some new babies moved in. In the spring of 2013 a permaculture design plan was made by James for his senior project, and Rick Valley -an experienced permaculturist from Oregon- came for a 2 days to consult the farm on its permaculture design and long-term vision. The farm also got a partial grant to build a greenhouse. The greenhouse is now up - completed over the summer 2013, and more activity will ensue based on the people at the farm from here on out. The permaculture design plan is in a binder at the farm in hard copy, as well as online shared with the group on google drive.

In December 2013 we experienced a fire in the top floor of the farmhouse.Quick thinking by Victor Orne and help from all members (we were having a farm meeting downstairs when the fire started) plus quick response from the Fairfield Fire Department saved the building. The fire was the impetus to do the long-considered renovations to the old place. 

The entire top story was removed and replaced with a Victor Orne designed and implemented simpler and taller roof. The building’s electrical system was upgraded, heating vents were reconfigured and improved, and the outside foundation was insulated. As of 2015, a new metal roof is in place, the South steps have been rebuilt, foam insulation has been added, the West porch is now a heated bedroom, the East deck has been re-roofed, drywall and painting are done. It’s a much more expansive interior on both floors.

In October 2013 Jeffrey &amp;amp; Linda began building their future home out in the Northwest hay field. Fall, 2017 the house is now complete.

June 2014. Several PSF members graduated and launched themselves into the world. We miss them dearly and look forward to their return visits.natives to meet our water, food, shelter, and energy needs. Ultimately propelling the shift of the paradigm of scarcity into one of absolute abundance.”</description>

We embrace uniquely beautiful self-identities, whether acquired by nature or nurture, chosen by your best self, or some chaotic combination.  There is wisdom shared with pack in where we have been, and where we choose to go.

We believe in honoring our ancestors, shaking collective and familial skeletons out of their closets, and preparing the next generations by co-parenting feral, conscious children.

We rejoice in eating well-raised meat, bow in thankful joy for the fungus, and bend our gratitude for wheat.  We strive to tread lightly and joyfully on this earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/hearth-howl/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/hearth-howl/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are forming a bold community. We unapologetically pursue healing for ourselves, our neighbors, and the world. The community will center on a holistic healing practice, deep bonds of intimacy and support between members, and continual learning and growth.

The holistic healing practice will operate as a business (business plan in development) and be served by our deep interrelationships as we think and work with clients together.

Deep interrelationships will include polyamory, wildly consensual kink, and the sort of close friendships where we talk about everything. We believe in pack: People with whom we share deep, intuitive connection, easy laughter, and sustainable growth.  

Witchy warrior-queens, polyamorous high priestesses and knights errant are welcome and will be well-fed. Spirit of wolf or dragon? All the better.

We already live a fantasy, and we’re growing our fantasy into the world. If what we describe touches on things close to your heart, reach out.</description>

The community is modeled somewhat after D-Acres Permaculture Community Farm in New Hampshire and Essex Farm in upstate New York.  MPFU has this as a starting point: 30 acres, an already established and growing low-tech ethical farm enterprise, a desire for like-minded farming individuals to inhabit at least the single house on the property--a 2000-sq ft five-bedroom Cape Cod home with shared kitchen, bathroom and common areas, and a desire to provide the livelihood and sustenance of the members via farming and related industries.  Members are expected to be farmers and enjoy farming. :)</description>

      <name>Victoria Unschooling Project</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23160&quot;&gt;Victoria Unschooling Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Victoria Unschooling Project is a community of unschooling families living outside of Victoria BC, Canada. We're pro-vaccination, screen-positive, body-positive, LGBT-positive, and pro-childrens’ rights. Our primary motivation is to create a childrens’ paradise, in which our kids can play freely with each other and enjoy their childhoods, and where adults united in a shared belief of peaceful parenting can make friends and build community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/victoria-unschooling-project/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/victoria-unschooling-project/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Unschooling families with school-aged children and younger are warmly invited to join a new intentional community close to Victoria, on Vancouver Island, BC. We’re looking at places 20 minutes' driving distance to downtown Victoria, and invite unschooling families to join in and help steer the project. We'll build houses on the land (or rent or buy nearby), and have a main building on the land to provide a communal space for an unschool and a community kitchen, and extra units on the land could be used to host prospective community members, worldschoolers, and other guests.

We currently run a weekly unschooling meet-up in Beacon Hill Park every Wednesday, and an annual unschooling family camping trip every June in Goldstream provincial park.  Email us, or check out our Facebook for details.

What we are:

We're people who believe that community is good for humans, and that kids needs space and time to play with other kids.  We buy our food from shops, travel and go to restaurants, enjoy films and TV and games.  No cult here, no eco-hippie ideals about growing everything we eat, we're not trying to disappear from society or prepare for the apocalypse.  We're just a small co-housing of friends communally raising our free-range kids together.

We are unschoolers. We believe that children will flourish if given space to pursue their own interests in their own ways, and we will commit to creating a space in which they can be free to play, explore and learn at their own pace.

We are body-positive. We believe that children (and adults) can be trusted to choose for themselves what to do with their bodies: what to eat, when to sleep, how to exercise, and so on. While individual families may make their own agreements regarding food, meals, and bedtimes, we do not police the choices of other children and adults. We acknowledge that some people are disabled; we acknowledge that some people are fat; we acknowledge that all states of the body are morally neutral. In short: we don’t police kids’ eating, we don’t fat-shame people, and we don’t go around telling people sugar causes cancer.

We are screen-positive. We believe that children (and adults) can be trusted to choose for themselves what to do with their time, and moderate their own hobbies, interests, and learning methods. While individual families may have their own agreements regarding screen usage, we will not be asking other adults to police our own kids’ screen use timings.  And high speed Internet for all!

We strive to be interesting, and interested. Our wishlists for learning and hobby spaces on the land include: a veg patch, a craft and making space, a music studio, a quiet library space, and a den for video gaming. We will also take part in the local unschooling and homeschooling community: we will organise outings to museums, farms, aquariums, forests, makerspaces, and other places of interest and learning.

What we are not: 

We're not big on drug and alcohol use, but not huge haters either. We believe kids shouldn't have to deal with drunk/high jerks, and if getting wasted/high several times a month is your idea of fun, then we probably won't get along.  

We are not an eco-commune. We will not be growing significant quantities of our own food, nor will we be setting up any kind of community farm. The main reason for this is because we have lives, and hobbies, and we want to spend time with our children, and buying food from a store gives us time to do those things.   Also our children roam free about the land and large quantities of land given over to crops, fenced off as inaccessible, or dangerous farming equipment on the land will all hinder this. If it is important to you to grow a significant quantity of your own food, or to have access to large-scale industrial farming equipment, this may not be the community for you.

We are not a sustainability-focused commune. While recycling is lovely, we acknowledge that 80% of pollution comes from industrial waste, and we strive to keep our own sustainability interests small-scale and unstressful. There will be meat-eating, use of disposable diapers, and imperfect recycling practices going on in the community. If you’re looking to absolutely minimise your carbon footprint, this may not be the commune for you.

We are not a vegan commune. We expect families to take responsibility for their food needs in their independent housing units, and what families choose to eat is their concern. We will be running a large community dinner a couple of times a week, and this will not be vegan by default (we hope, instead, that there will be several options.)  If it is important to you that other members of your community are vegan, this may not be the commune for you.

The Victoria Unschooling Project is vaccination-positive and science-positive; this is not negotiable; if your family are anti- vaccination, there is no place for you here.

We are not going to be living on a building site.  If you can construct your own tiny house in a couple of weeks, go for it.  If not, get a professional to do it.  There will be no rusting automobiles on blocks, no half-constructed buildings, no mud pits where a house may someday be built.

We are not trying to live money-free.  We have jobs, either working in Victoria or working online.  We want to be able to collectively invest in playgrounds and fun stuff for our kids, enjoy good food, and travel.  If you're broke and have no interest in work, or you want to live a cashless existence, then our bourgeois values will likely leave you unhappy.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23162&quot;&gt;Solidarity Farm at Maybrook Lodge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Mission – 
1) To provide nutrient-dense, organic, ethical food to the cooperatively minded of the mid/lower Hudson valley and the greater NYC area.
2) To provide opportunities for retreat, recreation, connection, and education in transformative living skills like permaculture, regenerative farming, cooperative living, personal development, social justice and political activism, and more.
3) To provide a home, a community, and livelihood to those drawn by this vision and the values embodied within it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/solidarity-farm-at-maybrook-lodge/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/solidarity-farm-at-maybrook-lodge/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a new community forming in Kerhonkson NY based at an old Catskills retreat center about 2hrs driving from NYC.   There is a good foundation starting with a democratic ownership structure, 20+ bedrooms, 15acs of land, and connections to NYC community.  We want this to be a home for fellow radicals who also feel that cooperation, regenerative ecological relationships, social justice, and more are the essential values of our time, and (we hope!) the foundations of a society that can adress the challenges of climate change with some hope of &quot;success&quot; 

https://www.instagram.com/solidarityfarmny/
https://www.facebook.com/SolidarityFarmatMaybrook/

 The location is a former Catskills retreat in Kerhonkson NY in the rich Rondout Valley. (After renovation) there will be 20+ bedrooms, abundant community spaces, artist and craft workspaces, commercial kitchen and sustainable food education space, big dance hall and performance space and more!

Cooperative economic opportunities– there are various enterprises possible on the land

We are getting the farm business started by selling whole-farm shares to other intentional communities and coops in NYC. We are initially offering community-sized CSA shares: a bulk delivery of  veggies/eggs/meat delivered each week to the respective community/coop house.  

Other business ventures include farmstays, retreats, workshops, music and performance events, green building, artisan products and much more. 

Creative and cooperative/entrepreneurial types encouraged to check us out! Visitors always welcome.

Ganas, an intentional community in Staten Island with 70 members will be an “anchor” customer.  One of the side benefits of the project is a place to stay in a community in NYC on days off, delivery days, etc. and be connected to a growing network of intentional community in NYC and beyond!

Likewise, housing insecurity can increase the risk of being targeted by policing and incarceration, can negatively affect eligibility for employment, and can impact a community’s stability and resiliency.

We envision a resilient network of cooperatives, built on self-determination and mutual aid, that are run by and for low-income and marginalized residents. We envision thriving communities: where people have their needs met, have access to support and services, and where members can build relationships to work together on neighborhood issues and social justice issues that affect the Twin Cities area as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/mutual-aid-twin-cities-housing-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/mutual-aid-twin-cities-housing-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;MATCH Co-op provides sustainable and accessible housing for low-income people, particularly individuals from marginalized communities; empowers people to run autonomous residences; expands accessible cooperative housing in the Twin Cities; and creates a basis for thriving communities.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23166&quot;&gt;Baynton Community House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; See above... we're working on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/baynton-community-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/baynton-community-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We live in a neighborhood of Philadelphia called Germantown that is on the outskirts of the city, but still in city limits. So we have denser housing and many businesses, but also a lot of green space. One of the most beautiful parks, the Wissahickon is just a mile or two away. Our house is a large mansion from the 1860s. Some of us have lived here for as many as 4-5 years, but we are only recently beginning to have more formal conversation about what this community living is all about! So the intentionality has been evolving and is just getting to a place of being more officially established. We've had a few of those meetings so far and will likely be continuing that process over the next few months. (as of July 2018)

There are 8 of us living here, 3 cats, and 1 dog. Our age range is 27-48. 

Currently, we have a grocery and dinner share, where we combine and split all of our grocery purchases and we each cook for the house one meal a week. We share responsibilities of home upkeep and have monthly house meetings. We grow food at a local farm and do working member hours for a discount at our local food co-op. We interact often with our neighbors who are of varying degrees of communal living as well. We host a weekly game night, solstice and equinox gatherings, communication and meditation workshops, and we have a bit of a village vibe with a bread baker, kombucha maker, and public music events at the local garden. We also have an optional car share and are exploring other communal ownership possibilities. 

Enough about us, now how bout you… 
- We’re seeking community-minded people with experience and/or strong desire to live communally. 
- Please be willing to put some roots down with us and see us more as family than roommates. 
- Rooms vary from $250-$450/month and we split utilities that average $75/month. 
- A security deposit of one month’s rent is required, and 2 month’s notice is required if/when you move out. 

We have a room opening up for August or September 2018.</description>

      <name>North Star Family Ranch</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23176&quot;&gt;North Star Family Ranch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are a Homesteaders, Preppers, Survivalists and Freedom Loving Patriots Intentional Community with a &quot;Bug Out&quot; option. Our objective is to establish a Sustainable Homestead for Full or Part Time Residency that has the added benefit of providing each person / member the following: 1. Share / Live with each other at pre-set “Bug Out” locations during times of disasters, 2. Share / teach each other their unique abilities - skills and knowledge, and to 3. Share / combine each others resources – possessions and finances with the community as a whole. In other words, every member working together as one to help each other.

Why? Because: A) The world is restless and now has the potential to rapidly digress into a state of political, financial, environmental and/or natural disaster chaos. B) Depending on the Government or some other Social Entity to protect you during a collapse is a no go, so self reliance is a must. And C) Joining forces is far better in every way, less work, much safer and more cost effective, than attempting to go it alone. Having a Network of skilled and trustworthy people / friends plus the option of different housing locations is the ideal Survival Scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/north-star-family-ranch/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/north-star-family-ranch/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;All Homesteaders, Preppers, Survivalists and Freedom Loving Patriots who are willing to work together as one cohesive group are now invited to join a unique Sustainable Intentional Community with a &quot;Bug Out&quot; option. Our plan is to have three safety locations / evacuations zones, one each in Northern and Southern USA, and one out of the country. A place where you can come as follows: 1. Short Term visit as a “Vacationing Member” - with optional classes, 2. Live and Work there full or part time as a “Residential Member” - additional requirements do apply, and/or 3. Extended Emergency stay as a “Hardship Member” - come “Bug Out” when a disaster hits your area.

And just so you know, we are not a doomsday group, rather we are a very happy, normal, friendly, sincere and caring group of people who are hopeful about having a good future, Plus we believe in God, live by the Ten Commandments, and love our country, families and one another. But just in case there is a future disaster, like a grid down, large natural or man made disaster, and or a government collapse, we intend to make a positive impact on people's lives by getting them ready for that scenario, nevertheless, we hope that a bad outcome never happens.

Core activity will be growing food and in general being sustainable/regenerative. It would be great, in fact, to be able to regenerate depleted land if available.

Note that the community name is not final and will be selected by the members. Details such as community type will be refined by members.</description>

      <name>Casper, WY Afterworld Transition Town</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23182&quot;&gt;Casper, WY Afterworld Transition Town&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We hope to create a sustainable community through which to preserve the best of humanity in the worst of times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/casper-wy-afterworld-transition-town/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/casper-wy-afterworld-transition-town/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We're hoping to find others who'd like to purchase homes in Casper in the West Garden Creek subdivision or a nearby one (preferably West Garden Creek) just to the west of Nancy English Park and to the north of Dead Horse Hill (find us on NextDoor) who'd like to create an urban community of preppers who are focused on trying to get off the grid and coordinating gardens and security and preparing for what we regrettably anticipate as the collapse of modern industrial civilization (contributed to by climate change, population, and peak oil) and with it the global economy as it becomes increasingly clear that the voting public will not realize the gravity of these problems until after it is far too late (hate to be gloom and doom, but we're pragmatic realists).   We're also hoping to network with other like-minded people across the state and region well in advance of that in order to teach each other tradable skills we're learning and establish trade networks in advance.   

Our peculiar group thus far includes individuals in committed monogamist relationships and we would not identify as polyamorous and have thus far agreed to attempting to seek other like-minded individuals.  We do identify mostly as spiritual or non-religious, with most of us identifying as agnostic or atheist fascinated with the study of human cultures and religions, and many of us open to more eastern philosophies and not hostile to those with faith provided that it is not in conflict with our shared values of shared responsibility and sacrifice and we before me and people over profit.   Most of us thus far identify politically as liberals.   We've been disappointed to find mostly religious cultists or right wing militia types in our search for others who wish to prepare to create a transition town.

Unlike many preppers, we aren't gleefully excited for a day when we might have to protect resources from marauders or become mauraders ourselves in the exigency of our survival.  We'd rather prepare long in advance to create a cooperative prosocial community that necessarily must be ready to defend itself but is prepared to do so through numbers and preparation now and networking to ensure our families can survive catastrophic collapse of economy and modern industrial society, and would prefer to create infrastructure in our city that can avert the kind of desperation that might lead to that kind of violence in the first place.   

Our group would like to create a group of individuals beginning in this neighborhood (it's aging population creates the opportunity for a repurposing of the subdivision as an intentional community) that could survive a collapse while also purchasing land in a barren location with a deep well drilled, fertile soil trucked, and every member of our community having four-season trailers that could be used at this &quot;bug out&quot; community, with this neighborhood the location we've prepped for our return after things have settled down.  

We'd prefer that you are only a light/moderate/social user of any substance because substance abuse is inimical to group survival, and would also prefer if you have mental health conditions that you share those in full disclosure and not rely upon pharmaceutical solutions to cope with them.  We have an interest in learning aquaponics and coordinating cooperative food production in back and front yards and using rainwater catchment, and highly encourage solar and wind energy additions, installation of rocket mass heaters in all homes, and for each family who joins us to be involved in their own preparations for security and otherwise (we are not pacifist absolutists although we'd prefer to remain to be unless defense is necessary; we'd prefer to remain nonviolent).   

Finally, it's worth noting we're less than half a block away from Nancy English Park in Casper which could be used for community farming and greenhouses in the event of collapse and we as a community would work (as none of us are wealthy) to cooperate to buy materials for pallisades and for PVC greenhouses to ensure that between our yards and the park, we have sufficient fertile soil to feed our entire community.   Plus, due to the hill behind us, CY Ave, and the park and commmercial district, we have some natural boundaries that make this an ideal location to protect.   We should also note another thing that makes this location fairly ideal is that Garden Creek flows right next to it so we can be assured of drinking water and possibly irrigate some in the park.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23183&quot;&gt;Tribe of the Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The idea is to return to our home and rightful place among the living world and community of Mother Nature.
Leaving behind every thing that hinders this aim.  We are much more than this bag of muscles and bones.  Get in touch to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/tribe-of-the-multi-colored-phoenix/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/tribe-of-the-multi-colored-phoenix/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This community is a place for people to be real.  A place to rediscover what the essence of being human is.  We hold all life to be sacred and non-violence does not mean we just treat other humans well, but ALL other mammals, reptiles, fowl, and fish.  We are vegetarian and/or vegan and do not KILL ANY other animal for food.  It is time we acknowledge the capacity to love and communicate that resides in other living creatures.  It is also time we begin to reassume our lost, forgotten place in the circle of life as the species to bring understanding, harmony, peace, and love to all of Creation.

As such, our guidance comes from the Spirit of Love and Truth and Mother Nature.  We do not discriminate against, race, age, gender, sexual preferences, etc.  As a part of this community, members leave their religious, cultural predispositions, and traditions where they belong....  in the old, decaying fiction humanity as been tricked into living for millenia.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23186&quot;&gt;Whatevers Clever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To enjoy all that remote Alaska has to offer while still being just connected enough to the grid that we can participate in urban life when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/whatevers-clever/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/whatevers-clever/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I would like to organize an intentional sustainable community. I've been doing research for years in sustainable communities and I know so many people that just don't want to have to work 40 hours a week to move ahead. The technology required for completely self sufficient low cost living has moved leaps and bounds in the last few years with things like inexpensive and reliable solar panels and battery banks and integrated bio-system aquaponics etc etc.

It won't be difficult or expensive to build a complex of tiny home cabins on a large tract of land just far enough outside of a city so that a group of people could live together with a very low work input and very low cost. They could share a small condo in town with bunk beds for the 3 days or so a week they would each need to work in order to support their lives. Some could exist entirely though remote internet work or retirement income. I can design and build the entire infrastructure of the community and help maintain it. It's only a matter of finding the right 10 or 20 people. This is the initial stage of finding and organizing these people.

Farming will be done on the property in the summer and shared hunting and fishing trips. A large greenhouse will be constructed that is productive even in the dead of winter.

Anyone who wants to live off grid but doesn't have the entire spectrum of skills alone. It could be artists, woodsman, retired folks, people on disability that can still do simple chores around the greenhouse, pretty much anyone that wants to have a small inclusive community well outside of the over regulated cities.

No one says that this will be incredibly easy. It will be a combination of the skills and abilities of the people who choose to participate and the financial and other resources that they bring to the project. With the right people and skills and financing yes it could actually be easy.

I'm looking for more of a remote community that isn't ritzy but has all of the creature comforts.

There are methods to incorporate among a group of people that prevent every legal issue that you might be concerned about and have been used successfully over and over. You would get a legally enforceable fair share and no one can take your personal portion of the project. You could sell out at any time and the other members would have first right of refusal. Condominium and town home complexes are organized this way.

One of the central needs is to find an area or areas where the typical permitting issues simply don't exist. In the unincorporated boroughs of Alaska, you don't need permits for almost anything... Nearly anything goes and there are plenty of other places like this in the United States... There are already several of these communities in Alaska and others are popping up. Ideally I would like 2 locations. One in Alaska and one on the Big Island in Hawaii. People could stay in either location as their health and the weather dictates.</description>

We are also very interested in the idea of smaller housing or tiny housing but am flexible on those ideas. 

We would like to have a variety of individuals from older individuals to couples to families to foreign exchange students. 
Have not yet decided on the location or size of the community but we are located near Brooksville at this moment.

Please contact us with any questions we would love to get together with you and discuss your ideas as well and what we could do to move forward.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23190&quot;&gt;Poet's Plaggen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The house is dedicated to providing affordable workforce and student housing and growing our own food. We have surrounded the building with a 20-tree food forest as well as raised beds. Being a quiet community in a quiet neighborhood, we are dedicated to non-violent communication and lowering our environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/poets-plaggen/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/poets-plaggen/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Poet's Plaggen is a suburban homestead in a quiet golf course community. The name of the community is a play on words of the name of the neighborhood, Bardmoor. Since a moor refers to ancient boggy soil and the development is built on mostly sand, we decided to rename it plaggen - an extremely fertile anthropogenic soil. The house has a library, workshop, home office, pool, 5 bedrooms and two baths. We will be expanding to 7 bedrooms and 3 baths in the near future and eventually take the house off-grid.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23192&quot;&gt;unfolding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To meet the diverse needs of sensitive beings is our mission. We are all still unfolding… I would like to tell a story. A story of what might be, crafted by the ideas of children who believe nothing is impossible, their teachers, care givers, students, and those seeking they know not what. This story encompasses many whom have been drawn into the lives of an artistic, holistic caregiver who over analyzes everything, and an absolutely beautiful work of art we call Christophrax. Named by our Aspergian teen for describing ze whom is as varied as the moods of the sea, as the emotional, physical, spiritual tides of chronic pain, and living against all odds, sculpted by doctors, nurses, and a system which believes it is a caregiving system, but can not see it’s own limitations can create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/unfolding/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/unfolding/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;A not-for-profit intentional community focused around those of us who are sensitive, disabled, from overseas, those who have chosen to live more holistically. We are forming a community in Southern Illinois based upon sustainability, environmental care, self care, homeschooling, animal rescue, children's book writing, video game creating; expressing a whole, holistic view of an artistic expression of life. How an attitude of gratitude expresses itself in resilience, simple joys, following the flow of children, the disabled, rehabilitating a patient with patience.</description>

      <name>Phoenix Den</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23193&quot;&gt;Phoenix Den&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; An intentional community seeking to fill a gap in New York City for queer supportive housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/phoenix-den/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/phoenix-den/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Phoenix Den will provide supportive housing to LGBTQ+ people recovering from mental illness and co-occurring disorders. This is a community of people who are not in crisis and are currently sober, and have a strong drive towards living in recovery, but need some support maintaining a newfound stability. 

This community has 3 main facets it is trying to fulfill: queer supportive housing. With its LGBTQ+ focus, it will not be separated by gender, and people of any gender will be welcome to stay here. The space will not be cis-hetero-assuming, and LGBTQ+ resources will be made available. This is a factor that makes our form of supportive housing accessible to a community that is often left excluded from what are normally strictly gendered spaces. As a supportive community, we hope to foster independence and positive recovery from mental illness and co-occurring disorders. This will include providing a stable place to live, with shared food and cleaning and cooking schedules, as well as mental health resources such as weekly groups and various other support options. This is not meant to be a place of treatment, but rather a stepping stone to independent living (though permanent living is not an impossibility) for those who need help cementing their recovery. We hope to provide an affordable and accessible form of housing to people that would benefit from this vision.

Phoenix Den is meant to be a place of stability maintenance and recovery support. We are a group of people thoroughly invested in living our lives as best we can with the cards we have been dealt. The Phoenix is a mythical bird that is continuously reborn from its ashes. It carries with it a message of power and resilience, despite struggle, despite relapse, it carries everlasting strength and perseverance.</description>

      <name>Florida Homestead Botanical Gardens</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23194&quot;&gt;Florida Homestead Botanical Gardens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our efforts consist of practicing simple living, developing a close, harmonious relationship with the Earth and the cultivation and preservation of rare, threatened and endangered edible and medicinal plants, vegetables and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/florida-homestead-botanical-gardens/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/florida-homestead-botanical-gardens/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&quot;They paved paradise and put up a parking lot. We've got to get ourselves back to the garden.&quot; ~Joni Mitchell

&quot;In the past 70 years, 94% of the plants, vegetables and seeds we eat for food have become extinct. We have lost, and are now loosing, more plants, fish, birds and animals than in all other extinction events combined. We have entered the Anthropocene.&quot;

___________________________________________

Florida Homestead and Botanical Gardens is a private, off-grid, self-sustaining, 6 acre forest homestead community located in central Florida.

We are looking for established and enthusiastic Earth workers, who have a background in &quot;back to lander&quot; agriculture and have the &quot;soul&quot; desire to live simply and dedicate their lives to the preservation of rare and endangered plant species, practice ecological Earth based stewardship and live a non-consumer, carbon negative, communal lifestyle.

We are not a production farm, a CSA or a co-op. We are a private homestead that maintains gardens of rare and endangered plant species that need to be continually cultivated in order to survive. They are not sold, but simply maintained and protected. We do not accept visitors and are not open to the public.

We are a closed loop, self-sufficient, ecotopian, homestead community where virtually every aspect of modern life is holistically reexamined.

Interns will be engaged in maintaining the gardens, chickens, tilapia aquaculture systems, bee keeping, clearing new gardens, chopping wood, turning compost, mulching, weeding, green house maintenance, planting, grafting, gardening by moon phase, propagating and seed saving and to see first hand how it all functions in a self-sustaining, closed loop system.

We grow our own food, generate our own power, reuse waste water, make our own compost, potting soil and make, fix or repair most everything we need. There is no pay or stipend, but there is also no need for money here.

All lodging, meals, toiletries, utilities, laundry and wifi are provided. Periodically, long term interns will participate in plant shows or farmers markets and sell plants, soap, vegetables or art work if they need to generate additional income.

While here, interns will build and maintain: off-grid solar systems, mirco power grids, passive solar hot water heaters, 12 volt water systems, wind generator turbines, cisterns, wells, rainwater catchment systems, aquaculture systems, grey water systems, water filtration systems, irrigation systems and on site weather stations. A background or understanding of these systems is A+.

On the domestic side, interns are required to help with dishes, laundry, making meals, canning, fermenting, bread making, long term food preservation and general housekeeping.

This is Florida. The summers are hot and humid, we sweat and work the Earth. Maintaining clean and tidy living quarters and daily personal hygiene is required and mandatory.

We put high emphasis on re-skilling. We have a blacksmith shop, a home based foundry, a wood working shop, a welding and metal shop, an art studio, a fiber arts studio and a full service automotive and small engine repair shop complete with tools, a pit and lift.

Interns will learn blacksmithing, wood working, fiber arts, welding, plumbing, construction, tile and drywall, electrical and engine diagnosis and repair. Being &quot;mechanically inclined&quot;, having a understanding of construction and basic  hand and power tools is A+.

We also make our own medicinal soaps, salves, tinctures and practice holistic medicine. Having knowledge of medicinal plants is A+.

We also have a number of looms, spinning wheels and treadle sewing machines. Interns are encouraged to build their own tri-looms, weave shawls, do art and make their own clothes from recycled materials. Being artistic and having a background in fiber arts and knowing how to use a sewing machine is A+.

Computers, video games, televisions, radios and ear buds are prohibited. Cell phone use is limited to personal communication and research only. It is important to understand the environmental, health and societal impact of these kinds of devices.

We do have wifi and decent cell service here. We also have a video CD player and have weekly &quot;popcorn and movie nights&quot; consisting of documentaries on Earth climate issues, pollution, organic farming and simple living.

We have two &quot;clean&quot; shelters for interns. A primitive guest cabin for short timers and an intern apartment that has a full bathroom, shower, wood stove, fireplace and kitchen. We also have two RV sites with hookups and a full outdoor kitchen with fire pit.

This is a &quot;farmily&quot; setting and a private residence. We only accept happy, peaceful, loving, harmonious people that want to live and learn in a quiet, forest based, communal setting.

If you are indeed longing to reintegrate with the Web of Life. If you understand the importance of a non-consumer, self-reliant, zero waste lifestyle. If you have a longing to unplug from the material matrix, move to a forest, grow your own food, cultivate rare and endangered plants, be artistic and live a quiet, peaceful, harmonious, ecotopian, communal forest lifestyle with like-minded people, then, and with mettā, Ewha has heard you... Welcome home!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/organizations/23196&quot;&gt;Briarwood Haven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To sustain a healing environment and cultivate learning through expirence and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/briarwood-haven/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/briarwood-haven/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;My husband and I are homesteaders just getting started. The hope for our community is to be a place of learning and healing. 
     There isn’t a plan written in stone, because come what may, but here are a few things we would like to build and invite others to come help:
An active rotating field of livestock and annual vegetables
Buildings using clay slip and straw
A large space for creative work and dance
A permaculture forest garden
Hospice for our elders
Foster care for children
Offer work trades for travelers

     We are on 10 acres, half forest and half field. 
We have all our permits for building our first dwelling, which we had an architect design for code. It’s clay and timber framed and the build begins next year (2019).
      It’s been such a mad scramble since we bought the land that we haven’t been able to work it or put seed down, hopefully that can happen next year too.
     Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to exchange labor or need a place to stay in the area.</description>
