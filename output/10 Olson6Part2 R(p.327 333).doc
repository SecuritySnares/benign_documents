In the past, computer security remained a constant race between increased exposure of threats on one hand, and improving policies and technologies to combat them on the other. Over the past 20 years, we\rquote ve witnessed numerous business re-engineering efforts, these efforts led to higher interest levels in computer security and resulted in additional functions of computer security applications. Examples include: access controls, electronic banking controls, security evaluation certification centers, anti-virus technology and distributed environments. These advances were mostly driven by the IT departments of Corporate America who were responsible for mitigating risk of the data center. But, not the cloud\rquote s.

The problem is that this information arena will probably include much that we do not wish to share with everyone.

That is the information highway now appears to be safe, but are the application and database servers that connect to the information highway safe? Corporations that undertake to provide primary database services on the information highway and provide security and reten\-tion of cloud computing need to address the issue of retention and security of housing digital data in the cloud besides its safe secure transport. 
\ulnone\strike0\par\pard\s8\s3\sa52\fi180\qj\sl240\slmult0\fs22 A primary method used to address protection of \fs22 data is encryption.

For example, a simple fact from the mid 1990s was that loss of a cryptographic key used for encryption meant loss of the data.

What in the world are we going to do if we do not have paper backup? Where will we find the originals? Using electronic records in replacing paper backup may make the future very different. What will be the new paper backup procedures, how will we authenticate, and will there be paper trails? For example the validity of the computer researches notebooks, or the validity of electronic records for the patent office. Just how do we replace the paper world? We have been working on these issues for years and now we will complicate the issues with globalized digital data and records. 
\ulnone\strike0\par\pard\s8\fi0\qj\sl240\slmult0\fs22 The current practices of using computers and hav\-ing paper backups for security may have resulted in bearable risks, but what happens when all we have are electronic records? For example in combination, SEC Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 require broker-dealers to create, and preserve in an easily accessible manner, a comprehensive record of each securities transac\-tion they effect and of their securities business in general. These requirements were integral to the Commission\rquote s investor protection function because the preserved records were the primary means of monitoring compliance with applicable securities laws, including antifraud provisions and financial responsibility standards. Recent events involving Wall Street have affirmed the need to have measures in place to protect record integrity.

On USA\rquote s SEC Example of Risk Management for Security Records \b0\ulnone\strike0\par\pard\s8\s3\sa52\fi180\qj\sl240\slmult0\cf0\fs22\f2 A close look at the USA\rquote s Securities and Exchange (SEC) solution to records integrity and maybe we can learn some for our cloud providers. In a letter from Mr. Michael D. Udoff in 1992, of the Securities Industry Association to the SEC, he noted that until 1970, paper was the sole medium for the preservation of Broker and Dealer (B/D) records, and in 1970 the commission amended the rule to permit microfilm, and in 1979 further amended to permit microfiche. In this letter, he has requested that the SEC Commis\-sion take no action if brokers and dealers maintain the required records only on optical disk storage and follow the requirements (outlined in his letter) for replacement of microfilm as backup. 
\ulnone\strike0\par\pard\s8\s3\sa52\fi180\qj\sl240\slmult0\fs22 In 1997, the Commission amended paragraph (f) of Rule 17a-4 to allow broker-dealers to store records \fs22{\sl240\slmult0 electronically.}\fs10\super\up8\fs22 3 \up0\nosupersub\fs22\fs22 The rule, by its terms, does not limit broker-dealers to using a particular type of technology such as optical disk. Instead, it allows them to em\-ploy any electronic storage media, subject to certain requirements, including that the media \ldblquote preserve the records exclusively in a non-rewriteable, non\-erasable format.\rdblquote  This requirement does not mean that the records must be preserved indefinitely. Like paper and microfilm, electronic records need only be maintained for the relevant retention period specified in the rule. See Exhibit A at the back of this article for salient parts of this ruling. Please note the bold and highlighted sections for requirements beyond just a \ldblquote backup\rdblquote  copy. These sections deal with duplicate, verifiable, non-destructive, audited, escrowed, and third party access. Wow! So as we move to only digital data, what from the SEC might we learn? 
\ulnone\strike0\par\pard\s8\sa395\fi180\qj\sl240\slmult0\fs22 Electronic archiving of records and databases has similar issues to the SEC. For example, one of the primary concerns is that the technology used in the future may not be compatible with current logical records and/or physical media. How many of you have a 5 \'BC inch floppy disk system? Archive (and backup) procedures for records, indexes and computer sys\-tems on behalf of a business entity is a complex issue and ideally addresses controlled access to retained materials and the audit of the corresponding software system so that the entity\rquote s electronic records are valu\-able and can be retrieved. In some situations, such as the SEC, the archival guidelines also must provide for an escrow agent\rquote s administrative, operational and technical system\rquote s integrity or the electronic opera\-

\ulnone\strike0\par\pard\s8\s3\sa52\fi0\qj\sl240\slmult0\fs22 Another important issue that must also be ad\-dressed is the maintenance of the sanctity and readability of the records when those records are dependent on particular and ephemeral technologies and software packages. In the absence of general and widely-accepted standards for the maintenance of long-lived electronic archives, procedures, for example, archiving of hardware and software, secure forward copying, 
\i\fs22\f3 etc.\i0\fs22\f2 , must be defined to ensure that records remain secure and readable for a speci\-fied future period and, if necessary, indefinitely. For example, a business entity that uses electronic commerce would be required to archive a variety of records/documents, will generally fall into two categories: journalizing the records and actions rela\-tive to the integrity, such as in the security of the system itself, and the records that individual users engaging in their future use or protection. 
\ulnone\strike0\par\pard\s8\fi0\qj\sl240\slmult0\fs22 There are a variety of reasons why some electronic commerce information would be archived. A few of these critical areas include but are not limited to, dispute resolution, conformance with legal require\-ments, tax audit, SEC compliance, banking records, historical purposes, scientific research, documents having continuing or future legal effect, wills, trusts, life estates, prevention of fraud (clinical and engi\-neering testing, priority of invention and discovery). Many issues are yet to be discussed, but some are: ability to retrieve at some distant point in time, use\-fulness, access control, distributed archival, index\-ing, compatibility of equipment/formats, standards, archival authority, quality or level of service.

The current version of the ICANN Registrar Accreditation Agreement (\ldblquote RAA\rdblquote ) obliges registrars to periodically submit a copy of their registration database to ICANN or a mutually-approved third-party escrow agent. This escrowed data could be used by another registrar assigned by ICANN (or even temporarily by ICANN itself) to continue the provision of registrar services to the customers of a registrar whose accreditation is terminated or expires without renewal.

Archiving in the cloud has been rapidly growing in popularity, offering a number of benefits, which are attractive to companies of all sizes and all industries. These benefits are especially important in these times of tighter budgets, shrinking IT teams, and increased email volume. However, security and legal compliance of cloud solutions continues to be an area of concern. Then again, who owns and who is responsible and for what? How about what the providers say about retention? Where are health care records going?

At the same time, the informa\-tion needs of consumers have been largely ignored. Consumers want access and control of their health-care records. Today, Personal Health Record systems (PHRs) like Microsoft\rquote s HealthVault enable people to track some information on their own, but there is almost no access to the records stored by provid\-ers. The government is spending an unprecedented amount (over $25B just in ARRA/HITECH funds) in the current budget to make ubiquitous EHRs and HIEs a reality. However, HIEs will need to generate

To be able to aggregate data yet to protect the secrecy of each original owner has great value. Mined and aggregated data has value, the key is to know how to protect and license appropriately. If we permit mining via license can we in the reverse license or contract that data will not be mined? In the energy service sector, the customer does not have enough data to be statistically valuable or possibly valid. Validity and value may only come when com\-bined with other customer\rquote s data. Aggregation has value in the context of clinical health and also in oil and gas production to name just a few. Cloud comput\-ing \ldblquote lets\rdblquote  the service provider mine data, but how do we deal with ownership, recovery, control and value propositions. Cloud computing only makes these is\-sues more complex with loss of direct physical access over the data. We need to think clearly about the issues and perhaps include new terms in our \ldblquote cloud licenses\rdblquote  just as ICANN did. Maybe we should think about data as \ldblquote trade secrets\rdblquote  or provide provisions for third party audit (similar to a financial auditor) that monitors integrity.
