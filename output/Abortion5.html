<p><b><font size="+1">8.&nbsp; A Critical Evaluation of the
Potentialities Version of the Central Anti-Abortion Argument</font></b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our preliminary
examination of different versions of the central anti-abortion argument
we identified two versions that seemed especially worthy of closer
examination.&nbsp;
In the previous lecture we considered the biological version of the
argument, and we saw that it is open to decisive objections.&nbsp; In
this lecture
I shall consider the potentialities version of the argument. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way of formulating
this version of the argument is as follows: </p>
<p><b>(l) All innocent organisms that have the potential to acquire the
capacity for thought and self-consciousness have a serious right to
life.</b><b></b> </p>
<p><b>(2) It is at least prima facie very seriously wrong to kill
anything which possesses a serious right to life.</b><b></b> </p>
<p><b>(3) Therefore it is at least prima facie very seriously wrong to
kill an innocent organism that has the potential to acquire the
capacity for thought and
self-consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[From (1) and (2)]</b><b></b> </p>
<p><b>(4) Any human fetus, embryo, or zygote is itself an innocent
organism that has the potential to acquire the capacity for thought and
self-consciousness.</b><b></b> </p>
<p><b>(5) Therefore it is at least prima facie very seriously wrong to
kill a human fetus, embryo, or zygote.</b> <br>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[From (3) and (4)]</b><b></b> </p>
<p><b>(6) Abortion involves the killing of a human fetus, embryo, or
zygote.</b><b></b> </p>
<p><b>(7) Therefore abortion is at least prima facie very seriously
wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[From (5) and (6)]</b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our preliminary
examination of the potentialities version of the argument, we noticed
that that argument would not show that abortion is always prima facie
wrong in itself.&nbsp;
The reason is that the premise that is introduced at step (4) in that
version of the argument - namely: <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote><b>Any human fetus, embryo, or zygote is itself an innocent
organism that has the potential to acquire the capacity for thought and
self-consciousness</b></blockquote>
<p><br>
is false.&nbsp; For some fetuses are anencephalic, or else have brains
that are so defective that they can never support the capacity for
thought and self-consciousness, and such humans, therefore, do not
possess the potentiality in question. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, while this shows
that the argument in question cannot support the extreme anti-abortion
position, the argument, if it were not otherwise defective, could be
modified to support a conclusion of great scope and interest, and one
that would refute all liberal positions on abortion, and almost all
moderate positions.&nbsp; For the argument would establish the
following, very important conclusion: <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote><b>(7*) Abortion is at least prima facie very seriously
wrong, except where the embryo or fetus in question is anencephalic, or
suffers
from certain very severe brain defects.</b></blockquote>
<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us consider, then,
whether the argument is otherwise sound or not.&nbsp; Here the crucial
question is whether the first premise in the argument is true or false:
<br>
&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote><b>All innocent organisms that have the potential to
acquire the capacity for thought and self-consciousness have a serious
right to
life.</b></blockquote>
<p><br>
<b><font size="+1">8.1 The Question of Potentialities</font></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen that a
crucial question that must be answered before one can definitely settle
the issue of the moral status of abortion is whether potentialities by
themselves
suffice to give something a right to life.&nbsp; As the importance of
this
question was not really noticed until around the early 1970s, one
cannot
find many arguments bearing upon this issue in the great ethical
theorists
of the past.&nbsp; Since the early 1970s, however, a variety of
arguments
have been offered on both sides of this issue, and I shall briefly
sketch,
and comment upon, the more important of these in what follows. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">8.2&nbsp; Arguments in Support of an Affirmative
Answer</font></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four main arguments have
been offered in support of the view that potentialities can in
themselves give something a right to life, or, at least, can make the
destruction of something just as seriously wrong as the killing of a
normal, innocent, adult human being. </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Argument 1:&nbsp; Comas and Potentialities</font></b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thrust of this first
argument is that while it is not wrong to kill a person who has
suffered
upper brain death, and who thus is in an irreversible coma, it is wrong
to
kill someone in a temporary coma.&nbsp; It is then suggested that the
difference between the two cases is a matter of potentialities, and
thus that potentialities do give something a right to life. </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Critical Comments</font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">1.&nbsp; Active versus Passive Potentialities</font></b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who advances the
potentialities version of the anti-abortion argument has to draw a
distinction between active potentialities and passive potentialities,
where this distinction is roughly as follows: </p>
<p>X has an <b><u>active</u></b> potentiality for the acquisition of
property P </p>
<p>means </p>
<p>All of the positive causal factors that are required for a process
that would give rise to the possession of property P are present in X. </p>
<p>X has a <b><u>passive</u></b> potentiality for the acquisition of
property P </p>
<p>means </p>
<p>There is something that could be done to X that would initiate a
process that would give rise to the possession of property P. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why must an advocate of
the potentialities version of the anti-abortion argument draw this
distinction?&nbsp;
One reason will emerge when we consider an argument, advanced by Mary
Anne Warren, for the view that potentialities do not in themselves
provide the basis of a right to life, since we shall see that it is
only by drawing
a distinction between active and passive potentialities that any
response
to Warren's argument is possible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one can also see, in
a direct fashion, why that distinction is needed.&nbsp; For consider a
spermatozoon and an unfertilized human egg cell.&nbsp; If these are
brought together, and then placed in an appropriate environment, the
eventual result will be an individual with the capacity for thought and
self-consciousness.&nbsp;
The combination of a spermatozoon and an unfertilized human egg cell
(plus a uterus) therefore has the potentiality of giving rise to an
individual
with the capacity for thought and self-consciousness.&nbsp;
Accordingly,
if it were very seriously wrong to destroy such a potentiality, it
would
be very seriously wrong to destroy an unfertilized human egg
cell.&nbsp;
The latter, however, is surely not true.&nbsp; Consequently, what the
advocate
of the potentialities argument must say is that while it is wrong to
destroy
active potentialities, it is not wrong - or, at least, not nearly as
wrong
- to destroy passive potentialities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now the problem is
that the argument based upon the case of the comatose individual shows
too much, for if that case really showed that active potentialities by
themselves endow something with a right to life, it would also show
that passive potentialities do so as well.&nbsp; For consider the case
of a person who is in a coma,
and who will never come out of it on his or her own, but who would
recover
if a certain operation were performed.&nbsp; Killing such a human being
would be just as seriously wrong as killing the person who is in a
temporary coma from which he or she will emerge without
assistance.&nbsp; So if the case of the comatose individual showed that
potentialities by themselves give something
right to life, it would show that passive potentialities also do this. </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">2.&nbsp; Potentialities, or the Persistence of
Memory and/or Personality?</font></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what, then, is going
on in the case of the comatose individual?&nbsp; The answer is that in
that case more is present than just certain potentialities, either
active or passive.&nbsp; For the individual's brain contains the
physical basis of his or her memories, and of his or her personality
traits.&nbsp; In short, the states that make for personal identity are
present in the brain of the comatose individual, and, because of this,
what is present is not just a general potentiality for
the existence of an individual who is capable of thought and
self-consciousness: there is also the potentiality for the continued
existence of the person who
enjoyed thought and self-consciousness in the past, and it is this that
makes
the killing of such an individual seriously wrong. </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Argument 2:&nbsp; Potentialities and an Entity's
Intrinsic Value</font></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle underlying
this second argument is this: <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote><b>The value of an entity is related to the values of the
things into which it may develop, taking into account the relevant
probabilities.</b></blockquote>
<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since, then, a fetus has a
reasonable chance of developing into a normal, adult person, its value
must be reasonably close to that of an adult person. </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Critical Comment</font></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One needs to distinguish
between destroying something that has value - where something has value
if it makes the world a better place - and destroying something that,
though it need not make the world a better place, does have a right to
life.&nbsp;
The above principle relates to value, not to rights.&nbsp; What would
be
needed, then, for the argument would be something like the following
principle: <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote><b>The extent to which an entity possesses a given right R
is related to the extent to which the things into which it may develop
possess right R, taking into account the relevant probabilities.</b> <br>
  <b></b>&nbsp;</blockquote>
But as will be clear from the Generalized Potentialities Argument to be
set out below, this principle is clearly false.
<p><b><font size="+1">Argument 3:&nbsp; Potentialities and Infanticide</font></b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If potentialities do not
give an entity a right to life, and something like capacities are
necessary,
then a fetus will not have a right to life, but neither will a newborn
baby,
since a newborn baby does not have those capacities that give something
a
right to life - such as the capacities for thought and
self-consciousness.&nbsp;
So infanticide will not be morally wrong - which surely cannot be
correct.&nbsp;
Therefore, potentialities must give something a right to life. </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Critical Comments</font></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who advance this
argument usually assume that one can establish the claim that
infanticide is morally wrong simply by appealing to one's moral
intuitions.&nbsp; There are two questions that one needs to ask about
such an appeal.&nbsp; First, as we saw earlier, there are reasons for
thinking that an appeal to moral intuitions is appropriate only in the
case of basic moral principles.&nbsp; For if a principle is derived,
one should be able to set out the derivation, and then ask whether the
basic principle in question is supported by one's moral
intuitions.&nbsp; But mightn't the claim that human infanticide is
wrong itself be a basic moral principle?&nbsp; Not if basic moral
principles
should be free of all reference to physical properties, such as species
membership. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point arises
from the fact that anthropologists have claimed that, in the past,
infanticide
was accepted in at least some circumstances by most societies.&nbsp; It
seems,
then, that the intuitions that are being appealed to in this argument
are
by no means universally shared.&nbsp; This in turn leads to the
question of what grounds one has for holding that it is one's own
intuitions that
are correct on this matter. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upshot is that
further argument is needed if this line of argument can be sustained. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A different response to
this argument is advanced by Mary Anne Warren in the "Postscript" to
her article, "On the Moral and Legal Status of Abortion".&nbsp; Warren
attempts to show that there are consequentialist objections against
infanticide that do not apply - or that do not apply with equal force -
to abortion. </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Argument 4:&nbsp; Consequentialism, and the Value
of Additional Happy People</font></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final argument
appeals to certain forms of consequentialism - where consequentialism
is the
view that the right action is the one that will result in the best
balance of desirable states over undesirable states.&nbsp; The basic
idea, then, is
that if a fetus has an active potentiality for acquiring the capacity
for
thought and self-consciousness, then that is also a potentiality for
the
existence of an individual who is likely to be happy.&nbsp; Other
things being equal, then, it is wrong to destroy such a potentiality,
since the
world is likely to be one that contains less happiness. </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Critical Comments</font></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many things to
be said about this argument.&nbsp; Many philosophers, for example, hold
that consequentialism is not a satisfactory ethical theory.&nbsp;
Others, who are consequentialists, maintain that what has value is not
the addition of happiness to the world, but the addition of happiness
to individuals
who already exist.&nbsp; The main point to be made in the present
context,
however, is, I think, that this line of argument would prove much more
than
anti-abortionists are likely to want to accept.&nbsp; Thus it would
also
show, for example, that destroying a passive potentiality is just as
seriously
wrong as destroying an active potentiality, and, consequently, that
intentionally
refraining from reproducing is just as seriously wrong as having an
abortion. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">8.3&nbsp; Arguments in Support of a Negative
Answer</font></b> </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Argument 1: Mary Anne Warren's Cloning Argument</font></b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her article "On the
Moral and Legal Status of Abortion", Mary Anne Warren has argued that
if potentialities gave something a right to life, then every cell in
one's body would have a right to life, since if the nucleus of such a
cell were to be transferred to an unfertilized human egg cell from
which the nucleus had been removed, the resulting cell would develop in
exactly the same way that a fertilized human egg cell develops. </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Comments</font></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I noted above, the
anti-abortionist will respond by drawing a distinction between active
potentialities and passive potentialities.&nbsp; This provides a way of
blocking Warren's argument, but it is far from clear that it is
satisfactory.&nbsp; For the question immediately arises as to whether
the distinction between active potentialities and passive
potentialities is really morally significant - a question that is
raised&nbsp; in a very vivid way by the "almost active" potentialities
argument that follows.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most clear cut objection,
however, to the attempt to answer Mary Anne Warren&#8217;s &#8220;cloning argument&#8221;
by appealing to the distinction between active potentialities and
passive potentialities is provided by the case of the comatose
individual.&nbsp; For while that case is an unsound argument for the
view that <span style="font-weight: bold;">general</span>
potentialities &#8211; such as the potentiality for acquiring the capacity
for thought &#8211; i<span style="font-weight: bold;">n themselves</span> can
be the basis for a right to life, what the comatose case does show is
that when potentialities of certain sorts are relevant to the right to
life, it is <span style="font-weight: bold;">both</span> active
potentialities and passive potentialities that are relevant.&nbsp; So
the attempt to respond to Mary Anne Warren&#8217;s argument by distinguishing
between active potentialities and passive potentialities, and claiming
that only the former are morally significant, cannot be sound.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Argument 2:&nbsp; The "Almost Active"
Potentialities Argument</font></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thrust of this
argument is, first, that a fertilized human egg cell on its own - e.g.,
in a test tube - will not develop into a person, and so it does not in
fact have
an active potentiality for giving rise to an entity with the capacity
for
thought and self-consciousness: its potentiality is, at best, an
"almost active" one.&nbsp; But then, secondly, consider the combination
of an unfertilized ovum lying next to a spermatozoon.&nbsp; This
combination is almost comparable to an isolated fertilized human egg
cell with respect to its "almost active" potentiality.&nbsp; For, in
the former case, one needs to transfer the fertilized human egg cell to
a uterus, whereas, in the latter case, one merely needs to combine the
two, and then transfer the result to a uterus.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Given the small difference with respect to what must be done to produce
a fully active potentiality, can there really be a great moral gulf
here? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This point can be
reinforced, moreover, by a different comparison, namely that between
(1) an
unfertilized ovum lying right next to a spermatozoon, both of them
inside a uterus, and (2) a fertilized human egg cell that is far
removed from any human uterus.&nbsp; Now it is the former situation
that seems to involve a
more nearly active potentiality, and so if potentialities count to the
extent
that they are nearly active, then destruction of the potentiality
involved
in (1) should be morally worse than destroying the potentiality
involved
in (2).&nbsp; Destruction of the potentiality involved in situation
(1),
however, is not seriously wrong.&nbsp; So neither is destruction of the
potentiality
involved in situation (2) seriously wrong. </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Argument 3:&nbsp; Artificial Wombs and the
Generalized Potentiality Argument</font></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If active potentialities
give something a right to life, then it would seem that the presence of
any active potentiality for giving rise to an entity with the capacity
for
thought and self-consciousness must mean that there is something that
it
is wrong to destroy, regardless of exactly how the potentiality is
realized.&nbsp;
That is to say, given any situation that will, if not interfered with,
give rise to a person, it must be wrong to interfere, and to prevent a
being possessing the capacity for thought and self-consciousness from
coming into being.&nbsp; But it turns out that there are situations
that will, if not interfered with, give rise to such an entity, but
where very few people think it would be seriously
wrong to prevent a person from coming into being.&nbsp; Consider, for
example,
situations where one has a spermatozoon and a unfertilized ovum, and
where,
in addition, the situation is such that there are factors that causally
ensure
that the ovum will be fertilized by the spermatozoon, and that the
resulting
zygote will then develop normally, so that the ultimate result, if the
system
is not interfered with, will be a normal adult human being.&nbsp; Given
such
a situation, very few people would hold that it is seriously wrong to
shut
down the system before fertilization takes place, thus causing the
spermatozoon
and the unfertilized ovum to perish.&nbsp; But such an action would
destroy
an active potentiality for the acquisition of a capacity for thought
and
self-consciousness. Consequently, the destruction of an active
potentiality
for the acquisition of a capacity for thought and self-consciousness
cannot
be seriously wrong. </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">Argument 4:&nbsp; The Rights and Interests
Argument</font></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the functions of
rights?&nbsp; According to this final argument, the function of rights
is to protect corresponding&nbsp; interests.&nbsp; But what sorts of
beings can have interests?&nbsp; A plausible answer is that only
something that
either now has, or has had in the past, desires, can now have
interests.&nbsp;
But if this is correct, then a fertilized human egg cell does not have
interests, and so does not have rights, and this in turn implies that
mere potentialities do not give something a right to life. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><b><font size="+1">8.4&nbsp; Summing Up:&nbsp; The Potentialities
Argument Against Abortion</font></b> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crucial question with
regard to this version of the central anti-abortion argument is whether
potentialities by themselves suffice to give something a right to
life.&nbsp;
I have considered a number of arguments on both sides, and we have
seen,
I believe, that all of the arguments for the view that potentialities
do
give something a right to life are open to strong objections.&nbsp; By
contrast, there are a number of very plausible arguments for the view
that potentialities by themselves do not suffice to give something a
right to life - arguments that have, on the whole, not even been
addressed by defenders of potentiality arguments against
abortion.&nbsp; Unless significant objections can be mounted against
those arguments, the potentiality version of the central anti-abortion
argument must be set aside as unsound. <br>
