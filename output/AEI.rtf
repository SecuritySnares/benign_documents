\par }{\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 The interpretation of Adorno\rquote s philosophy I offer here is shaped by two problems: the problem of the availability of the good, which bears on Adorno\rquote 
s ethics and social theory, and the problem of the consistency of Adorno\rquote s ethics with the central tenets of his philosophical negativism. I show that there is a way of construing the relation between the ineffable and the ethical in Adorno\rquote 
s philosophy, which provides an account of the availability of the good that is compatible with his philosophical negativism. }{\f40\fs20\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 Naturally this is not a freestanding argument. }{
\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 It is an interpretation, one that is constrained by what I consider to be the most important, central and characteristic claims of Adorno\rquote s philosophy. The ancillar
y aim of this article is to take issue with a prevalent line of interpretation maintaining that Adorno\rquote s philosophy needlessly embraces paradox and aporia and thus lapses into irrationalism and mysticism.}{

By this thesis Adorno means above all that in a false world there is no way of doing (and no way of knowing we are doing) the morally or politically right thing. Rational subjects cannot be sure that even apparently harmless or valuable activ

\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903  There are just vario

world has come to exist for the sake of something else. This is the state of affairs that Adorno calls \lquote universal fungibility\rquote . (PDM 228) What appear to be ends in themselves \endash 
 say cultural activities and intellectual pursuits - have been annexed by all-per
vasive forms of economy and administration and turned into mere means for the attainment of self-preservation. In sum, Adorno holds that in the modern, late-capitalist world nothing is good in itself save the end of self-preservation, and whatever is valu
able is only instrumentally valuable for the control of nature and for self-preservation. (DA 9-48) Finally, we should note the implication of this thesis that, properly speaking, }{\i\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 life}{

This thesis is easy to misunderstand. Adorno does not claim that the social world is evil because it led to the death camps. True, Auschwitz, and all it stands for (MCP 101 & 104) is a central theme of Adorno\rquote s social phil
osophy and he often intimates that any culture which allowed such appalling things to happen must be deeply flawed. However, Auschwitz is only a very vivid and horrible example of the radical evil of the social world - the commodification and bureaucratis
ation of genocide. Other examples include the atom bomb and the Vietnam war (MCP}{\b\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903  }{\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 101,104,116).
\par Equally, it is a mistake to think that this is an exaggerated way of stating that bourgeois capitalism is iniquitous. Adorno is a Marxist and believes that capita
lism - the process of the reification of things and persons by which concrete use-values are reduced to abstract exchange-values - is nefarious.  However, he departs from Marx insofar as he holds that capitalism is only symptomatic of a more fundamental e
vil. For Adorno, the underlying cause of radical evil is not socio-economic: it resides in the form of rationality itself.}{\cs17\f40\fs20\super\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 \chftn {\footnote\ftnalt \pard\plain

\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903  A similar consideration seems to underlie Adorno\rquote s view that the context of universal fungibility - socially sedimented instrumental ra
tionality  - is a kind of institutionalised pattern of unfreedom. That said, Adorno\rquote s suspicion of instrumental reasoning is even more radical than Kant\rquote s. Kant subscribes roughly to Aristotle\rquote 
s definition of the human being as a rational animal and understands the rationality of persons  - and not their animality - as the locus of their moral value. Kant is suspicious of instrumental rationality, because in his view it is subservient to man

nt as the accumulation of knowledge that is useful for the purpose of mastering the external world (DA 9-48).

 things as tokens of more general types fixes and stabilizes meanings, rendering them more useful for the purpose of predicting and controlling nature. Adorno believes that this is the basic process behind the process of reification, i.e. the domination o
f use-values by exchange-values that is characteristic of the commodity form (HTS 100).
\par \tab So, unlike Kant, Adorno does not conceive instrumental rationality along standard lines as a kind of rationality or reasoning that is distinguished from other kinds of 
rationality or reasoning by virtue of its content, i.e. by its being reasoning about means. Nor is it the case that there is another kind of rationality or reasoning (reasoning about ends) that is exempt from suspicion. According to Adorno the concept is 
itself \lquote the organon of thinking\rquote , the purpose of which is to tame and subdue the external world in the interest of self-preservation (ND 27).  For \lquote concepts on their part are moments of the reality [universal fungibility \endash

 Although this intuition of the awfulness of social reality is not the m

There are several difficulties with this view. For one thing, suppose we grant that the social world is indeed radically evil, it still is not a promising basis for a normative ethics. The mere prevention of \lquote barbarism\rquote , to borrow Adorno
\rquote s term, leaves too much open and provides none of the constraints on individual action we typically expect from a normative ethical theory. Against this, we must remember that Adorno is of the view th

 stands as a kind of absolute moral minimum that must be striven for whatever else can or cannot be achieved (CM 199-204). 
\par But there is a second, much deeper worry. On this interpretation, the ethics of resistance provides little or no practical orientation to the present, for it appears to ask us to resist everything at once. What can total resistance amount to, prac
tically speaking, apart from total inactivity? This worry is a serious one, and it lends credence to the popular caricature of Adorno as a mandarin aesthete who provided himself with very clever excuses for retreating from the world of action and resignin

  As a matter of fact this caricature is unfair. Adorno thought an ethics of resistance appropriate to the modern world precisely because it contained so many developments that were 
worth resisting. Contrary to his own caricature, he was himself prodigiously active throughout his career as a journalist, music critic, radio broadcaster, university lecturer and philosopher. Look closely and one can see that each of these pursuits was i
n
 itself a form of resistance. For example he took a very keen interest in the question of education. One of his functions after the war was to conduct an oral examination of future high-school teachers. He was extremely concerned that the examination fulf
i
l its aim of testing the ability of candidates to reflect on the wider culture significance of the philosophy they had studied, rather than simply testing memorized facts about what a particular philosopher had written (CM 19-35). In his public lectures A
dorno developed the controversial view that the model of psychoanalytic reflection might aid the formation of school children into independent-minded adults, and prevent their being schooled into a mentality of passive acceptance and norm-conformism.}{

\par If we take Adorno\rquote s ow

s negativism, tha
t the social world is radically evil. There must be something positive, some reliable values in virtue of which these acts of resistance are to be performed. It would be self-defeating for Adorno to ground an ethics of resistance simply on the extant nega
tive value of the social world. We have already seen that an ethics of resistance presupposes at least the virtues of }{\i\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 M\'fcndigkeit}{\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 
, modesty and affection. Adorno cannot claim that what makes these virtues, or their exercise, good or right, is merely that they
 somehow resist the extant evil of the social world, that they hinder the course of that world or prevent its reproduction. For that would imply that acts of }{\i\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 M\'fcndigkeit}{

 is consistent with the three central theses. Adorno faces a dilemma: either he avails himself of some positive conception of goodness or rightness and gives up his philosophical negativism, or he remains resolutely negativistic and loses the moral dimens

For this reason, Nicholas, unlike the Scholastics, does not try to establish the existence of God. Rather he assumes that God, the infinite being, exists. The point of his inquiry is to proceed anyway, cognizant of the fact that finite 
categories necessarily fail to grasp God\rquote s infinite being, in order to discover, through the failure to reveal God\rquote 
s essence, something important about the limits of human knowledge. The doctrine of epistemological modesty that emerges applies not just to knowledge of God\rquote 
s infinite being, but to all knowledge including knowledge of finite beings. Nicholas states that \lquote the intellect, which is not truth, never comprehends truth so precisely that truth cannot be comprehended infinitely more precisely.\rquote  (OLI 1
, 3) He compares the relation between our finite intellect and the truth with the relation between an inscribed polygon and an inscribed circle. The resemblance between the polygon and the circle grows with the multiplication of the angles of the polygon.
 
However no multiplication of the angles of the polygon, however great, will make the polygon equal the circle. [Fig 1] Later Nicholas uses an even more suggestive analogy, which concerns one of the paradoxes of the infinitely large. Take a circle of any d
iameter you care. As the length of the diameter increases, so the arc on the circumference decreases. When you extend the diameter to infinity, the arc of the circumference is no different to a straight line. [Fig. 2]

 The necessity for a mystical encounter with God is supposed to provide evidence for an ineffable truth contained in the symbolic and mysterious doctrines of revealed religion. These intended conclusions are illegitimate anyway; they do not follow
 from the doctrine of ignorance. The real point of interest here, the salient point of the comparison with Adorno, is the legitimate conclusion to which Nicholas is entitled. What we acquire and learn from the paradoxes in which the attempt to think God

 to claim that ineffable knowledge is inherently valuable? Once again Moore provides a general argument that can help Adorno out. In very broad strokes, knowledge is among ot
her things a dispositional state which explains purposive activity. States of knowledge are instrumentally valuable insofar as they are dispositions to act in ways that deliver goods to knowers by satisfying their desires. Assume that all representational
 knowledge (\lquote knowledge that\rquote 
 or what Adorno calls identifying knowledge) is effable. Representational knowledge has certain essential features which ineffable knowledge does not, one of which is transparency. When one reflects on states of effable knowledge
 one can see through them to the goods that, other things being equal, they deliver, by enabling the knower to satisfy her desires. To know something effably entails that one can come to know what that knowledge is good for. Ineffable knowledge is not tra
n
sparent in this way; it is opaque. When one self-consciously reflects on it, only the state of  knowledge itself  comes into view. What this means is that the good that a state of ineffable knowledge delivers is nothing but the good of being in that state
. It follows that ineffable knowledge is good in itself, not merely instrumentally good as a disposition that, other things being equal, enables the knower to satisfy her desires. I say not }{\i\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 merely}{

\par If this account of ineffable knowledge is correct, then Adorno is not committed to the view that having an ineffable insight is merely instrumentally valuable even on his very broad understand
ing of instrumental. The relation of self-conscious receptivity in which one stands to what is shown is by definition not a conceptual relation. An ineffable insight is good, but it is not a }{\i\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 conception}{

One cannot counter this objection just by pointing out that Adorno does exempt certain kinds of practice -  namely a certain narrowly circumscribed artistic modernism -  from his general suspicion. It is nonetheless 
true that Adorno believes that certain works of modern art succeed in embodying in a sensible form a truth content that cannot be grasped conceptually. Works of art can, he believes, be a source of experience that can lead to ineffable insight. However, h
e also claims that art works require philosophical interpretation if they are to yield these insights, their truth-content (AT 126-9). To be open to aesthetic experience is not to be }{\i\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 non-theoretically}{

\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903  that even though Enlightenment is a form of domination in the interest of self-preservation, it is not only that, for \lquote social freedom is inseparable from Enlightenment thinking\rquote

sistance is different in kind to Kantian ethics, which in Adorno\rquote s eyes makes the mistake of trying to stand morality on the sure footing of pure reason. To be }{\i\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 m\'fcndig,}{

I have attempted to make a case for the view that the intrinsically valuable experience of having an ineffable insight can serve as the normative basis of Adorno\rquote 
s ethics of resistance. This is I think the only viable solution to the problem of the availability of the good that is open to Adorno. Adorno is not, on this interpretation, guilty of lapsing into mysticism or irrationalism, he is just developing t
he practical implications of a coherent and philosophically legitimate concern with the ineffable. Nor is he open to the objection that his ethics of resistance is self-undermining, because acts of }{\i\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 M\'fc

y valuable, and thus are part of the context of universal fungibility they are supposed to resist. Finally, Adorno is not, on this view, being inconsistent by endorsing a normative ethics. Adorno can consistently endorse an ethics of resistance on the one
 hand and maintain, on the other, that we have no positive }{\i\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903 conception}{\f40\fs20\insrsid13633421\charrsid10958903
