In addition, CareMax recently opened two additional medical care centers in Memphis, Tennessee and one additional medical care center in New York City, New York for a total of 48 centers.}}\par
\pard \fi426 \li432\ri433\sb216 {\fs18 CareMax\u8217?s medical centers offer 24/7 access to care through employed providers and provide a comprehensive suite of high-touch health care and social services to its patients, including primary care, specialty care, telemedicine, health\u160?& wellness, optometry, dental, pharmacy and transportation. CareMax\u8217?s differentiated healthcare delivery model is focused on care coordination with vertically integrated ambulatory care and community-centric services. The goal of CareMax is to intercede as early as possible to manage chronic conditions for its patient members in a proactive, holistic, and tailored manner to provide a positive influence on patient outcomes and a reduction in overall healthcare costs. CareMax specifically focuses on providing access to high quality care in underserved communities, with approximately 60% of its Medicare Advantage patients being dual-eligible and{low-income}subsidy eligible as of December\u160?31, 2021.}\par
\pard \fi426 \li432\ri433\sb216 {\fs18 {While CareMax\u8217?s primary focus is providing care to Medicare-eligible seniors who are mostly over the age\u160?of 65, CareMax also provides services to children and adults through Medicaid programs as well as through commercial insurance plans. Nearly all of CareMax\u8217?s Medicare patients are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan run by private insurance companies on behalf of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u8220?CMS\u8221?). With Medicare Advantage, the patient receives the same coverage as original Medicare, including emergency care, and most plans also include prescription drug coverage. In many cases, Medicare Advantage plans offer even more than original Medicare, including dental, vision, hearing, and wellness programs.}}\par
\pard \fi426 \li432\ri433\sb216 {\fs18 CareMax\u8217?s comprehensive, high touch approach to health care delivery is powered by its CareOptimize technology platform. CareOptimize is a proprietary{{end-to-end}}technology platform that aggregates data and analyzes that data using artificial intelligence and machine learning to support more informed care delivery decisions and to focus care decisions on preventative chronic disease management and the social determinants of health. CareMax believes that CareOptimize is designed to drive better outcomes and lower costs. The CareOptimize technology platform also provides CareMax with a national reach beyond Florida. As of December\u160?31, 2021, the CareOptimize platform was used by approximately 20,000 providers in more than 30\u160?states. CareOptimize was also used by IMC prior to the Business Combination, which CareMax believes will support the integration and operation of the combined company. CareMax has shifted from selling the CareOptimize platform to outside customers for a software subscription fee and is instead providing the software to affiliated practices of its managed service organization (\u8220?MSO\u8221?) to further improve financial, clinical, and quality outcomes from the affiliated providers. As of December of 2021, this MSO services more than 30\u160?independent physician associations (\u8220?IPAs\u8221?).}\par

\pard \fi426 \li432\ri433\sb216 {\fs18 Further, Section\u160?102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a registration statement under the Securities Act declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to{non-emerging}growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard.

\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 In addition, the{COVID-19}virus disproportionately impacts older adults, especially those with chronic illnesses, which describes many of our patients. Patients have been and may continue to be reluctant to seek necessary care given the risks of the{COVID-19}pandemic. This could have the effect of deferring healthcare costs to later periods and may also affect the health of patients who defer treatment, which may cause our costs to increase in the future. We have and may continue to experience increased internal and third-party medical costs as we provide care for patients suffering from{COVID-19.}A material increase in costs has and may continue to adversely affect our financial results given the number of our patients who are under capitation agreements.}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 Due to the{COVID-19}pandemic, during 2020 we were not able to document the health conditions of our patients as completely as we have in the past. Medicare pays capitation using a \u8220?risk adjustment model,\u8221? which compensates MA health plans based on the health status (acuity) of each individual patient. Payors and their contracted providers with higher acuity patients receive more, and those with lower acuity patients receive less. Medicare requires that a patient\u8217?s health issues be documented annually regardless of the permanence of the underlying causes. Historically, this documentation was required to be completed during an{in-person}visit with a patient. As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act the \u8220?CARES Act\u8221?), which was signed into law on March\u160?27, 2020 and was designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the{COVID-19}pandemic, Medicare allowed documentation for conditions identified during video visits with patients. While we utilized telehealth to document the health conditions of our patients and increased our efforts to return our patients to our centers for{in-person}visits during the latter half of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, based on the difference between the risk adjusted PPPM revenue expected by our historical models and the actual risk adjusted PPPM rates in 2021, we believe our 2021 revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $11.5\u160?million due to our inability to adequately document the acuity of our patients during 2020. In the event we are unable to adequately document the acuity of our patients in subsequent years, our revenues and financial performance could be significantly affected.}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 During 2021, we also experienced increased costs directly related to{COVID-19}claims of approximately $11.6\u160?million.{COVID-19}related spikes in hospital utilization could continue to occur for the foreseeable future during the duration of the pandemic, which could negatively impact our revenues and financial performance during any period in which such hospital utilization spikes occur.}\par

\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb108 {\fs18 The reimbursement process is complex and can involve lengthy delays. Although we recognize revenue when we provide services to our patients, we may from time to time experience delays in receiving the associated capitation payments or, for our patients on{{fee-for-service}}arrangements, the reimbursement for the service provided. In addition, third-party payors may disallow, in whole or in part requests for reimbursement based on determinations that the patient is not eligible for coverage, certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage or were for services provided that were not medically necessary or additional supporting documentation is necessary. Retroactive adjustments may change amounts realized from third-party payors. As described below, we are subject to audits by such payors, including governmental audits of our Medicare claims, and may be required to repay these payors if a finding is made that we were incorrectly reimbursed. Delays and uncertainties in the reimbursement process may adversely affect accounts receivable, increase the overall costs of collection and cause us to incur additional borrowing costs. Third-party payors are also increasingly focused on controlling healthcare costs, and such efforts, including any revisions to reimbursement policies, may further complicate and delay our reimbursement claims.}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 {In addition, certain of our patients are covered under health plans that require the patient to cover a portion of their own healthcare expenses through the payment of copayments or deductibles. There also may be instances where physicians provide services to uninsured individuals. To the extent permitted by law, amounts not covered by third-party payors are the obligations of individual patients. Despite reasonable efforts, we may not be able to collect all, or any, of those amounts that are the patient\u8217?s financial responsibility. Any increase in cost shifting from third-party payors to individual patients, including as a result of high deductible plans for patients, increases our collection costs and reduces overall collections. We have a financial assistance policy in which we assess patients for financial hardship and other criteria that are used to make a good-faith determination of financial need. If a patient is deemed to meet these criteria, we will waive or reduce that patient\u8217?s obligation to pay copayments, coinsurance or deductible amounts owed for the services we provide to them. If we were to experience a substantial increase in the number of patients qualifying for such waivers or reductions or in the volume of patient receivables deemed uncollectible, our costs could increase significantly and we may not be able to offset such additional costs with sufficient revenue.}}\par

\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb108 {\fs18 We are an \u8220?emerging growth company\u8221? within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section\u160?404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five\u160?years after our IPO, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by{non-affiliates}exceeds $700\u160?million as of any June\u160?30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December\u160?31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 Further, Section\u160?102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to{non-emerging}growth companies but any election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of the extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.}\par

As such, when our stock price increases, the fair value of the Warrant liability would increase, and we would be required to recognize an expense associated with this change in fair value. Similarly, when our stock price decreases, the fair value of the Warrant liability would decrease, and we would be required to recognize a gain associated with this change in fair value.

CareMax\u8217?s differentiated healthcare delivery model is focused on care coordination with vertically integrated ambulatory care and community-centric services. The goal of CareMax is to intercede as early as possible to manage chronic conditions for its patient members in a proactive, holistic, and tailored manner to provide a positive influence on patient outcomes and a reduction in overall healthcare costs. CareMax specifically focuses on providing access to high quality care in underserved communities, with approximately 60% of its Medicare Advantage patients being dual-eligible (meaning eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid) and{low-income}subsidy eligible as of December\u160?31, 2021.}\par

\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 CareMax\u8217?s comprehensive, high touch approach to health care delivery is powered by its CareOptimize technology platform.

CareMax believes that CareOptimize is designed to drive better outcomes and lower costs. The CareOptimize technology platform also provides CareMax with a national reach beyond Florida. As of December\u160?31, 2021, the CareOptimize platform was used by approximately 20,000 providers in more than 30\u160?states. CareOptimize was also used by IMC prior to the Business Combination, which has supported the integration and operation of the combined company. CareMax has shifted from selling the CareOptimize platform to new outside customers for a software subscription fee and is instead focused on providing the software to affiliated practices of its managed service organization (\u8220?MSO\u8221?) to further improve financial, clinical, and quality outcomes from the affiliated providers.

According to data published by CMS and the Kaiser Family Foundation (\u8220?KFF\u8221?), Miami-Dade, Broward, Orange, Osceola, Lake, Seminole and Hillsborough counties have a population of 1.5\u160?million Medicare eligibles, and 1.0\u160?million in Medicare Advantage enrollment, equating to a 63% market penetration for Medicare Advantage as of December 2021. CareMax has approximately 33,500 Medicare Advantage members in its existing centers, which leaves sufficient capacity to double membership in its current centers. Growth in existing centers has historically led to increased financial performance at a center level by positively affecting center margins. For example, CareMax\u8217?s centers that opened prior to 2017 have shown an increase in Platform Contribution Margin, which is revenue less external provider costs and cost of care (excluding depreciation and amortization), divided by risk-based revenues, from breakeven at approximately 50% capacity to a 20% Platform Contribution Margin at 70% capacity. With an average capacity of 1,650 patients, our 45 centers as of December\u160?31, 2021 can support approximately 75,000 Medicare-Equivalent Member (\u8220?MCREM\u8221?) patients. As we add patients to our existing centers, we expect these patients to contribute incremental economics to CareMax as we leverage our fixed cost base at each center. The additional de novo centers we expect to open in 2022 will also increase our capacity. We believe that we currently serve approximately 2% of the total patients in the markets where we currently have centers. As a result, there is significant opportunity to expand in our existing markets through the acquisition of new patients.}\par

CareMax has entered into a collaboration agreement with Anthem, Inc., a national health benefits company (\u8220?Anthem\u8221?), through which CareMax plans to open approximately 50 centers across eight priority states. Additionally, CareMax has entered into a collaboration with Related{\ul ,}pursuant to which Related will advise CareMax on opening new medical centers nationwide, including but not limited to within and proximate to affordable housing communities that may be owned by Related.}\par

Our existing market today represent a small fraction of this massive market opportunity. Based upon our experience to date, we believe our innovative care model can scale nationally, and we therefore expect to selectively and strategically expand into new geographies. As we continue this expansion, our success will depend on the competitive dynamics in those markets, and our ability to attract patients and deploy our care model in those markets. Through CareOptimize\u8217?s clients, which are spread across more than 30 states, we already understand the healthcare dynamics in communities where we are looking to expand.

\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb108 {\fs18 Policymakers and healthcare experts generally acknowledge the fundamental challenges and opportunities for improvement in the delivery of healthcare in the United States. Historically, healthcare delivery was centered around reactive care to acute events, which resulted in the development of a{{fee-for-service}}payment model. By linking payments to volume of encounters and pricing for higher complexity interventions, the{{fee-for-service}}model does not reward prevention, but rather unintentionally incentivizes the treatment of acute care episodes as they occur.}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 Policymakers have taken note of the negative impacts created by the{{fee-for-service}}model and have realized that an aging United States population with high prevalence of chronic disease requires a new payment structure. They have responded by creating programs like Medicare Advantage and pushing for transitions to value-based reimbursements.}\par
\pard \li250\ri250\sb324 {\fs18 {\b {{\i Medicare Advantage}}}}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb108 {\fs18 Medicare Advantage works as an alternative to traditional{{fee-for-service}}Medicare. In Medicare Advantage, CMS pays health plans a monthly sum per member to manage all health expenses of a participating member. This provides the health plans with an incentive to deliver lower-cost, high-quality care.}\par
\pard \li250\ri250\sb324 {\fs18 {\b {{\i Value-based payments}}}}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb108 {\fs18 Value-based refers to the goal of incentivizing healthcare providers to simultaneously increase quality while lowering the cost of care. In January 2015, HHS announced a goal of tying 30% and 50% of all Medicare payments to value through alternative payment models by the end of 2016 and 2018, respectively. In addition, while not a policy-setting body, the Health Care Payment Learning\u160?& Action Network, an active group of public and private healthcare leaders, indicated in October of 2019 its desire to move 100% of Medicare payments to being tied to value- based care by 2025. Additionally, CMS began using a Direct Contracting Model in 2021 for value-based payment arrangements directly with 53 provider groups for their current Medicare{{fee-for-service}}patients similar to the value-based contracts that we enter into with our Medicare Advantage partners. Effective January 2023, ACO REACH program is replacing the Direct Contracting Model.}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 {The trend toward value-based payment systems has been supported at both the patient and policymaker level. Medicare Advantage has been well received since it was introduced, with penetration among Medicare beneficiaries increasing from 13% in 2004 to 42% in 2021, according to KFF. By 2030, the Congressional Budget Office projects that Medicare Advantage penetration will increase to approximately 51%.}}\par

While there has been significant investment by providers, payors and technology companies in developing solutions to drive higher quality and lower cost of care, these investments have not resulted in meaningful change within a healthcare delivery infrastructure that remains optimized for the{{fee-for-service}}model.}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 In order to maintain economically viable practices in a{{fee-for-service}}payment model, typical primary care providers need to see an ever-increasing number of patients per day with limited support from staff, which limits the time providers are able to spend with each patient during office visits. In addition, financial constraints further limit the ability of primary care providers to invest in technology and other capabilities that would enable them to have more personalized patient engagement and prevent primary care providers from providing their patients with many of the supplemental services that they need, such as home-based primary care, medication management and behavioral health services that are often not reimbursed at a sufficient level to enable providers to offer these services.}\par

Additional security requirements apply to electronic PHI. These regulations also provide patients with substantive rights with respect to their health information. As a HIPAA covered entity, CareMax is required to enter into written agreements with certain contractors, known as business associates, to whom CareMax discloses PHI. Covered entities may be subject to penalties for, among other activities, failing to enter into a business associate agreement where required by law or as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity and acting within the scope of the agency. In instances where CareMax acts as a business associate to a covered entity, there is the potential for additional liability beyond CareMax\u8217?s status as a covered entity.}}\par

Reporting must also be made to the HHS Office for Civil Rights and, for breaches of unsecured PHI involving more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, to the media. All impermissible uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the PHI has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require CareMax to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving personal information without regard to the probability of the information being compromised.}}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 Violations of HIPAA by providers like CareMax, including, but not limited to, failing to implement appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, have resulted in enforcement actions and in some cases triggered settlement payments or civil monetary penalties. Penalties for impermissible use or disclosure of PHI were increased by the HITECH Act by imposing tiered penalties of more than $50,000 per violation and up to $1.5\u160?million per year for identical violations. In addition, HIPAA provides for criminal penalties of up to $250,000 and ten years in prison, with the severest penalties for obtaining and disclosing PHI with the intent to sell, transfer or use such information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Further, state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. CareMax follows and maintains a HIPAA compliance plan, which CareMax believes complies with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations, but there can be no assurance that OCR or other regulators will agree. There can be no assurance that CareMax will not be the subject of an investigation (arising out of a reportable breach incident, audit or otherwise) alleging{non-compliance}with HIPAA regulations in CareMax\u8217?s maintenance of PHI.

CareMax offers a comprehensive range of medical services, including primary and preventative care, specialist services, diagnostic testing, chronic disease management and dental and optometry services under global capitation contracts.}}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 CareMax\u8217?s comprehensive, high touch approach to health care delivery is powered by its CareOptimize technology platform. CareOptimize is a proprietary{{end-to-end}}technology platform that aggregates data and analyzes that data using proprietary algorithms and machine learning to support more informed care delivery decisions and to focus care decisions on preventative chronic disease management and the social determinants of health. CareMax believes that CareOptimize is designed to drive better outcomes and lower costs. The CareOptimize technology platform also provides CareMax with a national reach beyond Florida. As of December\u160?31, 2021, the CareOptimize platform was used by approximately 20,000 providers in more than 30\u160?states. CareMax has shifted from selling the CareOptimize platform to new outside customers for a software subscription fee and is instead focused on providing the software to affiliated practices of its managed services organization (\u8220?MSO\u8221?) to further improve financial, clinical and quality outcomes from the affiliated providers. As of December of 2021, this MSO services more than 100 independent physician associations (\u8220?IPAs\u8221?).}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 CarMax\u8217?s medical centers offer 24/7 access to care through employed providers and provide a comprehensive suite of high-touch health care and social services to its patients, including primary care, specialty care, telemedicine, health\u160?& wellness, optometry, dental, pharmacy and transportation. CareMax\u8217?s differentiated healthcare delivery model is focused on care coordination with vertically integrated ambulatory care and community-centric services. The goal of CareMax is to intercede as early as possible to manage chronic conditions for its patient members in a proactive, holistic, and tailored manner to provide a positive influence on patient outcomes and a reduction in overall healthcare costs. CareMax specifically focuses on providing access to high quality care in underserved communities, with approximately 60% of its Medicare Advantage patients being dual-eligible (meaning eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid) and{low-income}subsidy eligible as of December\u160?31, 2021.}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 {While CareMax\u8217?s primary focus is providing care to Medicare eligible seniors who are mostly 65+ (79% of revenue for the twelve months ended December\u160?31, 2021, came from these patients), we also provide services to children and adults through Medicaid programs as well as through commercial insurance plans. Substantially all of CareMax\u8217?s Medicare patients are enrolled in MA plans which are run by private insurance companies, and are approved by and under contract with Medicare. With MA, patients get all of the same coverage as original Medicare, including emergency care, and most plans also include prescription drug coverage. In many cases, MA plans offer more benefits than original Medicare, including dental, vision, hearing and wellness programs.}}\par

\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb108 {\fs18 On June\u160?8, 2021, we consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated December\u160?18, 2020 (the \u8220?Business Combination Agreement\u8221?), by and among Deerfield Healthcare Technology Acquisitions Corp., a Delaware corporation now known as CareMax, Inc. (\u8220?DFHT\u8221?). CareMax Medical Group, L.L.C., a Florida limited liability company (\u8220?CMG\u8221?), the entities listed in Annex I to the Business Combination Agreement (the \u8220?CMG Sellers\u8221?), IMC, IMC Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (\u8220?IMC Parent\u8221?), and Deerfield Partners, L.P pursuant to which, on June\u160?8, 2021 (the \u8220?Closing Date\u8221?), DFHT acquired 100% of the equity interests in CMG and 100% of the equity interests in IMC, with CMG and IMC becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of DFHT. Immediately upon completion (the \u8220?Closing\u8221?) of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and the related financing transactions (the \u8220?Business Combination\u8221?), the name of the combined company was changed to CareMax, Inc. CMG was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination. Accordingly, the acquisition of CMG by the Company was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Under this method of accounting, CMG was treated as the acquiree for financial reporting purposes. The net assets of CMG were stated at their historical cost, with no goodwill or other separately identifiable intangible assets recorded. The balance sheet, results of operations and cash flows prior to the Business Combination are those of CMG. Further, CMG was determined to be the accounting acquirer of IMC and the acquisition of IMC (the \u8220?IMC Acquisition\u8221?) was accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805,{{\i Business Combinations}}(\u8220?ASC 805\u8221?) as a business combination. Accordingly, the IMC assets acquired, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair value as of the Closing Date. The IMC Acquisition drove, among other things, increases of $6.2\u160?million in Property and Equipment, $34.1\u160?million in amortizable intangible assets and $302.2\u160?million in goodwill as of December\u160?31, 2021, as compared to our balance sheet as of December\u160?31, 2020.

This is due to Medicare patients on average having significantly higher levels of chronic and acute conditions that need higher levels of care.

Certain illnesses, such as the influenza virus, are far more prevalent during colder months of the year, which can result in an increase in medical expenses during these time periods. We would therefore expect to see higher levels of{per-patient}medical costs in the first and fourth quarters. Medical costs also depend upon the number of business days in a period. Shorter periods will have lesser medical costs due to fewer business days. Business days can also create year-over-year comparability issues if one year has a different number of business days compared to another. We would also expect to experience an impact in the future should there be another pandemic such as{COVID-19,}which may result in increased or decreased total medical costs depending upon the severity of the infection, the duration of the infection and the impact to the supply and availability of healthcare services for our patients.}\par

\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb108 {\fs18 {We expect to continue to focus on long-term growth through investments in our centers, platform, care model and marketing. In addition, we expect our corporate, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future to support our growth and because of additional costs as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, Sarbanes Oxley Act compliance, the stock exchange listing standards, additional corporate and director and officer insurance expenses, greater investor relations expenses and increased legal, audit and consulting fees. As we have communicated, we plan to invest in openings of new de novo centers both within and outside of Florida over the next several years. Historically, de novo centers require upfront capital and operating expenditures, which may not be fully offset by additional revenues in the near-term, and we similarly expect a period of unprofitability in our future de novo centers before they break even. While our net income may decrease in the future because of these activities, we plan to balance these investments in future growth with a continued focus on managing our results of operations and generating positive income from our core centers and scaled acquisitions. In the longer term we anticipate that these investments will positively impact our business and results of operations.}}\par

\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb108 {\fs18 Certain financial information and data contained this prospectus is unaudited and does not conform to Regulation{S-X.}Accordingly, such information and data may not be included in, may be adjusted in, or may be presented differently in, any periodic filing, information or proxy statement, or prospectus or registration statement to be filed by the Company with the SEC. Some of the financial information and data contained in this prospectus, such as Adjusted EBITDA and margin thereof, Platform Contribution and margin thereof and Pro Forma Medical Expense Ratio have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These{non-GAAP}measures of financial results are not GAAP measures of our financial results or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of financial results, cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes these{non-GAAP}measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company\u8217?s financial condition and results of operations. Management uses these{non-GAAP}measures for trend analyses and for budgeting and planning purposes.}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 The Company believes that the use of these{non-GAAP}financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating projected operating results and trends in and in comparing the Company\u8217?s financial measures with other similar companies, many of which present similar{non-GAAP}financial measures to investors. Management does not consider these{non-GAAP}measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these{non-GAAP}financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company\u8217?s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining these{non-GAAP}financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents{non-GAAP}financial measures in connection with GAAP results. You should review the Company\u8217?s audited financial statements, which included in this prospectus.}\par
\pard \li250\ri250\sb324 {\fs18 {\b {EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA}}}\par
\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb108 {\fs18 Management defines \u8220?EBITDA\u8221? as net income or net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, and gain or loss on extinguishment of debt. \u8220?Adjusted EBITDA\u8221? is defined as EBITDA adjusted for special items such as duplicative costs,{non-recurring}legal, consulting, and professional fees, stock based compensation, de novo costs for the first 18 months after opening, discontinued operations, acquisition costs and other costs that are considered{one-time}in nature as determined by management. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA presented on a pro forma basis gives effect to the acquisitions of IMC and Care Holdings Group, LLC, which owned Care Optimize, as if they had occurred in historical periods, which does not necessarily reflect what the Company\u8217?s Adjusted EBITDA would have been had the acquisitions occurred on the dates indicated. Adjusted EBITDA is intended to be used as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Management believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial measure with those of comparable companies, which may present similar{non-GAAP}financial measures to investors. However, we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentations of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or{non-recurring}items. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.}\par

\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb108 {\fs18 {{\i Medicare Risk-Based Revenue and Medicaid Risk-Based Revenue.}}Our capitated revenue consists primarily of fees for medical services provided by us or managed by our MSO under a global capitation arrangement made directly with various MA payors. Capitation is a fixed amount of money per patient per month paid in advance for the delivery of health care services, whereby we are generally liable for medical costs in excess of the fixed payment and are able to retain any surplus created if medical costs are less than the fixed payment. A portion of our capitated revenues are typically prepaid monthly to us based on the number of MA patients selecting us as their primary care provider. Our capitated rates are determined as a percentage of the premium the MA plan receives from CMS for our{at-risk}members. Those premiums are determined via a competitive bidding process with CMS and are based upon the cost of care in a local market and the average utilization of services by the patients enrolled. Medicare pays capitation using a \u8220?risk adjustment model,\u8221? which compensates providers based on the health status (acuity) of each individual patient. Payors with higher acuity patients receive more in premium, and those with lower acuity patients receive less in premium. Under the risk adjustment model, capitation is paid on an interim basis based on enrollee data submitted for the preceding year and is adjusted in subsequent periods after the final data is compiled. As premiums are adjusted via this risk adjustment model, our capitation payments will change in unison with how our payor partners\u8217? premiums change with CMS. Risk adjustment in future periods may be impacted by{COVID-19}and our inability to accurately document the health needs of our patients in a compliant manner, which may have an adverse impact on our revenue.}\par

AHCA uses a \u8220?zero sum\u8221? risk adjustment model that establishes acuity for certain cohorts of patients quarterly, depending on the scoring of that acuity, and may periodically shift premiums from health plans with lower acuity members to health plans with higher acuity members.}}\par

Incentive payments for Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (\u8220?HEDIS\u8221?) and any services paid on a{{fee-for-service}}basis by a health plan are also included in other revenue. Other revenue also includes ancillary fees earned under contracts with certain payors for the provision of certain care coordination and other care management services.

\pard \fi440 \li250\ri250\sb108 {\fs18 {As of December\u160?31, 2021, we had cash on hand of $47.9\u160?million. Our principal sources of liquidity have been our operating cash flows, borrowings under our Credit Facilities and proceeds from equity issuances. We have used these funds to meet our capital requirements, which consist of salaries, labor, benefits and other employee-related costs, product and supply costs, third-party customer service, billing and collections and logistics costs, capital expenditures including patient equipment, medical center and office lease expenses, insurance premiums, acquisitions and debt service. Our future capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and scale of our expansion in new and existing markets, patient volume, and revenue growth rates. Many of our capital expenditures are made in advance of patients beginning service. Certain operating costs are incurred at the beginning of the equipment service period and during initial patient set up. We also expect to incur costs related to acquisitions and de novo growth through the opening of new medical centers, which we expect to require significant capital expenditures, including lease and construction expenses. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing, in addition to cash on hand and borrowings under our Credit Facilities in connection with our business growth, including debt financing that may be available to us from certain health plans for each new medical center that we open under the terms of our agreements with those health plans. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on acceptable terms or at all. If additional capital is unavailable when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. We do not expect to rely materially on the cash exercise of Warrants to fund our operations. We do not believe it is likely that a warrant holder would elect to exercise their Warrants when our Class\u160?A Common Stock is trading below $11.50 and any cash proceeds that would be received by the Company is dependent on the trading price of the Class\u160?A Common Stock underlying the Warrants. We believe that our expected operating cash flows, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents, amounts available under our Credit Facilities, and amounts available to us under our agreement with Anthem, each as described below will continue to be sufficient to fund our operations and growth strategies for at least the next 12 months and remain in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Facilities and other agreements.}}\par

This is due to Medicare patients on average having significantly higher levels of chronic and acute conditions that need higher levels of care.

As we have communicated, we plan to invest in openings of new de novo centers over the next several years.

We believe this metric best reflects the economics of our care model as it includes all medical claims expense associated with our patients\u8217? care as well as the costs we incur to care for our patients via the CareMax System. As a center matures, we expect the platform contribution from that center to increase both in terms of absolute dollars as well as a percentage of capitated revenue. This increase will be driven by improving patient contribution economics over time, as well as our ability to generate operating leverage on the costs of our centers. Our aggregate platform contribution may not increase despite improving economics at our existing centers should we open new centers at a pace that skews our mix of centers towards newer centers. We would expect to experience minimal seasonality in platform contribution due to minimal seasonality in our patient contribution.}\par

A portion of our capitated revenues are typically prepaid monthly to us based on the number of MA patients selecting us as their primary care provider. Our capitated rates are determined as a percentage of the premium the MA plan receives from CMS for{our\u160?at-risk\u160?members.}Those premiums are determined via a competitive bidding process with CMS and are based upon the cost of care in a local market and the average utilization of services by the patients enrolled. Medicare pays capitation using a \u8220?risk adjustment model,\u8221? which compensates providers based on the health status (acuity) of each individual patient. Payors with higher acuity patients receive more in premium, and those with lower acuity patients receive less in premium. Under the risk adjustment model, capitation is paid on an interim basis based on enrollee data submitted for the preceding year and is adjusted in subsequent periods after the final data is compiled. As premiums are adjusted via this risk adjustment model, our capitation payments will change in unison with how our payor partners\u8217? premiums change with CMS. Risk adjustment in future periods may be impacted by{COVID-19}and our inability to accurately document the health needs of our patients in a compliant manner, which may have an adverse impact on our revenue.}\par

The rates are established based on specific cohorts by age and sex and geographical location. AHCA uses a \u8220?zero sum\u8221? risk adjustment model that establishes acuity for certain cohorts of patients quarterly, depending on the scoring of that acuity, and may periodically shift premiums from health plans with lower acuity members to health plans with higher acuity members.}}\par

These revenues are a fixed amount of money per patient per month paid in advance for the delivery of primary care services only, whereby CareMax is not liable for medical costs in excess of the fixed payment. Capitated revenues are typically prepaid monthly to CareMax based on the number of patients selecting us as their primary care provider. Our capitated rates are fixed, contractual rates. Incentive payments for Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (\u8220?HEDIS\u8221?) and any services paid on a fee for service basis by a health plan are also included in other revenue. Other revenue also includes ancillary fees earned under contracts with certain payors for the provision of certain care coordination and other care management services. These services are provided to patients covered by these payors regardless of whether those patients receive their care from our affiliated medical groups. Revenue for primary care service for patients in a partial risk or{up-side}only contracts, pharmacy revenue and revenue generated from CareOptimize are reported in other revenue.}\par

Finally, as reflected in the table above, if the Warrants are out of the money and about to expire, they cannot be exercised on a cashless basis in connection with a redemption by us pursuant to this redemption feature, since they will not be exercisable for any shares of Class\u160?A Common Stock.}}\par

This redemption feature is structured to allow for all of the outstanding warrants to be redeemed when the Class\u160?A Common Stock is trading at or above $10.00 per public share, which may be at a time when the trading price of the Class\u160?A Common Stock is below the exercise price of the Warrants. We have established this redemption feature to provide us with the flexibility to redeem the Warrants without the Warrants having to reach the $18.00 per share threshold set forth above under \u8220?Redemption of Warrants when the price per share of Class\u160?A Common Stock equals or exceeds $18.00.\u8221? Holders choosing to exercise their Warrants in connection with a redemption pursuant to this feature will, in effect, receive a number of shares for their Warrants based on an option pricing model with a fixed volatility input. This redemption right provides us with an additional mechanism by which to redeem all of the outstanding Warrants, and therefore have certainty as to the capital structure as the Warrants would no longer be outstanding and would have been exercised or redeemed. We will be required to pay the applicable redemption price to Warrant holders if we choose to exercise this redemption right, which will allow us to quickly proceed with a redemption of the Warrants if we determine it is in our best interest to do so. As such, we would redeem the Warrants in this manner when we believe it is in our best interest to update our capital structure to remove the Warrants and pay the redemption price to the Warrant holders.}}\par

If we choose to redeem the Warrants when the Class\u160?A Common Stock is trading at a price below the exercise price of the Warrants, this could result in the Warrant holders receiving fewer shares of Class\u160?A Common Stock than they would have received if they had chosen to wait to exercise their Warrants for shares of Class\u160?A Common Stock if and when such shares of Class\u160?A Common Stock were trading at a price higher than the exercise price of $11.50.}}\par

This summary does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to particular investors in light of their individual circumstances, including investors subject to special tax rules (e.g., financial institutions, insurance companies, broker-dealers, dealers or traders in securities,{tax-exempt}organizations (including private foundations), taxpayers that have elected{{mark-to-market}}accounting, S corporations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, passive foreign investment companies, controlled foreign corporations, U.S. Holders (as defined below) that will hold Class\u160?A Common Stock or Warrants as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States, or investors that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar), all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ materially from those summarized below. This summary does not discuss other U.S. federal tax consequences (e.g., estate or gift tax), any state, local, or{non-U.S.}tax considerations or the Medicare tax or alternative minimum tax. In addition, this summary is limited to investors that will hold our securities as \u8220?capital assets\u8221?

An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Accordingly, the entity through which our securities are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required. Similarly, dividends in respect of our securities held by an investor that is a{non-financial}{non-U.S.}entity that does not qualify under certain exceptions will generally be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 30%, unless such entity either (1)\u160?certifies to us or the applicable withholding agent that such entity does not have any \u8220?substantial United States owners\u8221? or (2)\u160?provides certain information regarding the entity\u8217?s \u8220?substantial United States owners,\u8221? which will in turn be provided to the U.S. Department of Treasury. Withholding under FATCA was scheduled to apply to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of property that produces U.S.-source interest or dividends, however, the IRS released proposed regulations that, if finalized in their proposed form, would eliminate the obligation to withhold on such gross proceeds. Although these proposed Treasury Regulations are not final, taxpayers generally may rely on them until final Treasury Regulations are issued. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on their investment in our securities.}\par

\pard \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 We have indefinitely-lived intangible assets consisting of goodwill. Pursuant to FASB ASC{350-10,}these indefinitely-lived intangible assets are not amortized for financial reporting purposes. However, these assets are tax deductible, and therefore amortized over 15{{\u160?}years for tax purposes. As such, deferred income tax expense and a deferred tax liability arise as a result of the{tax-deductibility}of these indefinitely-lived intangible assets. The resulting deferred tax liability, which is expected to continue to increase over time, will have an indefinite life, resulting in what is referred to as a \u8220?naked credit.\u8221? This deferred tax liability could remain on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment of the related assets (for financial reporting purposes), or the business to which those assets relate were to be disposed of. Due to the fact that the aforementioned deferred tax liability could have an indefinite life, it can only be netted against the portion of our other indefinitely lived deferred tax assets (which primarily relate to post-2018 net operating loss and business interest expense carryforwards) when determining the required valuation allowance. Doing so would result in the understatement of the valuation allowance and related deferred income tax expense. As a result, a full valuation has been recorded against the Company\u8217?s net deferred tax assets, except for this excess deferred tax liability (\u8220?naked credit\u8221?).}}\par
