Founded in 1997, Project Neighborhood provides intentional Christian community to college students of Calvin, along with live-in post-college adult mentors.  There are currently 6 houses that are part of Project Neighborhood--some of which are connected to local churched and all are connected with service-learning partnerships.

Neighbors following Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/springwater/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/springwater/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
//COMMMUNITY DESCRIPTION//
Springwater is a lay-led and covenanted neighborhood-rooted church of Anabaptist conviction.  We're in ten houses (19 members and novices, 12 kids, many chickens, 3 dogs) within a 5-minute walk

We gather around practices which express shared values such as simplicity, nonviolence, mutual discernment, and justice-seeking.  Our pocket of Portland's eclectic Lents neighborhood is the arena for us to experiment with working all that out.

We gather weekly with a meal to celebrate what Jesus has been up to in the neighborhood.  We also gather mid-week either for a neighborhood initiative/project/activity/event, a family business meeting, or small discipling groups.  Households and clusters of households meet up throughout the week over meals according to their own schedule and hopes.

Oh, and a lot of us bicycle and vegetable garden.  :)

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21668&quot;&gt;Pleasant Valley Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To support one another in awakening to Reality and to the full potential of each individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/pleasant-valley-sanctuary/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/pleasant-valley-sanctuary/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are a small collective of yoga practitioners and devotees who have a desire to share the teachings of yoga and spirituality in an informal setting. With a small core of permanent residents, and a revolving cast of interns and retreat attendees, we co-create a vibrant and diverse center for spiritual living. We are musical, fun-loving and devotional, having deep roots in Yogananda’s path of Kriya Yoga.
As the result of inner inspiration our outward lifestyle at the Sanctuary has been shaped by the values of permaculture, alternative energy, and intentional community. We embrace all of the gifts and challenges that come with living side by side with an array of differing energies, ages and perspectives while daily attuning ourselves to the One Reality behind all differences.
Although the teachings and lineage of Yogananda are emphasized we Love all true Masters and saints…..
Pleasant Valley Sanctuary is located on a secluded and truly charming stretch of the Sierra Nevada foothills in Northern California. We are a small, spiritual community living our highest ideals and sharing that process with others. Living off-grid since 2002 has allowed us to develop our own harmonious, workable homesteading model, that is centered around authentic experience of the Divine through meditation and yoga. We welcome those who want to experience the gifts of such a lifestyle for work exchanges or internships. We also have a busy schedule of structured retreats led by both residents and our extended spiritual community.
We believe, as the great yogi master Paramhansa Yogananda did, that small, spiritually committed communities with a cooperative spirit are both powerful tools for our own spiritual growth and the key ingredient to uplifting the planet.
Adjacent to state park land, the retreat acreage is a scenic blend of meadows, seasonal creeks with waterfalls and picturesque views of the rolling foothills that line the Yuba river canyon.
The retreat center serves as both the facility for visiting guests and as a sustainable homestead for the current long-term residents and co-founders.
Solar panels provide electricity, an artesian well flows with sweet water, and a large, booming garden/orchard yields much of the food year round.
The atmosphere is informal and homey, appealing to those who do not feel drawn to organized settings.

      <name>Ashram West</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21683&quot;&gt;Ashram West&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Enlightenment and Service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ashram-west/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ashram-west/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Ashram West was founded in 1997 and incorporated in California as a 501c3 non-profit organization in 2001 to inspire and guide gay-identified persons to enlightenment and to offer service to the community. There are both monks, i.e., dedicated member-practitioners, who may be residents or non-residents, and lay members. 

The teachings of Ashram West are based on Vedanta philosophy and traditional Hindu Tantra in the lineage of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda, that encourages the integration of all aspects of life with spirituality, including sexuality. Vedanta teaches that our fundamental nature is pure, perfect, and divine, and one specialty of Tantra is a whole body of spiritual technologies for developing greater awareness of the our true divine Self. We offer meditation instruction, spiritual coaching, and counseling for individuals, couples, or groups free of charge with donations gratefully accepted. All persons are welcome to enjoy the benefits of our community services and activities.

Although most ashram members are gay men, and residence is for men only, we also have non-gay women students who form part of our extended world-wide family, united by email and occasional personal visits. We invite men of any sexual-affectional orientation to apply for membership as monks. Celibacy is neither required nor preferred, but resident monks must conduct committed relationships, if any, in service of the community and its goals. Non-resident monks live according the Rule of the Order of Ashram West but are free to conduct relationships as they like. All resident monks contribute to the material support and physical maintenance of the community, and they may hold outside jobs as necessary to make this possible. 

Currently the ashram exists in a large one-bedroom apartment in Silver Lake with two permanent residents, including Brother William, the Founder and Spiritual Director. We are seeking a larger residence that will permit more monks and visitors to live in community and provide space for rituals, classes, and our kirtan group that meets weekly for joyous group singing and spiritual chats. If you already occupy or own a property suitable for us, or if you have the resources to help us purchase a property, we can consider accelerating the process of your becoming a monk.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21688&quot;&gt;Serenity House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Serenity House aspires to create a healing community that is based on compassion and service to humanity using Non-Violent Communication, ancient yogic teachings and local indigenous healing practises.
We strive to be as self sufficient as possible and live in harmony with the earth and our neighbors, we grow our own food and share our healing wisdom with our local community so that they may thrive as well and distribute moringa as a way to sustain the health of all peoples and our own economic well being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/in-la-kesh/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/in-la-kesh/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Serenity House is located 12 km outside of Alto Paraiso, Goias, Brazil, near the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park.
The town (population: 7,000) is in the world’s most biologically rich savannah ecosystem, with scenery that simultaneously conjures the vast plains of Africa and the rippling mountains of Kauai. Scattered about are hundreds of waterfalls, many flowing into river pools that are warm enough to swim in and clean enough to drink from. The region’s geology also comes with the requisite mystical component: Just beneath the soil is the world’s largest crystal bed, allegedly so luminous that it’s visible from outer space. 

We have come together to manifest from the heart, creating abundance and ease by living together in connection and harmony with the earth, building sustainable adobe or bamboo homes and practicing permaculture and biodynamic gardening.
We use natural ancient medicinal healing practises and eat pranic alive whole foods. We have an amazing abundance of GMO free and organic food in the area we live in.
We come from different cultures and backgrounds and are sharing and growing in the healing arts and using the wisdom of indigenous &amp;amp; yogic cultures-see more information on our website www.yogaofbeauty.net
We have a vision of acquiring the land we are currently residing on, with the intention of it being held in community trust that is set up legally to protect all share holders, yet the land will not be owned by any one person, acknowledging that the land belongs to us all as a gift.
We have enough space to accommodate 4 families comfortably as well as host volunteers and there is room to expand the community if we desire. The land can be purchased for a collective buy in fee of $12,000 per family (please contact us directly for further details) we have very rich soil for growing food and trees and building structures with adobe or bamboo. 
All the water we drink and use is coming from a live spring in the mountain, we live steps away from two rivers that intersect that have very clean water. The community we live in is very small, friendly and safe, the weather is sub-tropical and the climate is pleasant all year long.
By practicing Consensus and Non-Violent Communication we aspire to grow in the challenges that arise from coming together out of domination based societies and finding new ways to live in harmony with one another through this shared living experience.
One of our collective projects is growing moringa, and we consistently are moving towards self sufficiency, barter, and other forms of exchange besides paper.
We have a process of becoming a guest first, getting to know one another for a period of 4 months and then deciding if a longer stay or integration into community is of benefit for all through consensus, we know that all people have valuable gifts to offer and we welcome you to come and share in this beautiful vision.

&quot;When you look into the eyes of another person, you are looking into your own eyes&quot;

Golden Rule-Rainbow-Community
&amp;amp; Permaculture Demo-farm

On a small Island south-west of Bohol in the Philippines we are establishing a Community based on spiritual aspects.
At the same time we do self sustaining farming and follow permaculture principles on a lot of almost 1'700 sqm.
The lot has around 7 different sections containing:

1. Entrance, Rest House with basement, workshop, open- and deep-well
2. Forest Garden with composting area, compost toilet, outdoor shower, Bird cage, water storage and grow beds
3. Shaded Labyrinth garden and sweat lodge
4. Japanese Pond Garden
5. Rocky pits with Meditation Hall base for Geodesic Dome
6. (Earth-House/future project) Ditch with recognizable cliff side
7. Rocky Coral hill with different plant varieties

A small rest house of native style gives us shelter from moody weather. The climate is tropical, sometimes rainy but mostly warm.
A Solar-Island-System provides us with electricity and a deep well pump ensures us plenty of water with the small disadvantage of salinity. 
The farm is located on mostly flat alvar terain, approx 10m above sea level and about 1km away from the sea cliffs. 

Our rest house can accommodate people in 3 small rooms.
Currently there are 4 people, 1 cat, 4 dogs, 1 rabbit, fish and a few chickens living at the Rainbow Farm.
We are still open for new members and volunteers;
People with skills and sencitivity towards the surrounding as spiritual guides and practicioners are most welcome.

Coming here is for most people, which are not used to Asia a bit of a culture shock.
We are trying ourselves to find the balance between the local culture, other species of plants and the cultural background we come from. Sometimes it's necessary to look at things with less expectations to manage daily challenges in communication with locals.
Anyhow, we just like you to know that we take our spiritual path very serious, practice unselfish love in meditation and in our daily action. We testing our limits for example with diets and fastenings. Sure there are slight adjustments for everybody’s health situation included, because one have to be ready for certain steps.
Basically we walk the talk, and not just signpost the path and let the others walk it… (Aquarian Gospel 15:15)

Friends Southwest Center is an intentional residential community on 64 acres of land in the very SE corner of Arizona, USA.  The community was founded by Quakers from Tucson 35 years ago and remains small but vital today.  The founding principles of non-violence, harmony, living gently on the earth, and consensus decision making still inform our daily life and business decisions. We have camping and rental options for travelers, small groups and interested seekers. We embrace and nurture diversity for those who want to live simply in peaceful high desert surroundings.
Some of us do &quot;guerrilla gardening&quot; as the extremes of climate and local critters take a toll on our gardens. There are several home greenhouses and a young orchard.
FSC hosts a weekly unprogrammed Quaker meeting year round. We have a Peace Park, and donate regularly to charity. We are LBGT and family friendly. We support activism in border issues and some members volunteer with ESL classes for people in Douglas and with art projects and food bank volunteering. We have contacts in Sonoran border towns in Mexico and in Hermosillo Mexico. We are located close to the Agua Prieta border crossing,Bisbee, Douglas and beautiful wildlife and natural areas like the Chiricahua National Monument. Our local airport is in big city Tucson, but our lifestyle is high desert sustainable.
It's very quiet in the summer, when the monsoon rains arrive. We often do not have enough members here to host summer visitors.

We seek a life of prayer, humility, simplicity, and voluntary poverty alongside the poor. Committed to the Catholic Worker movement, founded in 1933 by Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day, we advocate for personalism, a decentralized society, and a green revolution through nonviolence, the works of mercy, manual labor, and voluntary poverty. Eight permanent residents currently live in our Catholic Worker farm house, and our Christ Room is available nightly for temporary guests. Funds and donations are directly used for the performance of the corporeal and spiritual works of mercy, and no one in the House draws any compensation from contributions.</description>

This is a new tribe trying to get established on 9 acres of woodland and a grass meadow in south central Oregon.

The land is already being purchased but we are not currently living here. It will be a summer only camp until better accommodations can be built. It may be some time before this can be finished due to lack of funds. Check back in the future for updates.

It borders the 2 million acre Fremont National Forest with many trails and wildlife.

The object of this community is to live together in harmony and be self sufficient off the grid.

Anyone wanting to join the tribe will first have to visit and make sure that it will work for everyone involved.

      <name>New Oasis For Life ( Lifechanyuan China 2)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21735&quot;&gt;New Oasis For Life ( Lifechanyuan China 2)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; A. New Universal Values
In our community, we have a harmonious relationship between people and nature. Everyone enjoy a simple and happy life here, the instances of crimes and fights are zero. Arguments, quarrels, and conflicts are very rare.

This is because of the solid basis of the universal values we had built before the community was established. It was initiated and written by the founder Xuefeng, and since 2001, he has written more than 2500 articles with over 10 million words in Chinese. Before participating in setting up the community, all members are first resonating with the values, include the dream of creating a sustainable new life mode beyond the limits of countries, nationalities, religions, and races; and bringing people real happy, free, joyful, and blessed lives.

So this values system and the common dream are the deep roots and energy source that motivates all members of the New Oasis for Life under all circumstances.

The content of this Universal Values includes the origin of the universe, the origin of LIFE, the origin of human beings on earth, time, space, consciousness, the value, meaning and purpose of life and LIFE; the crises human beings are faced with, the nature of countries, political parties, religions, marriage and family; the non-material world, and the way of beautifying one’s soul garden etc. It absorbs the wonderful wisdoms of human history such as those of Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Muhammad, and all wisdom essences of sages and saints from different civilizations and cultures.


B. New Life Mode

We have created a new production and life mode. We share the income 100%, all resources are shared, everything belongs to the community, and there is no private property any more.  Living, shelter, eating, clothes, transportation, aging, sickness, and death are all communal responsibilities, including nursing the elderly and educating the children.

Everyone works efficiently for at least six hours one day, everyone is mostly responsible for one job, and tries to achieve it to a first-class level. People serve and treat each other equally.  Paradise management is implemented here as we believe the best management is no management. There is no management teams or leaders, there is no constitution, laws, statutes, commandments, or dharma. Each branch has only one director, whose role is to arrange and coordinate the branch’s daily production and activities.  

C. New Social System 
- One global government + university of universal values education + ecovillages lifestyle

We have a bold vision: the earth will enter into a new age where human beings will grow up to a higher level of consciousness and create a brand new social mode. Countries, political parties, religions, and traditional families will no longer exist; wars, conflicts, fights, and crimes will disappear, and all resources will be shared among people on earth. There is no private ownership any more. There will be a global government responsible for the whole management of administrative affairs on the earth, since there is no countries, political parties, traditional families any more, leaders of the global government will be chosen from the most excellent persons who are totally selfless and fair. Besides, under the universal values, the essence of different nations and cultures will be integrated into a new human beings culture, and the earth will become a harmonious planet with diversity blossoming everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/new-oasis-for-life-the-second-home-of-lifechanyuan-the-4th-branch/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/new-oasis-for-life-the-second-home-of-lifechanyuan-the-4th-branch/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our community was established in April 2009 in Yunnan China by a group of people who held common universal values and the vision of creating a new life mode for human beings to sustain themselves on earth.

Yunnan is a region that offers the best weather and rich natural resources in China. We set up three branches in two years and the community members rose from the original 20, up to 150. We did all the designing and construction, as well as raised all the funds by ourselves. After three years of construction, each branch became a very beautiful and harmonious environment with members living happily together, including 20 elder members and 14 children. We received visitors from more than 15 countries within two years.</description>

      <name>Bruderhof</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21743&quot;&gt;Bruderhof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Bruderhof is an international communal movement of families and singles who seek to put into action Christ’s command to love God and neighbor.
 
Like the first Christians described in Acts 2 and 4, we have been called to a way of life in which all are of one heart and soul, no one possesses anything, and everything is shared in common. We also draw instruction and inspiration from the Reformation era Anabaptists who revived the early Christian example of discipleship in full community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/bruderhof/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/bruderhof/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
The Bruderhof is an international communal movement of families and singles who seek to put into action Christ’s command to love God and neighbor.
 
Like the first Christians described in Acts 2 and 4, we feel called to a way of life in which all are of one heart and soul, no one possesses anything, and everything is shared in common. We also draw inspiration from the Anabaptists of the Reformation era who revived the early Christian example of discipleship in full community.
Jesus Christ and his spirit and teachings are the foundation of our community. We come from many cultures, countries, and walks of life. We have no private property but share everything in common, as the early Christians did. Each member gives his or her talents, time, and efforts wherever they are needed. Money and possessions are voluntarily pooled, and in turn each member is provided for and cared for. Meals are eaten together, and meetings for fellowship, singing, prayer, or decision making are held several evenings a week. Meetings are held in a large circle.  Someone leads each meeting, but we don't have someone preaching and everyone else listening. We are conscious of our shortcomings, yet we are committed to trying to live out Jesus’ way, not only on Sundays, but every day.
The family is the basic unit of our community, though many of our members are single adults. Marriage is upheld as a sacred vow between one man and one woman that assumes faithfulness until death. Our families and community are built on this faithfulness and commitment – to God and to each other. We value modesty and sexual purity, and expect the same of our children and guests.
Founded in 1920, our community was one of many that sprang up in Germany after World War I among young people disillusioned with a society based on competition and greed and a church that had blessed the war. Eberhard Arnold, his wife Emmy, and a circle of fellow seekers left middle-class Berlin to start a rural settlement in the spirit of early Christianity and the Radical Reformation of the early 1500s, when thousands of Anabaptists left the institutional churches to live a life of sharing and service in Christian communities. During the 1930s, Nazi persecution forced the fledgling community to resettle in England.
We believe every human life is sacred, and for this reason we are opposed to war, abortion, and capital punishment. We have a long history of pacifism and remain committed to working for peace, reconciliation, and social justice. In community we can put this into practice. We hope to show by example that it is possible for ordinary people to live a life that addresses the needs of the whole person and the root causes of injustice, war, and isolation.
At the same time we remain involved in our neighbourhoods and wider society. We support disaster relief efforts, peace projects and assist with many local activities in schools, churches and hospitals.
Children are part of the reason we live together as we do. Children need an environment in which they can remain children, unencumbered by the materialism and violence in our society. Parents have the primary responsibility for their care and education, but have the support of teachers in our school and the rest of the community. Teenagers attend local colleges before moving on to further education, voluntary service, or other work.
Membership requires a voluntary lifetime commitment, so it is a choice that can only be made as an adult. Those who grow up in the community are encouraged to spend time elsewhere so they can make a mature, independent choice.
Work is love made visible. From washing clothes in the communal laundry or teaching in the school, to weighing a baby in the community clinic or fixing a water main, our communal work is a practical expression of our love for one another. No one receives a wage or salary. We earn our living by manufacturing and selling Community Playthings (classroom furniture and play equipment).
Disabled and elderly members enrich our community with their vitality and experience, and participate in the communal work as their strength allows. Because the community (which includes members who are doctors and nurses) is like an extended family, we are usually able to care for our sick and elderly at home and whenever possible, death takes place within the supportive atmosphere of the church community.

      <name>The Barley Jar - Urban Ecovillage and Spiritual Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21744&quot;&gt;The Barley Jar - Urban Ecovillage and Spiritual Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Ecological, spiritual and social sustainability and permaculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-barley-jar/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-barley-jar/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
The Barley Jar is an evolving Plum Village inspired permaculture training and practice centre and development site, learning and practicing to live harmoniously with each other and the natural world. We aim to do this to the utmost degree possible. The community is also a kind of research and development laboratory striving to achieve the deepest level of social, spiritual and environmental permaculture based on the Plum Village Tradition and the best available science. 
Our desire is to be the change we want to see in the world.


The tradition of Plum Village and Thich Nhat Hanh is a non-denominational spiritual tradition open to individuals of any persuasion ranging from atheist to Catholic, Muslim, Jewish or similar. This tradition focuses on mindfulness in daily life. Though they arise from a Buddhist vision for a global spirituality and ethic, it's practices are nonsectarian, and their nature is universal.


We will give preference to individuals who are interested in training and deepening their practice at the Barley Jar and ultimately becoming longer term stable members of our community. We are also open to shorter term guests. Currently our community is typically comprised of 2-3 long term members and 3-4 shorter to medium term guests.


Training and deepening practice is possible through  a program of courses and activities being developed at the Barley Jar in which residents and broader community members can deepen their practice of permaculture and the Plum Village and Barley Jar traditions. These also include reading and study groups and participation in local retreats and practice opportunities.


We share meals/cooking, groceries, cleaning/chores, music/art/ideas, joint parties, community dinners, collective space and household items, a mixture of privacy and community,...We have positive shared values / enthusiasm for sustainable transportation (bikes, no cars owned), local organic, vegetarian/vegan, natural materials (plastic free), fair trade ...inclusion and diversity are highly valued and desired e.g. no labels / all ages / all abilities / queer-positive / all backgrounds / all social (including marginalized) groups etc. 


Our house is medium to large, we really like having people around as well as having a balance of privacy, we like having guests.Our members positively contribute to our community and to the network of similar homes that we are a part of. 


Physically: We live in a century home at the north end of Brunswick Ave, the house has 6 bedrooms. There are lots of shared spaces - a kitchen, 2 bathrooms, sunroom, dining room, living room, patio-deck, garden. We generally have 6-8 housemates including couples and kids...


Our members tend to be community activists, social change agents, artists and farmers.


We host:

- community wide sunday dinners once a month (last sunday of the month - potluck optional with a music jam) all are welcome
- workshops (anything and everything - politics, art, sustainability, social justice)
- music and art events (house concerts, readings and the like)
- guests from all over

    

Community Healing:

- The Barley Jar is engaged in a new exploratory healing journey which is making available a room for anyone seeking habitation in Toronto who might want to live and practice with us. The space is reserved for those who have been without a home for long periods of time ....ask for more from any of our members...</description>

      <name>Saba Cooperative at Seven Springs</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21748&quot;&gt;Saba Cooperative at Seven Springs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Health and Wellness Cooperative focused on healthy mind, body, spirit, arts and permaculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/saba-cooperative/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/saba-cooperative/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
“Saba” is translated as “tomorrow” in the tongue of the native Abenaki people and this intentional community is planned according to the needs of tomorrow:  Wholistically creating peaceful, voluntary, sustainable alternatives to meeting human needs on physical, mental, spiritual and social levels. 

Saba is a social enterprise dedicated to assisting communities with integrating cooperative housing with complementary and alternative healthcare services as well as community education on permaculture, arts, and sustainable living practices.  

Saba's mission is to assist communities with goals to becoming ecologically and economically sustainable.  Saba’s projects include the utilization of local building materials and passive and active solar collection and storage systems for energy.  Further, in this bioregion, a significant concern for structures is heat retention during the cold season.  Saba's projects use the support of nature for this purpose using earth-sheltered structure designs for the community and living quarters, as well as in the design of greenhouses.  Saba’s goal is to promote harvesting and storage of rainwater through the use of specific drainage designs and water catchment systems as well as gray water recycling.

Saba's mission is to assist with the development of sustainable food systems that meet the community’s food needs while maintaining healthy ecosystems. Saba commits to the use of permaculture principles to promote regeneration of healthy ecological conditions not only for the current community, but for generations to come. Permaculture is based on working with, not against nature and promoting human dignity and health, animal welfare, social justice and environmental sustainability.  The anticipated application of the permaculture design integrates local plants, edible forest gardening, pasture-paddock chicken raising, proper utilization of all potential waste products such as with composting, biologically diverse polyculture herb and vegetable gardens, and the utilization of natural patterns found in nature in the gardens, greenhouses, and structures.</description>

Utilizing solar photovoltaics, solar hot water, biking for transportation, gardening, fruit and nut orchard, black soldier fly composting, humanure composting, rainwater catchment, rocket stove/wood gasifier, coppicing nitrogen fixing trees for green manure, fodder, fuel, building materials, near zero waste, living simple so others can simply live.  Lacto ovo vegetarians.  60 laying chickens, 12 goats, 1 dog, 5 cats.

We are deep ecology, sustainable  homestead that incorporates Organic, Sustainable,  Permaculture,  Regenerative Agroforestry,  Agroecological principals in order to live within the means of the land.  We live more simply so others (*human and other species”) can simply live.  Popai has evolved into a sustainable living and educational project..I’m an idealist and would like to live in a fair, sustainable, healthy planet where we are wise stewards and reawaken to our interdependency in the web of life, and the necessity of “care giving”/leaving/giving back .  We seek to take only what we need and to live within the means of 3.5 acres available per person on the Earth, which is our Earth Fair Share amount of space to live within the carrying capacity of the biologically productive land and sea.  Three acres provides just food, modest shelter and a small amount of energy to cook food, but not for transportation, eating meat, or for cash crops (coffee, tea, chocolate, tobacco, meat [or crops like soy and corn used to feed livestock], sugar, oil crops/palm/canola, cotton, flowers, monocropped forests/eucalyptus, biofuels for cars).   I’m not talking about the amount of acreage ones house is on but the space needed to manufacture all of their needs  That means we have  to live simply and only require 3.5 acres to provide all of our needs for food, fiber, fuel, fodder, fineries, fencing, fun, pharmacy, and shelter.    In order to live fairly we have to practice “willful restraint”, lower our standard of living/consumption, stop the use of dirty inappropriate technologies, reduce our human populations, and reduce our land space requirements from e.g. 25 acres  per person in the U.S. to 3.5.  We are currently “six planet living” when there is only one Earth, so in order to co create a fair, sustainable, and healthy planet we have to learn to live “One planet living”. Our industrial society is a planetary plaque, a cancer,  with all of the social, medical and environmental  ills (war, crime, drugs, terrorists, have/have nots, cancer, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Asthma, Allergies, pollution of our soil, water and air,  soil erosion,  soil impoverishment,  6th wave of species extinction, 150 species going extinct daily, 35,000 people starving each day,  etc.) and we accept, acquiesce, accommodate to  the side effects of our rapacious, “taker”  society, just like a frog who is placed in warm water and slowly brought up to a boil without a struggle.

Founded in 1968 by disciples of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada, New Vrindaban became the first rural farming community of the Hare Krishna movement in the U.S.

In the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia, about one hour from Pittsburgh, PA thousands of visitors from all religions and nationalities  come annually to have a spiritual retreat and partake of the many festivals. People also like to attend work parties to get hands on experience in our certified organic gardens.

New Vrindaban is a great opportunity for WWOOFERS, Help Exers, Work Exchangers to not only learn and share experiences in farming and caring for the Earth but to also hike and bike our 2,000 wooded acres.  Many streams and creeks are available for a swim on a hot day.

The spiritual aspects, based on the Vedic ancient holy texts of India, make for a well rounded body, mind and soul experience.  The diet is lacto vegetarian.  Proper care for the cows who provide us with milk and manure for our gardens is very important.

      <name>Immaculate Conception Benedictine Priory</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21756&quot;&gt;Immaculate Conception Benedictine Priory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Ecumenical Benedictines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/immaculate-conception-benedictine-priory/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/immaculate-conception-benedictine-priory/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ecumenical Benedictine Community within the catholic tradition whose mission is to pray constantly and work for the reconciliation and unity of Christians.
Our Priory in formation welcomes those with a call for reconciliation and unity in order to make possible the desire of Christ &quot;that all may be one&quot; (Jn. 17). Our monastic community is above all else a reconciled community within itself. Being reconciled, allows us to embark in the work of reconciliation and unity of Christians.
The Ecumenical Mission of this Priory is rooted in sane teachings and tradition of the church of Christ:
“…The attainment of union is the concern of the whole Church, faithful and shepherds alike. This concern extends to everyone, according to his talent, whether it be exercised in his daily Christian life or in his theological and historical research. This concern itself reveals already to some extent the bond of brotherhood between all Christians and it helps toward that full and perfect unity which God in His kindness wills.

There can be no ecumenism worthy of the name without a change of heart. For it is from renewal of the inner life of our minds, from self-denial and an unstinted love that desires of unity take their rise and develop in a mature way. We should therefore pray to the Holy Spirit for the grace to be genuinely self-denying, humble. gentle in the service of others, and to have an attitude of brotherly generosity towards them. St. Paul says: &quot;I, therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and meekness, with patience, forbearing one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace&quot;.  This exhortation is directed especially to those raised to sacred Orders precisely that the work of Christ may be continued. He came among us &quot;not to be served but to serve&quot;.
&lt;/div&gt;

      <name>Community of St. Isidore</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21765&quot;&gt;Community of St. Isidore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; spirituality service sustainability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/st-isidore-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/st-isidore-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Isidore the Laborer (1070-1130), was a beloved Christian saint, known for his love to the poor and to the animals.  He is considered the patron saint of farmers, day laborers, and rural communities.  Our goal at St Isidore is to live together in community, supporting each other along life's journey, finding ways we can serve and help others in need.  Ideally we would share several  meals together throughout the week, and have a little bit of time each day for daily prayer.  We would like to start by buying a house in the city of Battle Creek, Michigan, with enough yard space to do some organic gardening. 

As of February, 2016, we are still looking for interested individuals.  It would be great if we could get going either in 2017 or 2018.

Please call or e-mail if you might be interested in joining.  We look forward to hearing from you!  You also might want to consider joining the Meet-up Group:  http://www.meetup.com/Battle-Creek-Intentional-Community-St-Isidore/

      <name>HeartTribe Village &amp; Chrysalis</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21766&quot;&gt;HeartTribe Village &amp; Chrysalis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; eco-spiritual living, loving and healing through deep listening and heart-connection with all beings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/hearttribe-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/hearttribe-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
We are currently forming HeartTribe Village based on a 5th dimensional paradigm for community living. As we join Gaia in her ascension process during The Great Shift that is in progress now, we too must shift and change and let go of old ways that no longer serve the good of all. It is time to open our hearts, witness our emotions, heal our pain bodies, transcend our egos, and live authentically in harmony with all living beings based upon love. 

We are starting with a small group of Wise Women who are embodying the Divine Feminine, learning to matrix surf,  and shifting our DNA through various shamanic practices and quantum technologies. We are learning to witness our egos and rise above them as we center in our Inner Wise Selves and live from the heart. Each Wise Woman is going within to do our inner journey work during the fall and winter of 2016-2017.  By the fall equinox of 2017, we plan to each build or acquire a mobile tiny home with which we can eventually form a caravan and have our first gathering. This will enable us to be flexible and go with the Flow of Earth changes and Cosmic events as well as political and economic upheaval.  

HeartTribe will be a communal, residential non-profit community that is resource-based and built on a foundation of joyous co-creation with Gaia and all who live upon her. We are invoking the energies of the Divine Feminine &amp;amp; of the devic realms. We are taking full responsibility for our creations both individually and collectively. Most importantly, we are learning to live from our hearts and in unconditional love so that we may model a new paradigm for the planet based in a gifting economy philosophy known in Africa as &quot;Ubuntu&quot;.  

Eventually we intend to build &quot;hobbit-style&quot; Earth Houses(partly underground) and become 100% off-grid. Everything we do is intended to be in harmony with the local nature spirits (as they have done at Findhorn, Sirius, and Perelandra) and a co-creative venture where deep listening is paramount. We also embrace the ancient Mayan idea that &quot;time is art&quot; and plan to practice and model a more natural way of flowing with time rather than the current artificial clock. 

Central to our vision is also the desire to create a spiritual retreat center in the central common house dome called &quot;Chrysalis&quot;. This will be a place where people can come and &quot;cocoon&quot;, witness a new way of life, and be supported in their own personal &quot;metamorphosis&quot;. Those who live in HeartTribe will serve as the staff, teachers, and healers who facilitate Chrysalis retreats, events, art workshops and playshops.  This Chrysalis will be like a an ashram where people find that their guru is within. 

We are envisioning using wind/solar/&amp;amp; geothermal power as well as creating innovative perma-culture projects, shamanic rituals, composting toilets, a home-school cooperative, a labyrinth, an eco-spiritual education program, local barter exchanges, and possibly a&quot;living machine&quot; to process gray waters.

We envision starting out with a village of 7 tiny homes and  building others as the demand arises. All members will be trained in spiritual empowerment &amp;amp; cooperative decision-making skills. We hope to begin building by 2018 once the appropriate location is determined somewhere in upstate NY. 

It is time as the Tribe of Many Colors to create the future we all dream of because We are the Ones we have been waiting for:)

      <name>New Oasis For Life ( Lifechanyuan China 1)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21771&quot;&gt;New Oasis For Life ( Lifechanyuan China 1)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; A. New Universal Values
In our community, we have a harmonious relationship between people and nature. Everyone enjoy a simple and happy life here, the instances of crimes and fights are zero. Arguments, quarrels, and conflicts are very rare.

This is because of the solid basis of the universal values we had built before the community was established. It was initiated and written by the founder Xuefeng, and since 2001, he has written more than 2500 articles with over 10 million words in Chinese. Before participating in setting up the community, all members are first resonating with the values, include the dream of creating a sustainable new life mode beyond the limits of countries, nationalities, religions, and races; and bringing people real happy, free, joyful, and blessed lives.

So this values system and the common dream are the deep roots and energy source that motivates all members of the New Oasis for Life under all circumstances.

The content of this Universal Values includes the origin of the universe, the origin of LIFE, the origin of human beings on earth, time, space, consciousness, the value, meaning and purpose of life and LIFE; the crises human beings are faced with, the nature of countries, political parties, religions, marriage and family; the non-material world, and the way of beautifying one’s soul garden etc. It absorbs the wonderful wisdoms of human history such as those of Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Muhammad, and all wisdom essences of sages and saints from different civilizations and cultures.



B. New Life Mode

We have created a new production and life mode. We share the income 100%, all resources are shared, everything belongs to the community, and there is no private property any more.  Living, shelter, eating, clothes, transportation, aging, sickness, and death are all communal responsibilities, including nursing the elderly and educating the children.

Everyone works efficiently for at least six hours one day, everyone is mostly responsible for one job, and tries to achieve it to a first-class level. People serve and treat each other equally.  Paradise management is implemented here as we believe the best management is no management. There is no management teams or leaders, there is no constitution, laws, statutes, commandments, or dharma. Each branch has only one director, whose role is to arrange and coordinate the branch’s daily production and activities.  

C. New Social System 
- One global government + university of universal values education + ecovillages lifestyle

We have a bold vision: the earth will enter into a new age where human beings will grow up to a higher level of consciousness and create a brand new social mode. Countries, political parties, religions, and traditional families will no longer exist; wars, conflicts, fights, and crimes will disappear, and all resources will be shared among people on earth. There is no private ownership any more. There will be a global government responsible for the whole management of administrative affairs on the earth, since there is no countries, political parties, traditional families any more, leaders of the global government will be chosen from the most excellent persons who are totally selfless and fair. Besides, under the universal values, the essence of different nations and cultures will be integrated into a new human beings culture, and the earth will become a harmonious planet with diversity blossoming everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/new-oasis-for-life-the-second-home-of-lifechanyuan-the-1st-branch/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/new-oasis-for-life-the-second-home-of-lifechanyuan-the-1st-branch/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our community was established in April 2009 in Yunnan China by a group of people who held common universal values and the vision of creating a new life mode for human beings to sustain themselves on earth.

Yunnan is a region that offers the best weather and rich natural resources in China. We set up three branches in two years and the community members rose from the original 20, up to 150. We did all the designing and construction, as well as raised all the funds by ourselves. After three years of construction, each branch became a very beautiful and harmonious environment with members living happily together, including 20 elder members and 14 children. We received visitors from more than 15 countries within two years.</description>

      <name>Providence Zen Center</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21779&quot;&gt;Providence Zen Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; residential Zen practice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/providence-zen-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/providence-zen-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Providence Zen Center is a residential spiritual community founded in 1972 by the Korean Zen Master Seung Sahn to provide a place where his students could live and practice Zen together.  In 1979 we moved to our current location about 20 minutes from the heart of Providence in rural Cumberland RI. 

Most residents work outside the community and pay a monthly training fee (currently $675).  This fee covers all primary living expenses (room, food, utilities).  Food is bought and shared by the community, and community meals are cooked for the community several times a week on a primarily volunteer basis.  The remainder of meals are prepared individually. Our spiritual practice is modeled after the practices of the Korean Zen tradition.  Zen meditation practice consisting of sitting meditation, chanting, and bowing is offered twice daily in the early morning and evening, and residents are encouraged to practice together daily as their work schedule permits.  In addition, residents may attend monthly weekend retreats as well as longer retreats held twice yearly in the summer and winter:  these retreats are available to residents at no additional cost.  We also have a large non-residential community which visits the center to attend practice, retreats, or other community events, and we offer our hospitality to other spiritual groups which rent our facilities to host their own retreats.  

As a community we are committed to working towards greater sustainability.  To this end we are transitioning to purchasing as much organic and local food as our budget allows, growing some of our own produce in the garden and greenhouse, and keeping chickens to help provide eggs for the community.  We have installed low watt florescent fixtures and bulbs throughout the buildings. We are also working to retrofit the buildings to make heating in the winter more energy efficient. Last fall we replaced the remaining single pane windows in the original wings of the building with energy star rated replacement windows. In addition to this, we work to foster greater connection with the wider spiritual community through participation in ecumenical and interfaith groups, and have hosted interfaith retreats.
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21780&quot;&gt;Micah's House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Life Together&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/micahs-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/micahs-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We exist as a Christ-centered, egalitarian intentional community in Birmingham, AL pursuing pillars of hospitality, nonviolence, discipleship and simplicity in our neighborhood of East Lake.

Micah's House was birthed out of an artistic collective called Emuna. Through Emuna we began our journey of pursuing a consistent life ethic, confronting the challenging parts of our unexamined lives and making decisions in order to embody the faith we all claim. Six of us moved into a huge house on the Southside of town but through many transformative experiences that have challenged virtually every part of us, individually and communally, we have settled and started to grow roots in East Lake, Birmingham. In September 2012 we acquired a house in South East Lake, and in April of 2013 we dedicated the Ambrose/Sales House to the work of the community in memory of our friends, Rick Ambrose and Dick Sales - both tireless advocates for peace and justice in Birmingham and around the world.

As part of our shared life together, each week we set aside Monday and Thursday nights for community dinner at 7:00 PM - all are welcome. Additionally, on Saturday evenings, as we are able, we peace vigil with a group of veteran peacemaker friends in Birmingham's 5 Points South at 5PM, followed by dinner at New China Town at 6PM. Frequently we partner with PHADP, JAM, Pax Christi, Mary's House, Arise, ACIJ and GBM in pursuit of justice for all Alabamians.

At times Micah's House has consisted of as many as eight adults and three children living and sharing a common life together. At present, the community is in a time of transition as the majority of community members are in the process of pre-arranged moves necessitated by previous commitments and future endeavors. As a result, we have space available for new short-term and long-term residents and those interested in pursuing our life together. For more information, read through &quot;Our Life Together&quot; (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1DVcWj3bhSDUnpJVFdFWGZjVWs/edit?usp=sharing) if you feel you may be interested in connecting with us. Also, check out the &quot;Rule&quot; tab of our website, where you can find our communal commitments, our shared values and vision documented. In essence we seek to holistically embody the gospel: loving God, loving each other, loving our neighbor.

Visitors are welcome, if you are interested in coming please contact us at community@micahshouse.com.

Cultural diversity with spiritual consciousness is essential - welcoming each other with respect, kindness, learning and understanding.  This also includes people of all ages and abilities, and of any economic status.

Living and working together in community is a spiritual practice, where co-operation means with each other... and with guidance from each person's inspiration (co-operation with spirit, as any artist knows), and then also verified by consensus among members of the community.  Depending on viewpoint, there are no leaders, or everyone is a co-leader.

Each person's time is equally valuable, by definition.  Maximum 'free' time for healing &amp;amp; creative work.  Minimal overhead of all types, including community meetings &amp;amp; chores.

Ecological appropriate technology, and off-grid independence from conventional 'resources'.

Proposed resident population of 10 to 50, including students, with additional capacity for hundreds of visitors during public events.  Non-resident membership is limited by the size of the universe.

Proposed community resources, projects, businesses - theatre &amp;amp; art gallery, restaurant &amp;amp; bakery, greenhouse, gardens &amp;amp; housing around the community.

Proposed experiential 'non-school' open educational environment - including music/dance/theatre, media-art production, ecological &amp;amp; appropriate technology, holistic health...

We are something very old renewed. Located in the Catskill Mountains of Upstate New York, we have slightly over three acres of land, a 120+ year old former resort inn and building towards as much self sufficiency as we can.

We are a community of Goddess spiritual oriented women, are incorporated as a 501C3 religious charitable organization and we are trying to build a new/old way of living as a community.  If that sounds good, contact us.

We have a full ceramics studio, adding looms and other handicrafts.  We have an in house movie theatre. Living here means sharing the expenses and work to maintain our property and doing so in a Goddess oriented manner.  We are located in a tiny hamlet so having your own car is a definite plus.

If you are interested, come spend a week with us so we can see if we all mesh.  All sexual orientations are welcome and we are transsexual positive but you must be fully transitioned and woman identified.  Men are welcome to visit and often do.  We are very feminist oriented, service oriented and social justice oriented.

You do not have to be a member of our religious tradition to live here but should be comfortable with it.  No dogs, multiple kitty residents.  There is an outdoor Temple/Grove in the back and a generic Pagan style circle as well as a small dome available for retreats

Our plan has developed and been refined over the years as we moved from a &quot;hobby&quot; to a serious project.  Now, we believe the plan is mature and ready to be put into action.
The plan involves a &quot;proprietary community&quot;, an &quot;Improvement District&quot; and a &quot;Special Taxing District&quot;.
This is a successful plan.  It dates back to 1966 when an Improvement District and Special Taxing District for the formation of the Reedy Creek Improvement District were created.
The District has control over water, waste disposal, airport facilities, transportation, public utilities, and roads - the civic goods normally provided by cities and counties.
And just who is the Reedy Creek Improvement District?
You may have already visited there...
Walt Disney Corporation (WDC) owns 98% of the land in the District, thus controlling the Improvement District.
Yes... Walt Disney World.
Walt Disney World, the world-famous resort, is a proprietary community, a corporation running a retail community and transient residential communities.
This is the basis of our plan.  We plan to seek a similar arraingement with the government of Texas to facilitate our &quot;propietary community&quot; and &quot;corporate business venture&quot;.
Everything else is &quot;costuming&quot; for a community built from the ground up to be sane, sustainable, and human.
We welcome everyone to investigate us!  We may be odd, but sometimes the best idea is that oddest one!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21800&quot;&gt;Simone Weil and Peter Maurin House Monastic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; silence, inner and outer work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/simone-weil-and-peter-maurin-house-monastic/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/simone-weil-and-peter-maurin-house-monastic/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Simone Weil and Peter Maurin House – Monastic (Catholic Worker’s “Little Monastery”) of a non-dogmatic  and  non-denominational  orientation;
founded  and  established between 2009 -2011.

&quot;a Library of books and films – in a House of Silence&quot;  -  which provides environment for inner work towards  living in true communion with God; in  His  Truth  about  life,  reality  and  the  world.  (Repentance, prayer, Knowledge, inner healing.)
Simple –“of old way”- life in the House (and learning it). A small garden.

The purpose of this House is
-  to further the aims and goals of the Catholic Worker movement as expressed by Dorothy Day and, particularly, as expressed by Peter Maurin;
-  to join in works and efforts of the newly established (in 2004) New Monastic
Movement    (please check:  NewMonasticism.org);
-  to follow in the footsteps of the Madonna Houses (founded by Catherine de Hueck Doherty;  and as expressed by her in the book ”Pustinia”)
-  to learn  about, draw from-and follow- the examples of the other deeply rooted in God spiritual/ religious monastic or life-communities; - the ancient Essenes, or the Bruderhof, or Amish and Hutterites;
-  to live as one unique small monastic community
          as a response to God’s call – for repentance and  &quot;conversion&quot;;  and then for living a way of love -  which will bring fruits of truth, justice, and peace.

If you are interested in our mission,  inquire about the situation by calling and coming for few days-to two weeks  of  orientation.
In  the beautiful  House-setting  there  is  a  room  for  one  person  for  a  longer-term stay (half-a-year to  a  year  or  more),  and  a room  for one - for a shorter-term stay .

We curate spaces of healing and reconciliation, the primary space is our worshiping community the Oratory of Jesus Christ Reconciler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-community-of-the-holy-trinity/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-community-of-the-holy-trinity/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
We are an Intentional Christian community on Chicago's North side. The Community of The Holy Trinity is a community centered around the life of prayer seeking to offer support and hospitality to artists, social activists and social workers, and to offer group and individual spiritual direction as we walk along side brother's and sisters in Christ on the journey of faith.
The community has been in existence since 2003.  On September 6 2014 3 members two of our founding members established the Order of Jesus Christ, Reconciler (OJCR) and professed permanent vows as founding members of OJCR with two others residing in Detroit.  The order has a charism of Reconciliation. At that time the Community of the Holy Trinity became the first and founding House of the Order of Jesus Christ Reconciler.  
OJCR is in the process of founding a House of the Order in Detroit.  The Community of the Holy Trinity as a House of the order

      <name>Order of the Shepherd's Heart</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21825&quot;&gt;Order of the Shepherd's Heart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To be a model of ecological living within a Celtic Christian monastic ethos, committed to nonviolence, egalitarianism, and diversity; practicing radical hospitality, spiritual mysticism, and sustainable living, through a generous orthodoxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/order-of-the-shepherds-heart/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/order-of-the-shepherds-heart/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Order of the Shepherd’s Heart is an ecumenical covenant community which, while being birthed by the Celtic Christian tradition, is a part of the Free Catholic Movement within Christ Catholic Church Archdiocese of the Prince of Peace.  We are Celtic in spirit, ecumenical in scope, and celebrate a deeply mystical and sacramental approach to the Christian faith.  Shepherd's Heart is composed of men and women in single, celibate, committed, and or open lifestyles who have been called as a domestic and monastic spiritual family into deep love relationships with and in Jesus Christ. Jesus is our example; the Scriptures are our rule; Love is our law.

The Order does not exist to govern every detail of the members’ lives, but to provide support and love, direction and shared experience, encouragement and constructive criticism in our never-ending quest to become “the glory of God: the human person fully alive.”

True to our motto: “Rege Quod est Devium – Bring Back the Wandering” we strive to offer safe pasture and sanctuary within our Order for all wandering Christians who would seek a more intimate union with God and one another. To these ends we offer our Order to any and all who would want to struggle with us to live such a life of “intentional intimacy,” being radically inclusive and turning no one away.

While recognizing the goodness of all creation and humankind, the life of the community is intentionally counter-culture. We are an alternative society living within and alongside the modern secular society, without being a part of it. We are also an expression of renewal and reform within the Church.

Being inclusive, we practice radical hospitality and do not discriminate and hold no regard for a person’s race, color, age, gender, sexual orientation, preference, relationship status, nationality, socioeconomic class, nor a person’s state of grace. We are fully committed to inclusivity and our support for the LGBTQIAPP (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, intersexual, asexual, pansexual, polyamorous) and anyone who would seek to find a spiritual home within the Shepherd’s Heart is unwavering and unapologetic.

We strive to be a model of ecological living as well as an example of what it means to be a Celtic Christian, following the Prince of Peace in the 21st century. We are committed to nonviolence, egalitarianism, diversity, radical hospitality, spiritual mysticism, sustainable living, and a generous orthodoxy.

The Community is a 50-unit apartment complex on 5 acres and is part of the network of Ananda Communities worldwide. Residency is open to all who are sincere and open to the practice of meditation and yoga in the tradition and teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda (author of “Autobiography of a Yogi”). There are approximately 75 adults and 20 children in residence. There are both community and individual gardens. Residents can grow vegetables, fruit, and flowers; the grounds include ornamental landscaping, large trees, a swimming pool, a nature trail, and a lawn for gatherings and play. A separate community center provides space for meditation and yoga, classes and gatherings, banquets, and more. A community kitchen is run by residents and provides regular vegetarian dinners each week, open to friends and visitors as well as residents. Nearby, the Ananda Portland Temple and Teaching Center in Beaverton offers classes in meditation, yoga and spiritual development. The first Ananda Community was established in 1968 by Swami Kriyananda, direct disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda, near Nevada City, California, USA.
Residents rent their own apartments. Rents are set by local market rates for comparable apartments. On-site co-managers handle day-to-day needs, with the help of periodic community work days and volunteer participation. The complex is owned by a supportive group of investors and leased to the local Ananda organization for the operation of an intentional spiritual community.</description>

We will be purchasing land in Central Eastern Texas. All members must be vegetarian or vegan, and committed to the gradual development of sustainability and simpler lifestyles in practical ways. Intoxication, including alcohol, is not allowed. 

Modern conveniences are acceptable in moderation, and as we gradually gain experience in natural lifestyles less &quot;conveniences&quot; become necessary. 

The residential portion of the community will consist of individually-owned households on 1 or 1.5 acres each, grouped into villages of 8 households, with a village common area in the center. Each household's land is around the village, like the spokes of a wheel. Land should be productively used, for personal use or for barter within the community. Everyone must grow some percentage of their food. 

Stabilized compressed earth block is our first choice in construction method, second is Earthbag. Electricity and water are available via rainwater harvesting and solar panels within each household. A well will be dug in each village, for agricultural use. The community lake is for recreational and aesthetic purposes, but the water can be used in time of emergency. 

Governance will be by consensus at the village level and the community level. The community will have broader rules, and each village may have more specific rules according to the resident's own choosing, within the parameters of the community rules.

Newly forming intentional Christian Community, looking for co-founders with similar visions.

We have 240 acres just south of Abilene, Texas.  Its attributes are:  180 arable, good soil, soon to be organic certified, good subsurface water, more than a mile of woodland trails along Elm Creek, great wind and sun resources, city limits of Abilene just 2 miles away (great for veggie sales or a PYO operation).

The vision:  We would like to live in a community together with like-minded believers in order to:  have the benefits of a real community, share resources, fellowship, and to minister to our community.  

The details:  My vision is of a sustainable community of mostly closely spaced adobe houses (which are perfect for this part of the world -goggle compressed earth blocks) utilizing solar and wind power to the extent possible and practical, and trying to create small scale agriculture and craft industries to make income and to bring neighbors into the community.   Central housing area surrounded by gardens, farms and grazing land.  I'm partial to children, so I'd like to find a way to house a few foster families (rescue the children).

The legal structure:  Probably a non-profit together with a LLC.  

The legal details:  In Texas municipalities have a ETJ (Extra Territorial Jurisdiction) that gives them the right to set development standards 5 miles out from their city limits.  That effects this effort because to sell smaller than 10 acre lots will have prohibitive development requirements.  Therefore, the lots have to be 10 acres or we would have to just have the land owned by an LLC, with 99 year leases to the members.  This would allow improvements to be owned, but the real estate would remain the property of the LLC.  Other advantages of this:  limit equity aquisition (we need to be making homes, not building equity) and we have some control over the buyers of property (they must be approved as members of the community first).  Maybe the sale of a few 10 acre lots to founders in order to capitalize the community.

My Influences (so you'll know better who I am):  Jesus, the Bible, Wendell Berry, Our Suburban Nation, Joel Salatin,  George MacDonald

We are Modern-Day Plain Pioneers

A group of Modern-Day individuals and/or families working together to live a self sufficient, off grid, organic, all natural, plain, old fashioned, simple life. With Amish and Mennonite LIKE attitudes, morals and values, a plain, simple group. We share many commonalities and values similar to the aforementioned groups while expressing some very different views. 

A few examples of the differences are: we do not require any individual to live a non-resistant life, wear a head covering or submit to specific dress codes except while staying at our home.

 You may drive a vehicle, use Internet and electricity in your home. Those choices belong to each individual, although modesty is always required. 

In our home the ladies wear simple, modest dresses below the knees and head covers. (1st Corinthians 11) 
Aprons are often worn by the ladies. The men wear long pants most times, shorts must come to the knees. No sleeveless shirts, no print, brand labels or advertisements on clothing.  Men keep their hair short, facial hair is a personal choice. The ladies keep their hair long and pinned up under a cover. 

Visitors would be asked to conform to our dress code while staying at our homestead. Full time residents whom own their own place and live at their own places full time, can set their own guidelines. More detailed information will be provided during the interview process. 

Musical instruments, travel, higher education and technology are not forbidden. Each family should decide what influences and to what extent they feel are best for them. We do encourage every person to guard themselves from being exposed to too much modern stress, becoming imprisoned or dependent on modern conveniences. 

In our home we do not have TV, but we will watch some DVDs. You won't find a curling iron, makeup or a toaster oven. Video games are very rare indeed. Instead you will find us shucking corn together outside or hoeing the garden rows, mowing grass, weaving rugs, splitting firewood or churning butter....  We even observe electricity-FREE days each month. 

Men and women have separate work projects and sleeping areas. We have gender specific roles and are VERY conservative. Our homestead functions like the old fashioned pioneer homesteads. Leave your modern attire, music and such, carefully packed away in your car or better yet: leave it at home before you come visit us. 

We prefer old fashioned clothing, music and activities from the pioneer days. Think: Little House On The Prairie

Grace is said at every meal, church on Sunday's. We may have a glass of wine with dinner but no exorbitant alcohol use. Smoking is frowned upon and drugs are strictly forbidden. 


We are Holy Spirit filled Christians. We keep the bible in it's entirety, and the leading voice of the precious Holy Spirit as our guide for life. We attend a local Mennonite church but are not members. 

If you are leaving the Amish or Mennonite groups and wish to keep with a plain lifestyle, you may feel comfortable here. If you are seeking to join a community that is similar in ways to the Amish or Mennonites, you may feel comfortable here. If you have always felt that you were born 100 years too late, you may feel comfortable here. 

A lifestyle of living off the land, making your own from nature and old fashioned hand tools. We use tractors and engines as needed. Raising your own foods, animals and using them to feed your family. Not dependent on &quot;the system&quot;, but free from the imprisonment of it.

Deriving freedom from your own land and networking with like minded people to accomplish the common goals.

We would like to form a local, living, breathing, community, made up of hard working, able bodied, committed people to live and work together. We can develop friendships as well as depression proof homesteads. Share meals, joys, worship services and hardships together. Occasionally offering a work-to-stay program. 

Children can grow up in the proper care of parents and good friends, and will be home schooled by the loving care of their parents. Your bodies nourished from the bountiful fruits of the land. Health protected from illness and sicknesses treated by nature.

Come pioneer this group and live like the REAL Pioneers did.
We are seeking individuals and families that want to live within driving
distance of each other. Encouraging private property ownership, but willing to accommodate a small number of people on our land short term, with the intention of helping them to relocate here on their own property.

At present we have 6 families within our network, of a 3 mile radius. We have 1 male farm-hand apprentice, living at our homestead full time. 

We observe a reasonably set schedule:
M-Sat
Up at 5am
Ready to work by 6am
Breakfast from 8-9am
Back to work by 9am
Lunch from 12-1pm
Free time from 1-4pm
Meal prep 4pm
Dinner and fellowship from 5-7pm
Clean up/projects until 8pm
*Sundays are subject to church, project plans and weather. 
*All visitors and residents are required to participate in activities according to the above schedule. 

(You should be dressed, hair pinned up and covered, ready for work by 6am each morning)

We will be accepting applications for visitors to stay short term on a work exchange basis. You will have space for primitive camping, 3 meals PER WORK DAY and training/hands on education in day to day simple living skills, in exchange for your free labor. Limited internet access. 

Minimum visiting periods are 3 days, more commonly people stay for 1-2 weeks. If we all get along well, you could be invited to stay longer and/or return later. Best times of the year for visiting is between April through October. Be prepared to work outside mostly. This is rice country and we are surrounded by flooded fields that breed heavy swarms of Mosquitos. We recommend you begin a sulphur regimen 30 days before coming here. 

You don't work- you don't eat. If you take a day off, you will have to fend for yourself. Full water/electric/Internet/camping privileges as well as 3 hefty, home raised/home made meals per day= 4-6 hours of work from each adult per day. The amount of hours work to earn your keep varies depending on your skill level and abilities. 

Please email us with your interest for this type of opportunity. We will return your email with an interview process, application and further requirements. A minimum of 2 weeks notice before intended arrival is requested. 

Please tell us all about yourself and your family. Tell us how you are actively working towards a more self sufficient life. We would be interested to know how self sufficient you are now, and how far you are seeking to go!

The purpose of this community will be to provide a way for people to live wholesome, productive, sustainable lives.  A cooperative lifestyle can do this - I've seen it - living in a way that reduces the illusion of separateness - from the spirit, from the earth and from each other. To this end, I would like to establish a community of people with faith in The One Great Spirit, who are vegan/vegetarian and who are pacifists (interdependent, no?)  I've been saving for this for many years and have purchased 5.5 acres of bottom land with a beautiful creek about 5 miles from Columbia, a semi-progressive college town in central Missouri.  I've invested just about my entire retirement savings in this and would expect a similar investment from anyone who wishes to join.

If you meet the three criteria and are ready to begin the adventure, contact me.  I'll serve as a message center until/if we need an email list or web site.  Contact information on my web site (www.centralmissourigrainsforfood.com).

Update: Building a barn, trying to establish gardens and native tree orchards.

Update: I found a great book on communities: Diana Leafe Christian's &quot;Creating a Life Together&quot;.  This book covers well all of the issues encountered in forming a community.

In 2015 we completed our subdivision process and sold 5 3-acre lots within the ecovillage to like-minded friends into personal growth and sustainability.  The community owns a 10 acre parcel in the back of the subdivision.  We started building in 2016.  We now have a beautiful dance/yoga/multipurpose space with an 1800 sq. ft. wooden dance floor as well as dining for 60, a glorious wood-fired hot tub, tons of food from the land such as: papayas, mangos, avocados, bananas, and many other exotic fruits.  

The vision is for the Lolia Community LLC to own title to the property and lease the land to the Lolia Foundation which will run the center and host courses and events that support our values.  We invite wwoofers and interns to join us and have an extended opportunity to live the practices of conscious sensuality and permaculture on a daily basis.

We are located near Kehena Beach, a clothing optional black sand beach and is an awesome place for yoga, swimming, snorkeling, and often frequented by dolphins who love to swim with people.  We are a 20 minute drive from our local town of Pahoa and 45 minutes from the city of Hilo and the airport.  The biking along the Puna coast on the red road is wonderful.
  
We share space so there is an opportunity to realize our true nature in the reflection of others.  There is plenty of space in nature around here for times of solitude, reflection and grounding.  There is also time to make money working in or outside the community.

We host the annual Hawaii Tantra Festival, Conscious Sensuality courses and many other events.</description>

Greetings from a small group of friends and families lving in the community.We have a registered charity  under th rules and regulations of our Indian government to help the weeker sections in the villages and slums to show our friendship and fellowship both in words and in deeds.

We are using our small resources for the benefit of the rural community with the cooperation and coordination of our local government officials and other Non-Governmental Organasiations

A friend is one of God's greatest blessings. But friends do not just happen.

 
Please note this following;

I WENT OUT TO FIND A FRIEND, BUT COULD NOT FIND ONE THERE.I WENT OUT TO BE FRIEND AND FRIENDS WERE EVERYWHERE!

In times of trouble friends can give encouragement and understanding. In times of temporal need they can give assistance.

In times of weakness they can give much strength. In times of joy they can rejoice with us.

In times of sorrow they can give sympathy and comfort. And also they are one of the greatest motivating influences in helping us grow strong in the Lord. With a friend we can share the hidden thoughts of the heart. 

We can share joys and sorrows, happiness and despair, laugh and shed tears with out being ashamed. Solomon said, &quot; A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.&quot; (Proverbs17;17)

A friend is a friend even when we are in adverse circumstances or in trouble or in sickness.

 Friend ship does not depend upon our material situation, possessions or circumstances. Friendship knows no barriers of race, religion or social position.

When our friends have need of us- our time, our possessions-we will be thankful for the opportunity to serve, to share, to be a part of the solution, to be a concerned listener, no matter what the need may be, nor how untimely it may be for us.

We are inviting individuals and families from all over the world to join with us to love one another, and shre the recources for caring others who in need.

We request gifts and donations both in cahs and in kind for the bemnefit of the community and share to feed  and educate the poor and needy.


Friendly Yours,

Madhava,

 Founder &amp; Trustee.

Inspired by master yogi Baba Hari Dass and founded in 1981, the Salt Spring Centre of Yoga is the oldest spiritual retreat centre on Canada's west coast. We run yoga retreats and yoga teacher training programs, and we also rent our facility to like-minded groups. In addition, we also operate a small scale organic farm that helps to feed our residents and guests. Most of the work done at the Centre is on a volunteer basis, and each year we also offer multiple sessions of our 10-week residential karma yoga program, which includes instruction in yoga theory and practice. We typically have between 20 and 40 residents during the late spring, summer, and early fall, and a much smaller residential community from December through March. 

The Centre sits on 69 acres of land in the heart of scenic Salt Spring Island. Six acres are farmed organically and most of the produce goes to our kitchen for residents and guests. We have a small alternative school (K-6) and a wellness centre providing Ayurvedic and other treatments. 

We welcome applications for our Residential Karma Yoga program, and we also have periodic job opportunities that pay a small stipend that are available for skilled workers. For details, as well as information about other opportunities to stay at the Centre--like facility rentals, personal retreats and other retreats--please see our website at www.saltspringcentre.com

We are a Pagan group that follow a Kemetic Path (Religion of Ancient Egypt) and seek the Goddess in all things. Our goal is to build a place where discrimination is a thing of the past and acceptance a norm in life. This is a private community, therefore living arrangements are limited and thus, all persons interested are vetted base of community needs. Applicants must be 18 yrs of age or older. Students under 18 must have their parents apply.

      <name>Sunflower River</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21908&quot;&gt;Sunflower River&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; sustainability, spirituality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sunflower-river/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sunflower-river/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Sunflower River is joyfully creating a sanctuary wherein we embody and promote sustainability, spirituality, adaptability &amp;amp; safety within our selves, community, our land, and Gaia.

Sunflower River is a place in which we live in community, in ever-increasing harmony with our ecosystem, striving to balance the needs of that ecosystem with our own needs. It is a place of centeredness in spirit, a refuge and center for our magical workings, a sacred place. It is a place of sacred work as well as sacred play, daily bread work that we recognize as meaningful and self-sustaining, and of celebration of the cycles of nature and our lives. A place where we can strive towards self-sufficiency--growing and raising our own food, creating our own energy with sun and wind power, living in sustainable, earth-friendly dwellings, taking care of each other and sharing resources.

We act as a center for sustainability outreach, of contact with other communities engaged in sustainable or spiritual practices that touch upon ours, of the education of interested people in sustainable and/or pagan spiritual practices.

We are a small, aspiring sustainable farm, on 4 acres, 4 miles south of Albuquerque at 4900-feet elevation. We're in our eleventh year on the land.  There are five Stewards, of whom four are Founding Members, one additional  member, one child, and a diverse community of supporters who volunteer at work parties, purchase produce, and otherwise support the farm.  We are a host farm in the WWOOF internship program; see http://wwoofusa.org/. 

We have a large vegetable garden, and a half-acre of flood-irrigated pasture, but are not selling for market. Our well is off-grid. We raise chickens, turkeys, peafowl and bees. In addition, four humans, one dog, and three cats live on the property. We plan to get goats someday. Upcoming major projects include developing and improving paths on our back acreage, building a living labyrinth, and ongoing housing, greenhouse and barnyard infrastructure. 

Most of us work full-time off the farm.  We are connected by city bus and bicycle routes to Albuquerque. Our land extends back from a semi-rural highway to a tree-lined field with open views of wide green alfalfa fields and the mountains.  

We are a half-mile from the Rio Grande. We are a queer poly pagan community.

      <name>Sivananda Ashram Yoga Farm</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21909&quot;&gt;Sivananda Ashram Yoga Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Yoga and spirituality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sivananda-ashram-yoga-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sivananda-ashram-yoga-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Swami Vishnu-devananda founded the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Farm near Grass Valley, California, in 1971. The ashram provides a residential setting where spiritual practitioners of all levels can deepen their practice through the study of classical yoga, meditation and vedanta. It is part of the International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres and is a non-profit organization.  On 80 acres of rolling hills and meadows in the Sierra foothills, it offers a beautiful, secluded location, surrounded by nature.  All of the staff and teachers are volunteers.  The traditional principles underlying the life of the ashram are respect for religious differences, multi-culturalism, multi-ethnicity and multi-disciplinary study.  The Sivananda Ashram Yoga Farm blends Eastern and Western lifestyles– it is open, tolerant and disciplined a the same time. The vision of the ashram is to help all realize their highest potential and find inner peace. Inner peace will bring outer peace.

The Community is a 32-unit apartment complex on 5.5 acres and is part of the network of Ananda Communities worldwide. Residency is open to all who are sincere and open to the practice of meditation and yoga in the tradition and teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda (author of &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;). There are approximately 45 adults in residence. There are both Community and individual gardens. Residents grow vegetables, fruit, and flowers; the grounds include a chicken coop, ornamental landscaping, large trees, a swimming pool, a nature trail, and a lawn for gatherings and play. A separate structure serves as a meditation and yoga room for classes and gatherings, banquets, and much more. A Community kitchen is run by residents and provides three vegetarian dinners each week, open to friends and visitors as well as residents. Nearby Ananda Meditation Temple and a teaching center in Seattle offer two locations for classes in meditation and yoga and much more. The first Ananda Community was established in 1968 by Swami Kriyananda, direct disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda, near Nevada City, California, USA.

Residents may rent or own their apartments. Rents are set at local market rates for comparable apartments, plus residents contribute &quot;dues&quot; to support the cost of social and spiritual activities that are above and beyond what is normally provided for by comparable rents. Members of Ananda, whether in the Lynnwood community or elsewhere in the nation, formed an LLC to hold title to the property. An on-site manager and a maintenance person handle day-to-day needs, with the help of participants in periodic community work days and volunteers. The complex is leased to the local Ananda organization for the operation of an intentional spiritual community.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21933&quot;&gt;Schloss-Glarisegg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To form a new culture of encounter, consciousness and personal growth.
Authenticity. Connection. Creational Power. Transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/schloss-glarisegg/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/schloss-glarisegg/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Glarisegg Castle – “A place for encounter and consciousness” – lies between forests, a wild river, fields and Lake Constance. The community lives on a gorgeous property with large natural areas and a private beach. We are connected by a shared interest in personal responsibility and the questions of our time, and we would like to contribute to the research on new ways of living. We value synergy between personal needs and input towards a shared vision. So we set ourselves the daily challenge of finding a balance between work on communal projects and the celebration of our shared life: via communal singing and music making, regular meetings in mandatory groups and intensive periods that last several days. Our tools are, amongst others, Community Building (Scott Peck style), forums (ZEGG style), transparent communication and possibility management. In 2010 we invited new people, particularly families, for a “joining period”, so we are now in the middle of a “second set-up phase”. There is more scope for new members, too. A permaculture project with a central vegetable garden has been developing since 2012. There is a forest group for younger children. Part of the communal project is the seminar business, a small shop, as well as the creativity and instrument workshop. We are open-minded people, who see communal life as a possibility to grow together and bring a new culture into existence.</description>

We are a residential group of hermits or solitaries (and others in religious communities or domestic monasteries) living together (or alone) for the mutual benefit and protection of the whole. We have communities in MANY countries.

http://sites.google.com/site/trinityprioryinternational/

Each person is respected for the level of solitude he or she desires and great efforts are taken by all to ensure that the sanctity of that solitude is never broken under any circumstances. Members live in individual residences at the hermitage.

This is the international residential centre; we have other small residential communities in other countries. We also have training by correspondence - novitiate training for monastics, in community or in their own homes. 

We are interdenominational and for pastoral purposes us different rites e.g. Orthodox Liturgy, Western Rites, etc. We also offer silent worship or meditation.

Like all contemplatives from all religions (or none, as is the case with humanists or secularists), we focus on the present NOW moment. This practice existed for thousands of years, (long before Eckart Tolle and Oprah sensationalized it with their 500,000 members “studying” this subject on internet). Contemplatives from all faiths (like Eastern Orthodox Christians, western Christian contemplatives, centering prayer, Zen, Vedanta's self-realization, etc.) all emphasize the moment when one breathes, as the moment when alone one exists, is alive, conscious, living.

      <name>The Village on Sewanee Creek</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21943&quot;&gt;The Village on Sewanee Creek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Self-sufficient, Free, Living the Love of Christ through Service

OUR MISSION is to be a self-sustaining community
in harmony with nature and people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-village-on-sewanee-creek/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-village-on-sewanee-creek/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Sustainability at The Village on Sewanee Creek is at the intersection of creativity, personal liberty &amp;amp; accountability, love of nature and mutual caring. Private property ownership is valued as a key to accountable stewardship.  We believe that people with the right values require little in the way of intrusive oversight. We tend to be conservative or libertarian in outlook, but welcome diversity of thought, background and skills.
We seek people with diverse skills and backgrounds for self-sufficient community life in an old-fashioned neighborhood with strong Christian values.

Located on the beautiful Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee, the property abounds with waterfalls, hemlock &amp;amp; harwdood forests, clear bluff views of the Sewanee gorge and wooded mountains.  Recognized as one of the most bio-diverse areas in the US.

Why Tennessee?
• no income taxes, 
• low property taxes, 
• low cost of living,
• lush woodlands and rocky bluffs overlooking canyons and streams,
• a diverse culture, from “mountain folks” (who know how to live simply) to academia. (Nearby, Historical U. of the South -rich cultural heritage).

Villagers have diverse experience and enjoy working together and teaching each other how to be self-sufficient in:

Water: Rainwater collection systems encouraged.  Such systems make us completely independent of municipal water although city water is also available.

Food: (A community garden is maintained with help from an organic gardening coach.)  Lots are large enough to be food self-sufficient.  Some raise chickens, cows, goats or other livestock and we all share or barter.

Energy: Solar PV, Wood gasification, micro-hydroelectric, other forms of sustainable energy practiced.

Healthy living:  Use of local herbs, healthy diet.

Community: 50 of the 207 acres are a nature preserve. Hiking trails wander pristine woodlands past waterfalls to the secluded Sewanee Creek. A common area features breathtaking canyon and mountain views. Outdoor pavilions with barbecue pits welcome picnics.  A natural rock amphitheater surrounds a stage and large screen where family movies are shown against the backdrop of a dark, starlit sky.   

Located between Chattanooga and Nashville in a rural setting, with shopping, restaurants, etc., an easy 5 to 25 minutes away.

Perfect for a primary residence in a prepared community or a second-home safe haven. Home sites feature stunning bluff views, creeks, and magnificent waterfalls.

We are vegan,off grid,spiritual commune and wilderness preserve.  We seek to live simply, ecologically, self-sufficiently and in harmony with all life. We are a mystical order called the Order of the Trees. We have men and women, single and married and sometimes children. We are a spiritual commune with roots in several spiritual teachings including the Oahspe. We honor the truths that run through all religions. The Creator is our common ground. Our main activities are caring for the preserve and gardening, working with horses, and maintaining the facilities—homes, dining hall, bathhouse, stable, barn, and greenhouse. We are working toward self-sufficiency. We are off grid, producing our own heat, hot water, and electricity. Our public outreach is to provide a model of possibility, stand as guardians to one of the last old growth forests in Southern Oregon, produce publications and information on sustainability, wilderness preservation, health, vegetarianism, and spiritual development. We have just published a book about our spiritual perspectives. www.eoihsvoice.org
 
Our lifestyle does NOT include TV, radio, newspapers, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine. We are married or celibate.

We eat organic food, drink fresh spring water, breath clean air, enjoy kind people, board games, great hiking, hard work, living in a park, music and an occasional movie. 

Our land is verdant and lush, with forest and meadows and springs and a river. Our climate is mild.

We are happy, fun-loving, and positive people who want to share our community with like-minded people who love to work and grow with others.

We welcome those interested in living a simple spiritual oriented vegan life in the forest.

      <name>Catholic Ecovillage</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21957&quot;&gt;Catholic Ecovillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Catholic Community, Ecology, Mission Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/catholic-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/catholic-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Catholic Ecovillage is to be a collage of ideas forming one community.  Our vision is to bring us closer to God and our vocations, as they come forth in our individual lives.  We hope to achieve these ideas through three main ideas.
  First and foremost, is to give glory to God, through daily prayer and continual studies of the scripture. Our hope is to do this individually as well as a community.  We believe prayer and studies will draw us closer as a community.
Second, that we as a community spread our message of love.  It is important that everyone make an effort to do community work inside an outside the immediate village.  Our vision is to place Catholic Ecovillage within an area of people less fortunate.  An idea that comes to mind is in a rural area of Eastern Kentucky other Appalachian region.  Eastern Kentucky or Southern parts of Ohio are areas of interest.  Mission work could range from a number of ideas.  We envision becoming a support for other programs within these areas.  General Education(tutoring programs), Home Rehab, and Ecological or Conservation Awareness are several ideas that come to mind.  The beauty is that mission work can be anything. Many wonderful ideas of assisting others have been brought forth.  Really anything that spreads the love of Christ through action is a possibility.
Catholic Ecovillage's third idea and initial goal is to create a community.  Our eventual hope is to create a village that is environmentally and conservation-minded. We hope to create a sustainable, renewable permaculture within the space we call home.  Our goal are to find and use alternative energy, alternative building techniques, along with gardening and livestock care. Our goal is to also create a school building and place of worship within the village. We would also like to stay in close proximity to a town, and college or university. Higher Education certainly will be important.  
Our hope is to eventually have little shops, stores &amp; B&amp;B. A retreat center is another distinct possibility. These could assist with spreading our missions and ideas.


Part of the teaching of Catholicism is to strive to be more Christ like.  What better way to do this than to surround yourself with others trying to do the same? All vocations of life, single, married, families and active seniors who have something to add. Please feel free to drop and email. Begin the change in your life, through Christ and community.

The location is on the southwest coast of Finland; the closest town is Tammisaari. The environment is archipelago-countryside. 

The course center focuses on Tantra, therapy work, TRE - tension &amp; trauma releasing exercises, holistic well-being, Open floor movement practice and spiritual growth.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21968&quot;&gt;Raw-Wisdom Vegan Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Healing the Earth  &amp;amp; Ourselves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/raw-wisdom/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/raw-wisdom/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a vegan community with four spirited members plus one on the way. The Raw-Wisdom community started out by simply offering vegan, plant-based diet pot lucks for local residences, and our emphasis remains on natural, healthy, spiritual and environmentally sustainable lifestyles. We offer instructions on organic indoor and outdoor gardening, optimal plant-based nutrition, detoxification and mind/body work. We also manage the educational websites www.raw-wisdom.com and www.healingtalks.com. 

Initial Leadership: The community's reformation has been led by Nathan Batalion, PhD CTN (Certified Traditional Naturopath). Nathan is an author/blogger on health and environmental topics, as well as a nationally ranked triathlete who has 5 years of previous intentional communal living experience (The Barn, Warwick, NY). For more bio and philosophy details: http://www.healingtalks.com/about/.

Assets: The physical assets available include 16 properties. However, 14 of these properties are currently managed as rentals (though if the community expands these rented properties could be converted to community use). Oneonta is a lovely rural town with two colleges - which offers the best kind of setting if one wants to live in a cozy, slow-paced small town surrounding by large expanses of rural areas, while still having the cultural stimulation of a college center (similar to Ithaca NY, home of Cornell University). We also offer a community organic garden at one of the houses plus a composted organic garden at the main house. 

Expanding Activities: We periodically visit with and explore working with other local communities and/or healing professionals to share resources and inspirations. One way we continue to extend our network is through pot lucks or holiday meetings, educational forums, and activism on environmental and health issues. We look forward to sharing both our inner and outer wealth with like-minded, industrious, well-balanced, spiritually healthy individuals who are dedicated to transforming themselves and our culture. We can help such individuals to further transition themselves by means of following more healthy, eco and spiritually aware intentional community lifestyles. 

More on Location: Scenic Oneonta, also known as &quot;City of the Hills,&quot; is nestled within the Catskill Mountains region and along the Susquehanna River. We have plenty of fresh air, water and picturesque rural lands. Oneonta is only three hours from New York City, four hours from Philadelphia, and six hours each from Boston and Washington, DC. If you are planning to come to the general Northeast area, please don't miss visiting us.</description>

      <name>Yoga Eco-Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21969&quot;&gt;Yoga Eco-Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Yoga, Community,Healthy, Happy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/yoga-eco-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/yoga-eco-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Vision:
We are creating a vibrant and beautiful Yoga Eco-Village on the magical island of Bali,Indonesia where people can live healthy, happy, and fulfilling lives.

Our community is a place where people can live in beautiful environmental homes, among magnificent gardens with neighbors who share similar values.

We see Yoga Eco-Village as a pedestrian-oriented community of 80 to 100 people who practice organic fruit and vegetable farming, yoga, and sustainable building, and run ethical businesses.

We believe in creating a lifestyle that meets our social, economic, physical, and spiritual needs.

Principles:

•	Working together in a spirit of harmony to serve each other and humanity.
•	Ethical business: Making and using money for the benefit of society.
•	Sustainability in building, agriculture, energy, transportation.
•	Practical egalitarianism: Striving for equality while being results-oriented.
•	Collective ownership: We are shareholders in our community and businesses.
•	Service: Selfless work for the greater good of the community.
•	Universal spirituality: Yogic, eastern, Buddhist philosophies.
•	Investment of all of our money, intelligence, and heart to achieve our vision.

Community:

Our community is run for the benefit of all of its citizens.

Yoga:

Through daily living and service to each other, we are creating an environment that encourages personal growth on all levels.

Housing:

We believe in building beautiful, environmental, and long-lasting houses as naturally as possible.

Food:

Our primary goal will be to grow the most healthful, nutritious, delicious, and mineral-rich food possible. We will grow 100 percent of the fruit, nuts, and vegetables to nourish our community.

The community leans toward a vegan diet; however, people are free to eat as they choose at their own homes provided it does not interfere with others’ quality of life.

Financial:

We have chosen to use an incorporated company as the best way to hold, manage, and distribute our collective wealth.

•	We own the company as shareholders.
•	The company owns the village.
•	We rent our homes from the company (ourselves).
•	Our shares provide us with “benefits” and dividends for life.
•	We work for the company (optional).
•	The company provides us with the lifestyle we desire.
•	Shares can be earned and/or purchased.
•	Finances of individuals and the community are independent of each other.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21970&quot;&gt;Newbold House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We live in a time of unparalleled change and challenge in our global environment. Climate change, resource depletion, economic crisis, mass extinction of species, conflict and social division threaten our continued survival as a species (Macy &amp; Johnstone 2012). Global consumerism has put us on a collision course with environmental disaster (Worldwide Institute: State of the World 2010). Mental health is declining; depression and anxiety are increasing. The World Health Organisation predicts that by 2020 depression will be the second leading cause of disability throughout the world.
This is a wake up call for humanity and many of us recognise that a positive way of living and working together is urgently needed. This has been described as a ‘Life Sustaining Society’ where we can thrive personally, co-exist in harmony, feel interconnected with the living system of the planet and therefore protect and conserve this for future generations.

At the Newbold Trust we are inspired by the realisation that this is already happening at a global scale! An unnamed, self-organising movement of millions of individuals and organisations with shared values is emerging; from grassroots community led groups to large charities and social enterprises concerned with social and environmental justice, wellbeing and sustainability. It has been called the largest social movement in human history (Blessed Unrest – Hawkins 2007) and it is this movement that the Newbold Trust is part of.

To reflect this we recently revised our Vision and Mission statements. The Vision describes the movement itself, and is shared in essence by many other organisations. The Mission describes our part in this and what we are passionate about sharing with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/newbold-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/newbold-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Newbold House is run by a residential community of members and volunteers. The centre is operated by the Newbold Trust, a limited company with charitable status; dedicated to sustainability, education and open spirituality.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/21974&quot;&gt;Flatlanders Inn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; People at risk of homelessness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/flatlanders-inn/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/flatlanders-inn/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Flatlanders Inn is a diverse and intentional community located in Winnipeg's North End that seeks to cultivate a positive, nurturing, and relational place to live for people who want to get their feet back under them. 

In technical terms, Flatlanders Inn is “transitional housing for people who are at risk of homelessness.”  We invite neighborhood folk, wanderers, seekers, foreigners and those needing a positive and supportive living environment to join Flatlanders Inn.  Nonetheless, we are creating a way of life that is not solely concerned with getting people into good physical living situations.  We look at why some people become ‘at risk of homelessness’ in the first place, and ask what might have contributed to this situation.  We also concern ourselves with the whole person (taking care to address social, emotional, physical, economic, mental, and spiritual needs) and want to see healing come to every area of each person who lives here.

Flatlanders Inn is also an intentional Christian community that is a ministry of Winnipeg Centre Vineyard Church.  Each person in the community has purposefully chosen to live here and offer themselves to each other.  This means that we work at loving and respecting each other, as well as listen to, learn from, and challenge each other.  We want to build healthy relationships together, with God, and with the earth itself.  Of course there are many barriers to building healthy relationships, and part of our community life is recognizing and removing these barriers so we can grow together and as individuals.

Everyone who who lives at Flatlanders Inn’s contributes to its overall functioning and receives some of the benefits of being part of a community like ours.  We believe that everyone is created in the image of God, and that we’re all given gifts to share with one another.  We believe humans are created to be in community.

Flatlanders Inn might be comprised of families or individuals, old, young, married or single.  Ultimately, we’re creating an atmosphere that is a positive living space for shelter, healing, and growth – a safe place to work through life’s difficulties, celebrate life’s successes, and everything in between.

Our local outreach is a total immersion theatre called &quot;Circus Numen&quot; that celebrates the Universe Story and promotes the priorities of Conscious Life, including air, water, food, and energy. The CLEU offers practical resources and perspective to guide local Cleu Circles in celebrating their human rites and spiritual practices, and when ready, in becoming legal churches.  Discover the power of the circle: Set an intention, share resources, and build community infrastructure right where you live. Be the clue in your community!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/conscious-life-ecumenical-union/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/conscious-life-ecumenical-union/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our 501c3 religious organization, The Conscious Life Ecumenical Union, is here to help you find others with a clue so that you can join together to experience At-Onement by celebrating your human rites: music, art, dance, drum, song, and story, and joining together for spiritual practices, such as study, service, meditation, mentoring, and pilgrimage. Get to know other Cleu circles in your area and elsewhere. Connecting local circles with other circles will make our network strong, flexible, and resilient. As a meme, Cleu is a reminder of who we really are, where we come from, and why we're all One: Consciousness, Life, Earth, Universe. You are a miraculous, mystical being. You are the Cleu!</description>

The BUEC, as we're called, is an up-and-coming vegan community. We invite interested vegetarian-to-vegan persons who are into exploring communal and community living.

BUEC is currently looking for acreage in the states of Maine, Vermont, and North Carolina.

Various websites on which BUEC is featured include GreenPeople, Intentional Communities, Idealist.org, VegHaven, RainbowCircle, and others.

Briefly, BUEC debunks animal consumption, including that of sentient plants; teaches personal development through veganism; and empowers plant- and animal-rights activism. BUEC intends to become a vegan commune that lives by Good Samaritanship and comports itself with our neighboring communities as a Good Samaritan Commune-ity and E Center that does not discriminate.

We will need people with building, repair, computing, farming  and animal husbandry/veterinary, community liason, and other skills. BUEC intends to build and maintain an animal sanctuary and a healing center on its property, and to build or maintain small condo-style units or apartments, some homes, and other innovative living quarters.

Earth Oriented (Pagan) and all inclusive, we are looking for a few individuals who want to be close to things but have a National Forest as your backyard, which we now have accomplished (Pisgah National Forest).  Our goal was for more land, and when this land is paid in full within the next two years the idea is to purchase more land that backs up to our property.  
Friends have helped to build a small structure I call the Jed Clampett Cabin in the Woods.  It has enough space now for 1 person and the dogs- i.e. Me.  So building extra tiny is the key right now.  Would like to build common kitchen and meeting structures, which I envision small, tiny structures. Would like to build a number of 12X12 size buildings to do what needs to be done, (sleep, eat, and go to bathroom) and spend as much time as possible outside.  Permaculture techniques will be learned and used.  Organic gardening and composting a must.  Self Reliant living OFF GRID and intentional living.  This will require work and is not a free ride arrangement to bang your drums, even though we do that once in a while ourselves, meaning all carry the weight of work, not just some.  Welcome thoughts and for more details contact us.</description>

MorningSun is a small and growing community and education center that supports people to discover and unfold their potential for effective and healing action in the world. It seeks to provide a unique learning environment based on sustainable living and a daily practice of mindfulness.

We are developing both the education center and our resident community in a deeply interconnected way. Togetherness, careful loving communication, and willingness to grow through shared mindfulness practice generate a fertile soil in which our programs are growing. Programs focus on developing health, well-being, and sustainability in individuals, families, society, and the environment. They blend focused learning with service work, traditional crafts, and work on the land, and all include a training in mindfulness that supports caring human interaction and helps participants learn to respond to situations of suffering with skill, clarity, and peace.  

MorningSun's programs are being developed for adults, families, youth, and children.

Please visit the website and/or contact us for more information. We welcome inquiries and can accommodate visitors at several times each year.

MorningSun is a project of the Mindful Living Initiative (MLI), a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization that provides education and training for individuals and groups to engage in mindfulness practice and skills of sustainable living in relation to social, economic, and ecological situations.

We regard ourselves as &quot;rooted in the Christian heritage, open to the wider future,&quot; and welcome people of all faiths and none. Othona West Dorset has a sister community in Essex, together we have a network-style community with hundreds of members. Membership is available to anybody paying a small annual subscription. Many visiting Othona members return regularly over years or even decades.

A small resident core of 6 - 8 live on site, providing hospitality so that up to 35 others (at any one time) can visit for short periods to enjoy an experience of living in community together. We run a programme of workshop weekends, family holidays, retreats etc, which are open to members and non-members of Othona alike. There is a strong volunteer ethic within Othona, so many of our events are facilitated out of love or for a very modest fee. We aim to keep our visitor prices modest.

Community House and its surrounding outbuildings are on seven acres of grounds overlooking the sea, which is a ten-minute walk away through woods and fields. We have an art and craft studio with facilities for pottery, spinning and weaving, painting and games. Our library is very well stocked in the fields of spirituality and progressive theology. This is a relaxing and creative place to be, with an informal and accepting ethos.

Food is plentiful and almost entirely home-cooked, and visitors can help in food preparation. Everyone lends a hand with some simple community jobs each day.

We meet once or twice a day in a beautiful house chapel for worship and spiritual practice, which can take many forms. As an open ecumenical Christian community, we draw on many traditions, including the wisdom of all faiths.

If you are interested in joining the community as a residential member, please look on our website for current vacancies.

Polestar creates dynamic opportunities for life-long learning and spiritual growth based on the universal teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda.

Our Values:
    Our essential purpose is “the deepening of the spirit”.
    We seek to create a culture that values spirit, community and life-long learning.
    We strive to express the universal teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda and other great spiritual traditions.
    We aspire to celebrate the sacredness of life in the company of dear friends.
    We promote tolerance, compassion and service to others as a pathway to individual and world peace.
    We understand that life is a sacred opportunity to grow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/polestar-gardens-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/polestar-gardens-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Polestar is an intentional, spiritual community on the Big Island of Hawaii.
 
We offer year-round, hands-on experience in cooperative living (through a work exchange program) based on the universal teachings of Paramhansa Yogananda, author of the spiritual classic, &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;. We also offer opportunities for personal retreat and vacation, as well as many dynamic programs for families and youths. 

Our core values are spirit, community and life-long learning.

As we often say, we try to &quot;eat, meditate, work and play&quot; together. We have found these elements to be the fundamental glue that sustains our community.

We strive to &quot;keep the main thing, the main thing&quot;. That is to say, to keep our focus on spirit - maintaining our connection to our deeper Selves - at the center of our lives.

We are vegetarian, with a recreational drug and alcohol-free lifestyle, (this is a non-negotiable policy). Among various educational and inspirational programs, we offer internship and work trade programs for those who are interested in raja yoga, building, organic gardening, sacred music, art &amp;amp; creativity, alternative healing, and many other skills for living. We are on 20 beautiful acres on the Big Island of Hawaii with deep soil and a year-round growing season.

We aspire to Yogananda's ideal of simple living and high thinking and see meditation and service as our path to living fulfilled lives. We invite those who share these values to join us in creating a community that supports continuous physical, mental, and spiritual development. 

You can find more information about us on our website. Also, you can check out the link below to our Apprenticeship Application.

Bhrugu Aranya Ecovillage is a blossoming international Ecovillage, an organic Homa farm community in the rolling hills of southern Poland, with the majestic Tatra Mountains looming over the horizon. We have a spiritual focus, but are non-denominational, focusing on living in harmony with Nature.The place is magical; the energies here are quite powerful and the place heals you.

Our ecological/educational nonprofit Foundation teaches Agnihotra and Homa Therapy free of charge. We also offer additional experiential workshops in Homa Organic gardening, Fire &amp;amp; Sound Healing, Creative Arts, and Herbal Lore.

On the farm one can buy Agnihotra pyramids &amp;amp; accessories, books, our Deva herb teas, our Healing Essences, Homa organic honey. 

We also support Rose Circles, a women's empowerment program in India which helps train women below the poverty level to grow organic foods and learn skills to help them become self-sufficient. We promote their handmade products: original designed clothing, yoga mats, handmade patchwork quilts, rose brooches, etc. www.rosecircles.com 

We welcome visitors and have accommodation for guests in the log cabin and caravans.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22043&quot;&gt;Adelphi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To develop and live the beginning of a culture which includes the best of current civilization plus improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/adelphi/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/adelphi/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Adelphi is an intentional community founded by the author of the book &quot;The Ultimate Frontier.&quot; It is a place for those people interested in the philosophy presented in that book to live and interact with others of like mind. The book gives an intelligent explanation of the mysteries of human existence, and provides a practical approach to spiritual growth. Many readers said it tied together the many pieces of their own philosophy they had already learned through living. The book's philosophy is centered on the idea that the purpose of life is personal growth in psychological and emotional maturity. The pursuit of ever-greater maturity is a continuous challenge with great rewards, and it is the ultimate frontier.
Learning about the community and becoming a member and resident begins with reading &quot;The Ultimate Frontier.&quot; Adelphi is a place where conscious, deliberate effort to achieve ever-greater maturity is our purpose, and members work to create a culture that supports that goal. Come live, learn, and grow with us.

Camphill California is part of the International Camphill Movement, a worldwide initiative for social change with over a hundred affiliates worldwide, founded by Karl König and inspired by the anthroposophical teachings of Rudolf Steiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/camphill-communities-california/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/camphill-communities-california/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Camphill Communities California is a life-sharing community for adults with developmental disabilities located near Santa Cruz, California. Our vision of community living involves relationships of mutual respect, ongoing education, meaningful work, and natural circles of support.

Residents of Camphill California are dedicated organic, biodynamic gardeners. During our long growing season, we produce more than one third of the fruits and vegetables that we consume from over seven acres of carefully tended land, including a small vineyard donated by Bonny Doon.

In addition to gardening, residents work in our weaving studio, crafting a variety of hand-woven items. Our culinary workshop is also a favorite workplace and produces products including  soothing herb tea and delicious culinary mixes.  Some Camphill residents even participate in supported employment programs.</description>

“Komaja” means “radiant love.” It describes a spiritual-philosophical system, as well as an international spiritual community, founded in 1978 by the well-known tantric master Aba Aziz Makaja. Komaja offers a deep and nondogmatic access to spirituality with a complete system of spiritual schooling.

Komaja is a specific form of tantric kundalini yoga, developed by Makaja who, as spiritual master, is at the core of Komaja’s life and its development. Knowledge is Komaja’s connecting spiritual thread, radiant love its principal virtue. The seven main activities of the community are meditation, theoretical studies, development of community consciousness, karma yoga, spiritualization of sexuality (via asceticism or by being sexually active; original methods of realization are given for both paths), spiritual singing, and spiritual sport.

Today Komaja has more than 300 members and many friends who draw inspiration from its model of living. They live all over Europe, Australia, and in North America. Makaja and his community are socially involved in many countries, with humanitarian and ecological activities, scientific and educational/therapeutical activities, etc. Komaja is member of the World Association for Sexology; Komaja’s Love-Erotic Therapy (LET), for overcoming different kinds of addictions, is privately and state financed. Komaja is an example of how new forms of intimate relationships can be lived successfully: many people practice the zajedna, an original form of polyamory.

We are a forming community. We intend to grow much of the food we'll enjoy, to work cooperatively, and make decisions by consensus.

We currently meet online using Yahoo IM. Contact Dan for more information. 

We'll honor the essence of religion by providing a place where we'll share each other's paths. 

We will provide for ourselves through community projects, such as creating retreat space, growing herbal and medicinal plants for marketing or other onsite or mail order enterprises. These would not preclude individual cottage industries or smaller group projects or programs that would enhance the viability of our community.

We will explore right livelihood, and peaceful existence, and reach out to the greater community and world to provide what we can to help others in whatever way we come to feel meets the community's ability and desires.

      <name>700th Millennium Community (formerly 7th Millennium Community)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22079&quot;&gt;700th Millennium Community (formerly 7th Millennium Community)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To establish the self-reliant, self-sufficient, self-sustainable communes, cooperatives &amp;amp; ecological villages in the logistic, safe &amp;amp; strategic environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/7th-millennium-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/7th-millennium-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
     The 700th (formerly 7th) Millennium Community is the proposed self-reliant, self-sufficient, self-sustainable cooperative composed of a Christian or Messianic camp, beach resort, conference &amp;amp; retreat center, retirement complex, kibbutz, guided tour, with some cottage industries, enterprises, &amp;amp; general consulting services.  The Christians, Messianic, other believers &amp;amp; followers ought to be the creators of jobs &amp;amp; suppliers of the goods &amp;amp; services, rather than mere employees &amp;amp;  consumers.  They ought to be working for the Creator, Elohim, YHVH &amp;amp;/or Christ rather than for the cartel or monopolistic groups, credit, market, material-oriented &amp;amp; for the &quot;front&quot; churches, clubs, companies, establishments, industries, institutions, missions, NGOs, societies, &amp;amp; others.

     First, we are going back to the earliest Messianic era by emulating most of the living &amp;amp; working practices of the original New Testament Church (Acts 2:44-45; 4:32-35).

     Second, we are going to emulate the excellent examples on the self-sustainable communes, communities of the Mennonites, Hutterian Brethren, Amish, Bruderhof, Noiva do Cordeiro, 12 Tribes Community, &amp;amp; few other intentional communities that are religious, secular, ecological, &amp;amp; sustainable villages.  We are also hoping to follow the successful kibbutzim in Israel.

     Third, we are striving to live our daily lives in preparation for our Messiah’s second coming or Utopia whether it occurs in the next 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 years, or beyond!  
 
     Conceived as the ideal solutions to the problems of the Sabbath-observing, Christians, Messianic, other believers &amp;amp; followers, we in the 700th Millennium Community will pursue the establishment of the self-reliant, self-sufficient or sustainable cooperative so as to provide an alternative homeland to live in for safety, security, ideal retirement living.  To create job opportunities for our fellow &amp;amp; would-be Christians, Messianic, other  leaders &amp;amp; followers:  students, graduates, underemployed &amp;amp; unemployed persons who are interested to search for, to know &amp;amp; understand the general truths, &amp;amp; apply them in their lives.  To seek associations, fellowships, &amp;amp; partnerships with similar intentional communities in other countries, &amp;amp; be their mission, outreach partners in the Philippines according to His will.  The proposed sites would be somewhere in Southern Leyte &amp;amp; other provinces in the Philippines, or when our Creator or Provider opens the doors.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Links:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Alternative, Renewable Fuels and Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;:
You have been deceived by the oil cartels!  The alternative &amp;amp; renewable fuels are available since 200 years ago!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Wanted:  Hovercraft &amp;amp; other Modern Transportation&lt;/a&gt;:
Why we need the passenger hovercraft &amp;amp; other unique transportation in the Philippines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;IDL = a Mark of the Beast&lt;/a&gt;:
The Christians working &amp;amp; living between west of the International Date Line &amp;amp; east of the Garden of Eden/Jerusalem/Israel longitudinal line have been observing the wrong weekly and yearly Sabbaths for 6 millennia!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Armageddon, Great Tribulation, Wormwood:  How to Survive&lt;/a&gt;:  We are now living through the major signs of the times.  Who, why, what to do, where, when &amp;amp; how to establish or join other preppers for the endtimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Kingdom of Elohim on Earth&lt;/a&gt;: The original New Testament Church applied the self-sustainable lifestyle, as clearly described in Acts 2:44-45; 4:32-35, which some of the religious, secular groups &amp;amp; individuals globally have been practicing from several decades to over 4.9 centuries.  The unfortunate poor persons in the churches, congregations, assemblies, charismatic movements &amp;amp; other religious organizations need to send &quot;a note to God&quot; to ask Him so that the millionaires, billionaires, wealthy &amp;amp; blessed Christian, Messianic members &amp;amp; other worshipers would act on and apply His words.    
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;How to Build Inexpensive Homes or Shelters&lt;/a&gt;:
Millions to billions of the people have the freedom, liberty &amp;amp; option to build the inexpensive homes or shelters. They can chose to follow the self-sufficient, self-sustainable lifestyles of the original Body of Yahshua or Christ that started on the Day of Pentecost in Jerusalem about 2,000 years ago!&lt;/li&gt;

We intend to develop a truly close and deeply caring sense of community, togetherness, or empathic communion of hearts and minds, involving a substantial sense of emotional bonding, belonging, and inner connection of life energies, as a synergistic relational &quot;we,” an &quot;us.&quot; Our process of developing an optimal sense of harmonious, cohesive, community is grounded in a new understanding of optimal human relationship, interpersonal communication, and psychological growth, in which hearts, minds, and spirits are deeply connected to each other, in a state of nondualistic empathic communion, harmonious loving attunement, and co-creative synergy. We understand the process of developing open, empathic, deeply meaningful, honest, sincere, constructive, and generously giving, interpersonal communication. 


Through this process, as well as various other means, we help our members awaken to, and spontaneously express, their unique &quot;heartsong&quot;—i.e., their inherent, uniquely individual, archetypal life theme; basic natural life function; or most fulfilling life dream, vision, mission, or destiny, which provides them with an optimal sense of joyful, regenerative, life-energy flow. This relational process of psychological and spiritual growth produces holistic healings, of all kinds, as well as the enhanced actualization of one's natural real-life potentials. Relatedly, we have developed innovative programs in transformative education, arts and creative expression, mentoring, holistic healing, as well as global transformation of the collective heart of humanity. 


We are seeking new members who are predominantly relationship-oriented, and tend to be open to continued learning and growth, willing to question their own presumptions, as well as honest, warmhearted, mostly unselfish, generously giving of themselves, sincerely caring, and cooperative, rather than being habitually conflictual, willful, competitive, defensive, prideful, and selfish, in their relationship with others. Our community will serve as a model of constructive global transformation, grounded in psychological maturity, caring human relationships, as well as actualization of individual and relationship potentials, bringing optimal levels of productive functioning and well-being. 


Members are required to be financially self-supporting, and to live a wholesome, productive, lifestyle. No addictive substances or sexual promiscuity are permitted in this community.
&lt;/div&gt;

For non-members as well as members of our community, we offer spiritual/transformational life coaching and relationship counseling services. We can teach you how to be intuitively guided by your own soul, and to connect to what is genuine in yourself, other individuals, and the spiritual reality of life and love. For a sample of our insights, see our published books and articles at: https://independent.academia.edu/BarryHammer If interested, contact us at email: mhbj58@gmail.com</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22118&quot;&gt;Rose Creek Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Follow Christ by his Spirit and love one another as He loves us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/rose-creek-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/rose-creek-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Rose Creek Village, nestled among the rolling, wooded hills of west Tennessee, is home to an astonishing experiment in corporate living, with breathtaking results.

Can Americans get along? Can they give up their private dreams and goals and live for others? It was the claim of Jesus Christ that those who embrace his teachings, his Gospel, and his Life would be recognized by their enthusiastic love and togetherness. “Everyone will know you are my disciples by your love for one another,” he said.

Twenty five years ago a few men wondered if these things were true, and they gave themselves to God to find out. Many things have changed over those years. Many more men, women, and children have joined them, some have gone away, and we have had to learn both our weaknesses and God’s provision. We are still changing and learning, but we can now say unequivocally that the claims Jesus Christ made 2,000 years ago are true even in 21st century America.

We invite you to come and see the work God has done. We have found his Life to be a joyful one. We have learned that people are made to live as friends, caring for and serving one another. We have learned that children raised in such an environment are free, creative, daring, reliable, and filled with joy. While America has seen its share of communes filled with loose living and bizarre cults created by controlling religious fanatics, we have been told repeatedly that one look at our children at play is enough to prove this is not so at Rose Creek Village.

“And they steadfastly continued in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship and in breaking of bread and prayers. Every soul felt a sense of awe…all the believers were together, and they had everything in common… They broke bread from house to house, and they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with everyone.”

It is this beautiful picture that first captivated our hearts. We have had the delight to see it come into reality in our daily lives. Though we are human and we face the same struggles that others face, none of us ever struggles alone. The grace of God is very real to us, and the harmony we experience is only because of his presence among us.

You can learn more about us at our website. We are not extraordinary people—we are very real, ordinary people who had nothing good to offer God, but who have been carried along by him into this amazing life we call Rose Creek Village.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22138&quot;&gt;Dolphin Community - Black Forst Network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; helping others finding God&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/dolphin-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/dolphin-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
In Native American mythology, the dolphin represents the combination of heaven and Earth, spirituality and matter, vision and realization. We are already living communally in this sense, in a small communal home and others living within 10 kilometers. In our spiritual diversity, communal singing, eating, hiking, baby-sitting, decision making by consensus, and solving conflicts, we are learning from the experiences of older communities and are passing on our own experiences through the Ökodorf-Institute: consultations, festivals, a mail-order business, and seminars on searching for and founding communities. Regarding service to fellow human beings, at the moment we are supporting the establishment of free schools in Africa. We are friends with several dozen local residents and are in friendly contact with others. South Black Forest considers itself something of a melting pot, since southern and eastern Europeans have been working in the textile industry here for over 150 years. In the long run, we would like to establish a spiritual-ecological village in addition to being integrated into the existing village and region. This new village will probably be close by and will make it easier to become self-sufficient. We would like to build the village together with a regional network of friends of our community. As a first step in this direction, we have established a local labor-exchange system (Wiesentaler instead of Euro), and we will use the Artabana health community instead of health insurance.

We trust that God/inner voice will guide us in deciding what to do next, just as we have been guided so well since 1995. People interested in joining should first send us a page about themselves and their vision. We will then send more information about ourselves as well.

In 2009 we have been searching to buy a farm in Germany or near it with some hectares to plant our own vegetables, etc. We also want to grow our community in such a way that we can help old, dying members to die in a good way, inside our community.

Bread and Roses is a Christian-based community living in a rented 18-room building and two adjacent appartments in Hamburg, Germany. We live together, share our house with homeless refugees and migrants, and share income and a lot of other resources. We are inspired by the Catholic Worker movement, other houses of hospitality, and Christian communities in the United States, Latin America and Europe. We have daily morning prayer and an occasional public worship and try to spread our social vision by inviting people to our house and by social actions for marginalized people. We are pacifists and try to live simply to protect the environment. Although presently we live in the city, a sister community in the countryside would be wonderful.

Vallersund Farm is a small Camphill village located on the coast of Trøndelag. It is a village out of the ordinary that offers care to people with special needs.

The ‘Fram-school’ is also located here, which is an educational service for young adults with learning disabilities.

We have organic farming and gardening, sheltered workshops and teaching.

The intentional community of Vallersund is also an Eco-village with an interest in alternative energy. We have a windmill that covers our energy needs. A heat pump extracts energy from the sea which heats our houses. A biological purifying plant treats the waste-water before it is returned to the sea.

Vallersund Gård was once a bustling trading post that today is part of the national protection-plan for old buildings.

Raw fruitarian diet is a goal, getting off of the 'grid' in every way (financially, power-wise, idea-wise) is all part of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/paradise-gardens/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/paradise-gardens/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Hey! We're still here ('Earth Day' 'April 22, 2018')! Feel free to email us but do NOT send form mail! All form mails will get no response.

NOTE!!! : People have been contacting us for YEARS after NOT having read our website. Read !! :

1. WE HAVE NO LAND (YET!) OR PLACE FOR YOU TO STAY. A primary motivating purpose of this Project is to GATHER TOGETHER those who CANNOT AFFORD to buy land title, etc. and POOL our resources in order to buy that land title etc.!

2. We want self-starting people who see that it is ALL OF US who MUST make this Project happen rather than relying on someone else to build it. 

&quot;Once upon a time there were four people: Their names were Everybody, Somebody, Nobody, and Anybody. Whenever there was an important job to do Everybody was sure that Somebody would do it. Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it. When Nobody did it, Everybody got angry because it was Everybody’s job. Everybody thought Somebody would do it, but Nobody realized that Nobody would do it. So consequently Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody could have done in the first place.&quot;

If you are still interested after reading the above, continue on to our Basic Description below! :

-------------------------

 The purpose of the Paradise Restoration Project is to create Paradise Gardens sanctuaries worldwide.

'Paradise' means 'garden sanctuary' (from the Persian word 'pairidaeza', pairi meaning 'park' or garden, 'daeza' meaning 'enclosed' or 'sanctuary').

Raw fruitarian (killing and injury-free) diet as the ideal, sharing 'ownership' (shared land title) regardless of finances, independence from the need for 'money' (meaning being truly 'off the grid' in EVERY way), co-helping the poor, disabled, discouraged, misunderstood, misfit, outcast, creative peaceful and loving people to pool financial and all other resources in order to obtain land title and other necessities of living in paradisial gardens. 

Decision making by 100% consensus council, 'extended family' values, love and co-operation, co-creative endeavours, freedom from addictions and true dedication to the greater good of the whole are central precepts.

Religious / spiritual values include all those that are conducive to the simple living basics of life in paradise
or Paradisianism. Paradisian/Ebionite/Essene/Nazorean/Os

Haidakandi Love is a center inspired by Baba JI where the primary focus is on faith, great cosmic energy (God), and spiritual and emotional work on oneself. Fundamental is the discovery of the void within, and devotion becomes the instrument that fills this void. The fire of devotion creates union between the people in their diversity. We work with energy, teach Reiki, and work on various aspects of the person--physical, emotional, and spiritual. Healing and devotion form the basis of the center. All the cultures of the Earth are invited to offer their teachings. We are preparing to be self-sufficient in electricity, water, and fruit and vegetables. We hope to have another family living and working with us in the near future to create total self-sufficiency.

Hummingbird Community is located on 500 acres of lush land nestled against the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of northern New Mexico. We began as a non-local community within Global Family bonding through our extensive international peace and educational work. Global Family, founded in 1986, is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization affiliated with the United Nations whose purpose is to support a shift in consciousness from separation and fear to unity, love, and cooperation.

As social pioneers, we share a commitment to the principles and practices of co-creation. Since founding Hummingbird in 1996, we have grown into a diverse group of 22 deeply connected core members who support one another in fulfilling each of our souls’ purpose.

Hummingbird Community is one of four primary aspects of our overarching organization, the Hummingbird Center for a Co-Creative World (www.hummingbirdcenterforacocreativeworld.com):
- Global Family
An international network of individuals and groups who choose to experience themselves as members of one human family and who desire to actualize their life purpose through joining with others in compassionate action for the benefit of all.
- Hummingbird Community
As social pioneers, our Community is dedicated to the practices and principles of co-creation in service to the evolution of consciousness. We honor diverse spiritual traditions, and are committed to personal and planetary transformation. 
- Hummingbird Living School
The educational programs of HBLS are designed to give people the understanding, information and skills necessary to be a leader in the pioneering adventure of bringing forth a profoundly healthy and loving world.
- Hummingbird WellNest
A premier wellness center for those who desire a renewed sense of wellbeing and balance. We value personal relationships, emotions, beliefs, meanings and the connections these have to the body, mind, spirit and all of humanity. 

We invite others to join us in our living laboratory of discovery where Source and Nature guide us to co-create a new world.

Light of Freedom is located near the beautiful Blue Ridge Parkway in southern Virginia. It is a place for inner peace, and dedicated to healing through relationships. In Oneness, we see our equality. Everyone has their own chosen work and interests including horticulture, healing arts, crafts,architecture, aquaculture, and writing, on land owned by the community. 

Light of Freedom is developing the “Caregivers Society” an organization that brings caregivers together for education, training, support group, and placement.  We are creating a Caregiver List of qualified caregivers for the community to draw upon.  We recognize that everyone is a caregiver in some form.  We also recognize that non of us have been trained for this job.  Our purpose is to fill that void.  For more information you can contact.

Some individuals live in the community house and others build their own sustainable homestead. Alternative building methods are strongly encouraged. We prefer to catch and use the sun, wind, water, and earth given us, returning them naturally to the life cycle with zero pollution. Our first house produces its own electric power from the sun and wind, was built from sawmill poplar, and has an earth roof which demonstrates a sustainable life style. We maintain our quiet enjoyment of organic gardening, ponds, and orchard with future.

We give workshops and classes on “A Course in Miracles,” alternative building methods, and renewable energy systems. We meet as a community monthly where decisions are made by 100 % consensus. Meetings begin with our acknowledgment of peace as our one goal, and in peace, understanding comes, allowing us to perceive solutions to community problems. We recognize we share one spirit and one life, and all decisions are given to Spirit for guidance, directions, and resolution. We want to build a council center, and welcome any help in that direction.  

For our community, living by the &quot;golden rule&quot; is to perceive in others what you would have them perceive in you. Our vision at Light of Freedom is, and will be, a happy gathering of equals. We welcome visitors; call or write for directions and availability of accommodations.

We deepen our spiritual path through direct experience and eat, dance, and pray together. The community, begun in June 1995, is a retreat center, a nature preserve, and a residential village on 1,500 acres along year-round Bear Creek.  We host group and individual retreats with inclusive spiritual themes.

People interested in residency at the Southwest Sufi Community want to have the pioneer spirit, be financially self-sufficient or resourceful, and in good health. Since the land is remote from town, it is not practical to commute. People will need to support themselves in creative ways. Those interested in establishing cottage industries on the land are especially encouraged to come and check us out.

The best way to get to know the community is to come for a visit, or attend one of our camps or retreats We offer limited indoor accommodations, camping, vegetarian meals, classes, and time in nature. We welcome visitors at other times, too, especially on weekends. Please write or email before planning a visit and tell us you saw this listing in the Communities Directory.

A river flows through this beautiful location, which features a network of trails and scenic overlooks. With a friendly staff to help guests enjoy their stay, we offer a rare opportunity for visitors to experience spiritual rest and relaxation in a supportive and nourishing environment.

There are about 25 of us- Artists, students, working professionals and retired people- who have come together to enjoy simple, comfortable living at a reasonable cost. Preference is given to Friends and those people involved in socially responsible concerns, as we support people who are dedicated to making valuable contributions toward world peace, our planet and each other.The Penington’s ample common space and shared meals provide a wonderful opportunity to get to know a wide range of people. Our dinners are simple, but delicious. Our chefs purchase many organic or locally grown ingredients and provide both vegetarian and non-vegetarian entrees.  
   Everyone shares in the housework, which consists of housekeeping details, dining room chores and bathroom cleaning.  Participation in these duties is an integral part of PFH and vital to both its physical existence and spiritual core of sharing, service, and community life.  Residents are asked to participate on various committees for decision making within the house and to make every effort to attend dinner together.   It cannot be emphasized too strongly that residency at PFH depends upon a healthy, responsible attitude of cooperation and contribution.
     We also have 2 overnight guest rooms for Friends traveling through the city.  These can be rented for up to 2 weeks.  guest room reservation information can be found on our website.</description>

Sunrise Ranch is one of the longest-standing Intentional Communities in the USA. Founded in 1945, and located about 10 miles west of Loveland, Colorado, Sunrise Ranch has 70-80 multi-generational residents living and working together on 360 acres in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. 

The community has weekly worship services, an elected governing board, regular community meetings, internship and visitor programs and a retreat and conference business handling groups up to 200. We also run a farm, growing organic vegetables both in our gardens and green houses, along with  raising grass-fed beef.

Sunrise Ranch honors Universal Being in all its forms—through people, through nature and through all creation. We see this attitude of honor for Universal Being as the pivotal factor for the future of humanity.

Most of all, we honor and welcome the expression of Universal Being through ourselves. We believe that this orientation in living is what opens the door for a full knowing of the wisdom and love that is within everyone. It is what lets the individual give their greatest gift to the world and know the greatest fulfillment that is possible for a human being.

All of Sunrise Ranch is dedicated as a teaching and demonstration site for this essential wisdom—both the inner knowing of Universal Being and the practical application of that knowing. This is why we practice and teach sustainable agriculture and farm-to-table food preparation. This is what is behind all the workshops, conferences, concerts and courses that we offer. This is what we teach in our internship programs and in all our courses for spiritual awakening and personal development. Sunrise Ranch exists to embody this truth and to bring it to the world.

We believe that Universal Being is doing its best to incarnate and express fully through each person, not as a separate reality but as the core reality of who they are. And when it does, that person becomes whole and creates wholeness in their world. They bring healing to the land, to other people and to the planet. Whole people—whole world.

This is what allows our individual worlds to thrive. This is why Sunrise Ranch is flourishing. And it is the experience of this simple, profound truth that will let Planet Earth become the garden home that it is destined to become.

To us, this is not just a nice idea, but a guiding principle to be embodied in everything we do. If you agree, we welcome you to join with us in bringing this experience to the world.

      <name>American Buddhist Shim Gum Do Association</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22268&quot;&gt;American Buddhist Shim Gum Do Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; American Buddhist Shim Gum Do Association is the American branch of World Shim Gum Do Association.  World Shim Gum Do also has branches in Italy, South Korea and Poland. The center of all Shim Gum Do is the Shim Gwang Sa - Mind Light Temple.  Shim Gwang Sa is dedicated to preserving and maintaining all aspects of the original Zen Buddhist art of Shim Gum Do, (the Mind Sword Path) and the teachings of Shim Gum Do Founding Master Great Zen Master Chang Sik Kim.
Shim Gum Do is an original Zen Art that integrates the practice and principles of Zen Buddhist meditation with the “action meditation” of martial art practice. Shim Gum Do has six parts which comprise about 1,000 “forms.” A form is a choreographed sequence of martial art techniques of blocking and attacking movements. Each form is unique and generates a specific energy and artful expression. The six parts of Shim Gum Do are Zen Sword, Shin Boep, Ho Shin Sul, Long Stick, Two Sword and Short Stick. Zen Sword consists of forms that utilize a single-edged sword; Shin Boep or “Body Dharma” is similar to karate in that it is a weaponless art of hand and foot movements; Ho Shin Sul, or self-defense, is a system of grappling techniques for breaking grabs, joint locks, throws and pressure points; Long Stick consists of forms that use a long straight, pole-like stick; Two Sword forms use two swords; and Short Stick forms use a short, arm-length, straight stick.
Shim Gwang Sa Temple has ongoing classes in Shim Gum Do. Shim Gum Do Founding Master Great Zen Master Chang Sik Kim teaches monthly meditation sessions and Dharma Talks that are free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/american-buddhist-shim-gum-do-association/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/american-buddhist-shim-gum-do-association/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Shim Gwang Sa (Mind Light Temple) is the main teaching center of the American Buddhist Shim Gum Do Association and the World Shim Gum Do Association. Shim Gwang Sa teaches the Zen Buddhist martial art called Shim Gum Do (&quot;Mind Sword Path&quot;). Shim Gum Do Founding Master Dae Soen Sa Nim (Great Zen Master) Chang Sik Kim is the 79th patriarch of his Dharma lineage that began with Shakyamuni Buddha. Zen Master Kim began his formal Zen training under Dae Soen Sa Nim Seung Sahn, Abbot of the Hwa Gye Temple of the Chyoge order of Zen Buddhism in Seoul, Korea, at the age of thirteen. When he was twenty one, Zen Master Kim underwent a 100-day retreat on Sam Gak mountain. During this time, Shim Gum Do was revealed to Zen Master Kim through his meditation and he attained enlightenment.
Shim Gum Do is a Zen practice that brings together the mind and body through dynamic practice of action meditation through the martial art forms of Shim Gum Do combined with sitting meditation. The practice of Shim Gum Do emphasizes attaining a clear mind, clear thinking, and clear action. Shim Gwang Sa has ongoing classes in Shim Gum Do and offers a residential training program. The residential program is for those who are interested in a more intensive study of Shim Gum Do and traditional Zen temple practices.</description>

Its members of all ages currently live in large multifamily homes and apartment buildings in Evanston and the Rogers Park neighborhood of northern Chicago.  

Reba’s calling is “to extend the mission of Jesus by being a community of love and discipleship, and by nurturing other such communities as God gives us grace.” Practically, this has meant sharing resources and needs through a common treasury, living within walking distance of each other, developing and maintaining affordable housing, sponsoring a Monday night potluck and seminar for students and neighbors, welcoming visitors, and supporting the healthy growth of new Christian communities. Fellowship members work in shared ministries and in “outside” earning jobs, mostly in the service professions.

Growing relationships with local universities, an expanding intern program, and an influx of younger members are renewing Reba’s vision and forming leaders for the next generation of Christian community.</description>

To provide an education in the Buddha's teachings to interested students.
To provide the facilities for the study and practice of the Buddha's teachings.
To engage in activities that help preserve the Buddha's teachings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/tibetan-buddhist-learning-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/tibetan-buddhist-learning-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
The Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center (TBLC), Labsum Shedrub Ling, was founded through the great efforts of Geshe Wangyal, a Kalmyk-Mongolian lama who received his Buddhist training in Kalmykia and in Tibet. The center was founded in 1958. Over the years, Geshe-la took on Western students who had developed an interest in learning about Tibetan Buddhism. Before Geshe-la passed away on January 30, 1983, he appointed Joshua W.C. Cutler as director of the activities of the center. In the following year, His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet, always revered by Geshe-la as the spiritual head of the center, advised that the English name be changed to the Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center to clearly reflect that its main activity is teaching Tibetan Buddhism.

In summer, fall, and spring, TBLC gives weekend seminars intended as intensive instructions on specific topics for beginners and advanced students alike. Our primary aim is to develop a Buddhism that is culturally American and, at its heart, not different from the Buddhism that traveled from India through Tibet to TBLC's Tibetan monk, scholars and students in the United States.

TBLC also has a limited number of resident students who study Tibetan language and Buddhist philosophy for extended periods of time. Living in this Buddhist contemplative community gives them a unique opportunity to apply the Buddhist teachings in a practical way.

The Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center holds a Monthly prayer and meditation session every first Sunday of every month from 11 AM-12:30 PM in the main temple followed by a class in the School House from 2-3:30 PM on the first Sunday of the month. This class is LIVESTREAMING. Check website for info: www.labsum.org.

Every Saturday from 10:30 AM-noon we have a class with our Resident monk-scholar, Geshe Lobsang Sopa, who is visiting for 2 years from Ganden Shartse Monastery in India to study the English Language and give classes in Buddhist Philosophy.

We have a Prayer and Meditation Session on the first Sunday of every Month in our Main Temple. Followed by a Class from 1:30-3 pm in the School House on Buddhist Philosophy given by our Teacher, the Venerable Geshe Yeshe Thabkhe, Professor Emeritus of the Central University of Tibetan Studies in Sarnath India during July through November. We also have classes given by the Resident American Teachers and Co-Directors: Joshua &amp; Diana Cutler. The Classes on the monthly Sundays are Livestreamed, so check out the website: www.labsum.org for how to link up.

On Tuesday and Thursday Evenings there are SKYPE Classes with Joshua &amp; Diana Cutler.
For more information, email: info@labsum.org to sign up and get the reading assignments.

In March, we have the Annual Founder’s Day. 
In August, we have the Annual Maitreya Festival, as well as Weekend Learning Intensives.

All these are Listed on the Events Page.

The Findhorn Foundation is a spiritual community, ecovillage and an international centre for holistic learning, founded in 1962 in Morayshire, northeast Scotland. We run experiential workshops and events that offer profound and practical steps for personal and global transformation.  Our work is based on the values of:
•	connecting to your own inner wisdom
•	co-creating with the intelligence of nature
•	service to the world

Our aim is to actively create a positive and sustainable future for humanity and the planet. We recognise that achieving this aim can only be accomplished within the context of a new consciousness and changed worldview. We have no formal creed or doctrine, and honour all the world's major religions as paths to inner wisdom. 

The Findhorn Foundation and community offers many ways to visit, live, and work together. We present a range of leading edge events and workshops for residential guests every year, and welcome day visitors. More than 400 people live within or are locally connected to our community.

Findhorn Experience Weeks began in 1974 and provide a powerful, often heart-opening, introduction to our spiritual principles and their application in daily life, and have been attended by more than 30,000 people so far. 

The development of our ecovillage is a continuation of our work with nature and is a tangible demonstration of the links between the environment and the social, economic, and spiritual aspects of life. It is a constantly evolving model. 

The Findhorn Foundation is a founding member of Global Ecovillage Network and is a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) associated with the UN Department of Public Information. We work in partnership with Highlands and Islands Enterprise/Moray, Moray Council, universities, healthcare providers and others.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22298&quot;&gt;The Farm Community in Summertown, Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Sustainable Living, Spirituality &amp; Social Change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Farm is an intentional community of families and friends living on 1,750 acres in south-central Tennessee. Since its inception in 1971, the purpose of The Farm community has been to provide a secure, ecologically healthy, commonly held land base for its members and succeeding generations. It is a place where we can relate to each other and the natural environment in a sustainable way, draw upon the collective strength of the community, and contribute to the positive transformation of the world.

The Farm is a spiritual community but follows no specific doctrine. Founded on the principles of nonviolence and respect for the earth, there is general agreement that all world religions share essential truths that are the moral guideposts for sanity and happiness.

Over its 40+ year history, The Farm community has established numerous nonprofit organizations as part of its mission to create positive change in the world. These include Plenty International (international relief and development), Kids To the Country (brings at-risk children to The Farm), The Ecovillage Training Center (sustainability education), Swan Conservation Trust (1425-acre nature preserve), PeaceRoots Alliance (global peace movement), and More Than Warmth (students creating peace quilts sent to children around the world), and many more. The Farm is probably best known for its midwifery program in which the sacrament of birth is considered as an inherent right of all women, newborns, and families. Both basic and advanced midwifery workshops take place throughout the year.

Approximately 200 residents and over 20 Farm businesses contribute to the maintenance and operation of the community. The community is managed by an elected board of directors along with a variety of committees staffed by volunteers. The Farm Education/Conference Center hosts conferences and is the umbrella organization for the Farm School, which offers alternative education to both resident and neighboring school-age students. GreenLife Retreats is the host of The Farm Experience Weekend and a variety of other events and activities that give visitors a more in depth way to learn about community life.

Founded in Copake, New York in 1961, Camphill Village USA is the oldest and largest Camphill community in North America and sits on 615 acres of verdant hills, pastures, and beautiful gardens in southern Columbia County. Camphill Village is part of the international Camphill Movement, which is based on the insights of anthroposophy, the philosophy, world view, and spiritual path of Rudolf Steiner Ph.D. Life at Camphill Village is based on the active affirmation of the dignity, spiritual integrity, and valued contribution of each individual.</description>

Camphill Village Kimberton Hills is one of 10 North American communities in the Camphill movement--each one unique, yet all with similar purposes. We seek to create a renewed village life and to establish healthy social forms of human interdependence. Our approach is based on the inspirations of Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy, which allows each person to evolve to their potential as a respected individual.
Started in 1972, our 432-acre agricultural and crafts community is run by 90 members, including some with developmental disabilities (autism, Down's syndrome, fragile X, and others). We have 12 houses that shelter &quot;extended families&quot; who work in the dairy, CSA garden, herb garden, orchard, bakery, fiber workshop, music workshop, pottery, and cafe. We have a strong cultural life that integrates art and music into our lives. Volunteers are welcome to share in our life and work for a year, or perhaps a lifetime. Our community sponsors an apprenticeship program in biodynamic agriculture, and training in fabric arts.

Our school also is licensed by the Pennsylvania Departments of Education and Public Welfare and we are a Pennsylvania Approved Private School for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities. We are part of the worldwide Camphill movement and the only Camphill community in North America for children.

When founded in 1963, The Camphill School was based upon the idea that the new community not only would become a village for children, but a place that nurtured childhood itself. This was powerfully affirmed in 1967 when a foundation stone was laid at Rock Crystal, the village’s first purposely built house where volunteers, interns, and children with intellectual and developmental disabilities could share their lives.</description>

Beacon Hill Friends House is located on historic Beacon Hill in Boston, Massachusetts, a few blocks from the State House. The building was originally built in 1803.

      <name>Coweeta Heritage Center</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22321&quot;&gt;Coweeta Heritage Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; CHC's mission is to teach strategies for self-reliant living in order to reduce impacts on our environment. This is best expressed by the term Voluntary Simplicity or learning to live with less.  As I mentioned the second goal is to help heal the earth and each other.  Eventually this might include becoming a retreat center and offer programming for those interested.  The organic garden here produces lots of greens and other produce which helps provide healthy local food for our community.  The 1/5 acre garden can produce as much as 50 pounds of salad mixes, greens, onion, garlic and more weekly.  The garden is also a resource for those interested in learning to care for the earth and heal oneself through organically grown foods and working intimately with the environment. More on what it means to come here: 
Coweeta is a place of healing.  It pure spring waters, the sounds of water flowing, birds singing, clouds sailing by are music to your soul.  Coweeta is a place to get lost and found; tucked away in an intimate valley with little human activity.  It is the perfect place to rediscover who you are and your place in the natural world.  It is a place where cell phones don’t work and your watch may lose time.  It is a place to park your car and walk.  

Coweeta’s beyond organic gardens teach you to nurture yourself and the earth.  Each year tons of leaves are incorporated into the soil to feed the hordes of micro and macro organisms that feed the plants that are grown. Nourish your body and spirit with food you help grow and harvest.  

Coweeta’s gardens also help feed the local community and this is the perfect place to connect with folks and share the bounty of the earth and invite them to come to Coweeta to visit.  Coweeta is a place of sharing.

Coweeta is a place to gather your energies to do the work that nurtures your spirit and contributes to the good in the world whatever this may mean for you.  

Coweeta is a place of spirit, in the trees, rocks, animals, water and air.  Drink in the beauty and spirit here to nourish your soul.  Quiet your mind and be open to the spirit and energies of life around you.

Coweeta is also a place to engage in meaningful work.  With your hands you can help create a place of shelter, paths to walk on, beds to grow healthy food in, contributing to a welcoming community.  Yes, this takes work and some sweat and tears at times.

Coweeta is a place that will grow in you and you will grow in it.  Caring for something means that you become part of it.  This can be as simple as picking up branches that have fallen on roads or paths, building a rock wall that will last a century or more, gathering leaves for the garden each year to enrich the soil, or just sitting quietly in a spot you have chosen.  

Coweeta is a place to learn new things and apply what you learn to doing the “good work” of living simply so that others can simply live.  It is a place to learn to feed yourself from the earth.  

Coweeta is also a place of cleansing.  Of giving away habits that may keep you from living as free and healthy a life as you can.  Let the peace and quiet and companionship of the world fill your heart.  Give yourself entirely to the earth and it will fill your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/coweeta-heritage-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/coweeta-heritage-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Coweeta Heritage Center/Talking Rock Farm is a school, working farm and homestead.  Our goal at CHC is to help preserve the cultural history and natural beauty of this area. A second goal is to become a healing community for both the earth and each other.  I am looking for long term volunteers or permanent members.  Please contact me if you are  interested.  I will consider individuals as well as families. 
 
CHC are located in the Nantahalla Mountains of the eastern side of the Blue Ridge Mountains, 10 miles south of the town of Franklin, North Carolina (120 miles N.E. of Atlanta, GA and 70 miles west of Asheville, NC). The center's 32 acres lie in the heart of a small valley with a stream fed by numerous springs and surrounded by national forest. The stream provides water for our hydro-electric system. We are off-the-grid. The area is home to wild turkey, deer, bear, and has one of the largest diversities of plants anywhere in the world. Huge chestnut stumps, remains of 1800 log cabins, mill raceways, spring houses, century old farming roads, and old still sites, are reminders of a people and a way of life based on an intimate knowledge of the environment and those skills needed to survive. 

Paul is a former teacher of Industrial Arts and Technology Education and is well versed in woodworking. He is working on developing appropriate building techniques that incorporate the log construction styles of the past, as well as alternative energy systems. The center has its own saw mill to provide lumber for building projects which may eventually include cabins, a workshop, and a small conference center for retreats and programming. 

Daily life includes organic gardening, aquaculture (trout), basic building skills, wildcrafting, preserving foods, off the grid living, permaculture, crafts (wooden spoon production), saw milling, and other practical living skills for sustainable living.  I currently don't have goats but would be willing to have them again with others to help care for them.  The chickens went with my wife. I would like to have chickens again with others help.

My current goal is to invite others who would be interested in starting an intentional community.  I'm open to discussing what this might be and hearing the ideas of other interested folks.  It would be a work in progress and I am trying not to have an agenda starting out.  Temporary housing  would be needed if other wanted to join.  Permanent housing could be built as needed.  

My focus has been and will continue to be on education, growing healthy food to share with the community through our tailgate market and health food stores.  I currently work with the county summer camp program teaching wood working with kids.  It is lots of fun.  This summer I will teach with the Little Middle Folk School at John C. Campbell Folkschool.  This will be my 13th year doing this.  I also participate in heritage festivals, the Foxfire Museum, and craft shows.  I recently led a program on Humanure composting with our Eco Forum monthly at the Unitarian Fellowship in Franklin.  I have conducted tours of our property and gardens for many years.  

I have suspended our very short term volunteer program until others become involved to help with the program.  It has been a real blessing as well as a challenge to work with many young people who have come and stayed with us over the past 12 years.  I am open to year-long internships with the possibility of joining as a permanent member.  I hope to have short term volunteers in the future.  I welcome folks who would like to visit.

	Our neighborhood concept includes both private home ownership and rental properties, respecting personal privacy, sensitivity to environmental concerns, and is designed for seniors.  In sum, we seek to live simple, independent lives of prayer and outreach where we are available for others in wisdom and grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/roanoke-prayer-and-service/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/roanoke-prayer-and-service/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This SpiritServ Senior Cohousing community is formed around prayer and service in the Roanoke VA valley area. This is being modeled after Elder Spirit in Abingdon VA. We will have about 20 individual patio homes 1 and 2 bedrooms and about 10 apartments.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22325&quot;&gt;The San Diego Wake Up House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The intent of our community can be summarized by one word &quot;support&quot;. We are here to support one another on our respective spiritual journeys with the practice of mindfulness meditation. We do this within the mission statement of the Wake Up Movement: &quot;Young Buddhists and non-Buddhists for a Healthy and Compassionate Society&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-san-diego-wake-up-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-san-diego-wake-up-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
As we see it, spiritual fulfillment is intrinsically interrelated with social justice and environmental sustainability. So we do our part to speak out against social injustice while we do our best to be sustainable (recycle, compost, grow our own food, shop wisely, eat healthy, etc). We are also all vegetarians on the border of being vegan. However, all of our actions are going to reflect where we are with respect to our spiritual condition, so we do our best to practice: &quot;Peace in oneself, peace in the world&quot; -Thich Nhat Hanh. 

Our aspiration is to &quot;be the change we want to see in the world&quot; -Ghandi.
We also see our home as a resource for the community. We open up our doors to practice meditation together every Friday. 

We love to cook and share meals together. We shop together, clean &amp;amp; do chores together, play board games together, go out to eat together, dance together, etc... We all own bikes, love to hike, camp and get out doors! We have a community garden in the back yard with many fruiting trees (fig, avocado, guava, pear, apple, orange, lemon &amp;amp; lime).

We have couchsurfers and friends sleeping in the common areas constantly. However, we have a balance of privacy and all guest's stays over 1 night must be approved by all house mates for it to occur. 

We are located just west of highway 163, south of Genesee and east of Linda Vista road. Our house is a decent sized 1-story, 5 bedrooms, 3 baths and two huge common areas (one of which is a dedicated space for meditation, yoga and community activities). We generally have 6 housemates including 1 couple. 

Check us out if you ever want to stay here &amp;amp; practice with us! Find us on Facebook!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22341&quot;&gt;Willka Hampi (previously Project Taruka)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; - Recovery of Tradition - Authentic Leaders - Sustainable Communities
Our desire is to participate to the global movement currently appearing in our world. This movement, which has long been prophesized by many ancient and authentic traditions and cultures, foresees a great change in humanity; a shift of consciousness which marks the beginning of a Golden Age.

This new era defines new ways of relating in harmony with life, nature and each other in the consciousness of our real identity and human purpose. The time of this prophecy is now emerging with more and more people drawn to living an ecological and self-sufficient life-style within a community or clan, like our ancestors did.
We understand that by serving this global project of humanity each one may find their personal healing within a particular collective weaving. Therefore, our aim is to serve the magic of the healthy dynamic of life, woven between families, communities and projects for a flourishing new society of healthy and awake individuals.
In order to complete with this, our primary focus is dedicated to help people encounter their true motivations and hidden potentialities to serve life and its sacred global movement as an authentic leader, educator, or medicine person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/project-taruka/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/project-taruka/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a culturally diverse community living in the majestic Sacred Valley of Peru (near Pisac, Cusco). 
Our community started to appear about 20 years ago and is now well established.

Our main service is running our formation center (of the mystic arts and sciences of life) which works with ancestral traditions and sacred plant wisdom to make appear leaders, medicine people and a web of communities inter-related around the world. 

Our projects include Shamanism, Leadership, Self-Sufficiency (e.g. organic agriculture, eco-construction such as adobe and tipi, permaculture, ethical trade), Natural Therapy &amp;amp; Medicine, Education, Ecological Science, Inter-Community Weaving, among many more.

We welcome people to encounter our community and projects through our programs. These programs particularly suit those who want to establish their own eco-community, be a leader or shaman, develop themselves in particular science such as medicinal plants, or encounter the skills &amp;amp; knowledge to be a valued member of an established community. 

We offer a long-term formation process (with or without medicine ceremony) where one can eventually integrate into the community as a family member. We have various sites and lands for the expansion of our projects and community and take on a few people each year to integrate into our community on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. 

Our community functions on the base of a traditional clan structure (based on the Sacred or Medicine Wheel) which puts emphasis on the dynamic of the circle. We work with several authentic traditions under a universal and inclusive vision.

Shamanic/ spiritual activities include sweat lodge, communal chanting and meditation, and sacred plant ceremonies.
 
All those staying at our community must abstain from consuming meat, poultry, fish, drugs and alcohol on the premises and follow community rules. 

Visit us at www.willkahampi.org or contact us at contact@willkahampi.org for full details of our community, projects and programs.</description>

Community members live and work together, in beautiful extended family households, forming a mutually supportive environment that enables each individual to discover and develop his or her unique abilities and potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/heartbeet-lifesharing/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/heartbeet-lifesharing/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Located in Hardwick, Vermont, on a 150 acre farm, Heartbeet is a licensed Therapeutic Community Residence recognized by the State of Vermont and has recently been incorporated into the Camphill Association of communities,where everyone, regardless of ability, can find meaning, dignity, and delight in life. Long-term volunteers, adults with special needs, and volunteers who come for a year of service work, learn and play together, celebrating the myriad joys and challenges of life. In Vermont the land is full of rolling mountains and hidden valleys; towns are small and people have to make an effort to reach out to each other. People care about their neighbors and are willing to stand up for what they think is right (we still haveTown Meetings). From its inception Heartbeet has fit right in and is committed to building relationships and cultivating all that is best in the small-town community way of life. Driving up our steep hill, the road opens onto a beautiful view of fields and forest, swim pond and red barn, and three lovely homes. You get the feeling that you have arrived in a place alive with the wonder and joy of the earth and human relationships.

The work we do at Heartbeet is based on a spiritual understanding of the human being, the earth, and the universe. Anthroposophy (literally &quot;the wisdom of the human being&quot;) was conceived by Dr. Rudolf Steiner of Austria in the early decades of the 20th century. Anthroposophy has inspired  innovations in many areas of life, and has given rise not only to Camphill communities, but to Waldorf education, biodynamic agriculture, and new forms of medicine, therapies and the arts. All share a common dream of social, cultural and economic renewal. Our foundation in anthroposophy manifests itself in the recognition that each human being comprises a body, soul, and spirit, and we believe each of these aspects has the capacity to grow, develop and learn. We recognize that each person is on an inner journey, and we can actively support each other by the ways we live, learn, and work together.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22343&quot;&gt;Lake View Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Rescue this amazing Place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/lake-view-community-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/lake-view-community-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='cmtydescription-import'&gt;
Dear Community Seekers,

UPDATE:
This specific house was sold unfortunately to a single family because almost nobody replied to this post and thus I could not find people to buy it with.  It was a one of a kind place, but there will be other special places, perhaps even closer to the city.  I am still interested very much in finding people to start a community with in a similar setting. Thus, let us form a community of like-minded people, agree on a plan and start shopping for a place ! The rest of my description still holds except for anything specific to this - now gone- location.
(end of UPDATE).

I am trying to start a new community from scratch and find 8-10 people who like to live together in an egalitarian community and to buy this truly one-of-a-kind place in Seattle's North Matthews Beach Area (as mentioned above, it is now sold and therefore we have to find something else) together so that we can live free from rampant Seattle rent increases and have a piece of paradise.


My vision is for a multi-generational group of idealistic, curious, open-minded and emotionally invested down to earth people with devotion to good and honest communication (for instance using NVC - nonviolent communication as a guiding principle), who value environmental stewardship, support, serenity, nature, gardening, good food and healthy living and inclusiveness that supports individual identity choice, yet stresses community-mindedness and cooperation and mutual support and a synthesis of spiritual and rational/scientific world view.


If 8-10 people bought the house together, the mortgage may be as low as $320-$400/person (at 5% interest rate for 30 year mortgage). The key is a willingness for community and unfortunately also a good amount of savings, but yet a fraction of what it would take to buy a house by yourself in the Seattle area, much less a house like this.


There is very little time left before this house may end up sold to yet another one-percenter or a sliced up by a greedy developer.


The owners would instead truly love to sell it to a community and keep it available for the common good.

The Template Homestead, an intentional community, was established in 2003. It is a residential community, set on 129 acres, in rural Decatur, Tennessee. 

Its members are also members of the Emin Way, a not-for-profit, and non-denominational, spiritual educational organization (501 c 3).  It is a community, an international gathering of individuals from all walks of life, who are in concert with the belief that human life is a purposeful, spiritual arising, out from an ordered and growing universe.

The understanding of the human’s high purpose is a lifelong discovery process, both as individuals and as a species. We gather around the belief that the universe, God, and the human are an intertwining, evolutary process, each dependent on the other for its progression and refinement.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22348&quot;&gt;Fairy Forest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We CHANGED our NAME!  We are no longer &quot;Creative Sanctuary and Freedom Farm&quot; This idea of building a sustainable village in the forest began when I was a 10 years old. Since then I have been many places and done many things, and now I am finally ready to fullfill my childhood and lifelong dream. I never even knew why I had this dream, really, just did. Then six months ago I met someone I could clearly tell was a clairvoyant, and she told me that I am a fairy. She told me as if I should know this already. She was actually shocked when I told her I didn't know! So, I went home and learned as much as I could about REAL fairies. I read online articles, then I read Doreen Virtue's book about incarnated fairies and now everything about me makes sense! NOW I am SO READY to connect with my encarnated elemental brothers and sisters to demonstrate what living in harmony with nature looks like, and help to inspire the world with our other creative passions! This is why we are here. Come, and stay as long as you like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/creative-sanctuary-and-freedom-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/creative-sanctuary-and-freedom-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Step by step, this is to become a retreat from monetary economies and a sacred space to awaken and experience spiritual discovery in environment full of life, love, and inspiration built to inspire a new way of thinking, living, and creating. Its humanity's time to thrive on Earth.  We are currently looking for creative individuals that are truly optimistic and ambitious about making a positive change in humanity as well as spiritual healers and aspiring healers to come and build a strong community of unconditional love for all. We want to share plant knowledge and earthen-house building as a form of meditation. We are attempting to free ourselves from a monetary economy, so others who are on the same path are welcome to come and share ideas on instigating a resource-based economy. We are very peaceful and open-minded people, and we believe that we must be the change that we see in the world. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions! Peace, love and naked squirrels!</description>

We choose to manifest a life in which we embody the truth of our interconnectedness with all that is, and we commit all that we are to creating health at all levels of being.  We believe that the Earth is sacred and we have chosen a lifeway in which we are healers of her.  For us, nothing that does harm to her is worth the price that must be paid by the future of all life.  We believe we must expand our concept of &quot;self&quot; to include our family, community, and land.  We choose to become indigenous: saturating the land with meaning and story, animating her, blessing her, realizing we are a part of her.  
From our indigenous, animistic, permaculture story we attempt to bring forth a diverse and fecund ecosystem that will nourish our 'whole body'.  We create food forests, marshes, savannah, and perennially-mulched no-till annual polycultures to re-envision food production.  Using highly efficient heaters, super-insulated naturally built buildings, and appropriate site design we decrease our negative impact.  Our life is our love made evident.

      <name>Brotherhood of Christ Church - Essene Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22373&quot;&gt;Brotherhood of Christ Church - Essene Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Daily living your Love for God&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/brotherhood-of-christ-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/brotherhood-of-christ-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
We are a present day Essene Community.  We live a primitive, simple life based on our deeply held convictions of keeping the First Commandment and rejecting worldliness.  Each person strives to give 100% of their life to God, not counting the cost, but attempting to make each thought, feeling, and all one's energy given to loving the Lord. We call ourselves &quot;Brotherhood of Christ&quot; because we view Him as our Brother, not because we are patriarchal - we're not.

We are a deeply religious community.  We allow no violence, swearing, drugs, smoking or alcohol use, nor any sexual activity outside the context of marriage. Our religion is soundly Christian, although no one would recognize it as modern, western Christianity because it comes from an ancient background.  We believe in the spiritual empowerment  that Jesus taught in John 14:12 where He said, &quot;Verily, verily I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do.&quot;

No one person leads, but we have a community Council that makes decisions dealing with long term community issues.  There are several other leadership bodies, all of which make decisions by &quot;common consent&quot; which is conditional unanimity.  The mothers of children under 14 make decisions about family needs, medical, special diets, clothing, and other special needs.  The fathers of children under 14 manage all the farming and land usage.  The grandparents or &quot;older elders&quot; decide on matters dealing with equality, parenting needs, education, wisdom and advice.  All men of religious service decide about worship matters.  There is a Storehouse Board made up of members of each of the other groups who decide financial expenditures each month.  Only two people drive or spend money for all the full members in Community.  We keep a version of the Community Rule found in the Dead Sea Scrolls.  We encourage interested persons to listen to our class series Christ View: A Perspective for Christian Community available at the &quot;business, project&quot; link in the upper right corner of this page.  This series gives a good taste of our religious viewpoint.  Hope you enjoy it!

We are a horse and buggy community.  We use draft horses to farm nearly 1200 acres.  We raise almost all our own food, although we still buy salt, sugar (in small quantities), cooking oil, and yeast.  We sew much of our own clothing.  We use horses to power our machine shops and all our equipment, including the laundry houses.

      <name>Foundational Living Colony of New Eden</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22375&quot;&gt;Foundational Living Colony of New Eden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; TO HELP THE PUBLIC GAIN THE CLEAREST UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT MEANS TO COMMUNE WITH FELLOW MAN, WOMAN, AND GOD AS ONE KINGDOM UNDER HEAVEN
The Foundational Living Colony stands for the &quot;Foundational Truths&quot; found in the Word of God, specifically the book of Genesis Chapter One, where it speaks about CREATION, the SIX DAYS OF CREATION and the DAY OF REST to recover. The Theme of CREATION will flow through the Community as each Day of Creation is emphasised; the &quot;Living&quot; we are promised as Children of God, as Yeshuah the Lord said, &quot;I have come to give them life, and life in abundance!&quot; with the attitude that we are &quot;colonists&quot; on this Earth, who have no permanent &quot;Home&quot;, but seek a greater Homeland; the freedom of creativity, enjoyment, education, teaching, encouraging, entertainment, discipline, and especially SERVICE to God and one another through SHARING with one another what we have, and especially our excess with any in need; we stand for all the ancient practical vocations in life that make it self-sufficient and self-generating which will ALWAYS be in demand for the human body;  Because we grow our own food, medicine, collect our own water, and produce our own children, teach our own children, we are thus able to be completely self-sufficient without the need to buy or sell anymore anything from the store with money, or associate with any dangerous influences or trouble or terror anymore. It is self generating and foundational from the ground up, and includes every establishment necessary for fullness of life, and the self-sustaining life for all of us in the pastoral environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/foundational-living-colony-of-new-eden/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/foundational-living-colony-of-new-eden/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Foundational Living Colony stands for Creation, fullness of life, enjoying life to it's fullest extent, the way it was in the beginning, is now, and will be forever. Foundation stands for the foundational things that make life life, where we are &quot;living&quot; creatures, having many gifts, talents and abilities, working together as a &quot;team&quot; for the building of a habitation of Rest for all people, a self-sustaining, self-generating community, and &quot;colony&quot; is a gathering of people who are &quot;pilgrims&quot; on earth, and like an ant colony works together to build their ant hill, the Colony works together as a team, nobody greater or lesser than the other, but for the sake of equality we work, and are servants to each other. The greatest here will be the servant of all. Service and a life of service is what the Colony is all about. 
 The Living Colony is to have eleven establishments encompassing the full nature of life in enjoyment that will be built. It is a University Campus in form with educational opportunities for all, with a classroom environment and &quot;hands-on activities for each hour of the day, an hour each day set aside for each subject: music, gardening, livestock, carpentry, art, Physician Healing Arts, Bird and Fish environments, military training and discipline, teamwork practice, and Theater and Entertainment:
1. The Resting Deer Lodge- The Lodge is the central hub in the community, where all gather for rest, for a cup of tea, mate, or coffee, to relax and listen to calming music, where people can speak, read poetry, lecture, and be heard. It is a place of meditation, rest and healing for all.
2. The Morning Star Music Hall- The music hall is where all gather for hearing the choir, the musical instruments, and where all dance.
3. The Garden and Greenhouse- The Garden will consist of all 12 vegetable families, the Orchard with Apples and the Vineyard of Grapes; while the Greenhouse will grow the Meditteranean Trees like the Olive tree, Pomegranite, Date Palm, Coconut Palm, Fig tree and more; a medicinal garden of herbs also with Rosemary, Sage, Thyme, Lavender, Valerian, and more
4. The Physician's Healing Center and Apothecary- This center is to have access to all the trees, herbs, and medicines, Gemstones, with Frankinsence and Myrrh, to have all necessary medicines to heal all diseases, give massages, footbaths to release toxins, and more. Vegetarian nutrition is encouraged, the most universal health care for all people.
5. The Architectural Construction Center_ The Construction Center is to have the necessary saw-mills, tools, and instruments for the construction of the Livestock Stables, chicken coops, dog houses, posts, beams, rafters, chairs, furniture, and other items. Universal construction method is the Joint and Tennon method, the most secure and stable method.
6. The Military Training Facility- The Training Facility will train people for military discipline, respect, fitness, teamwork, and good morale among all. There will be excercises, salutes, marching, and battle strategy and battle re-enactments, team sports like basketball, capture-the-flag, and flag football. 
7. The Astrological Space Center- The Space Center will teach people the stars, constellations, signs, seasons, calendars, and the beauty of the Heavens. The twelve constellations of the zodiac will be taught and studied, and the other 88 constellations of the universe.
8. Livestock area and sheepfold- The livestock area will include all necessary livestock: sheep, goats, cattle, and all pets, horse stable with horses. There will be no slaughter of animals, but only the milk, wool, and horse-power will be used. No death of animals will take place but they will be used for what they are. 
9. Fish Marina and Bird Sanctuary- The fish will be stocked in a central pond and a swale or trough dug around the campus, where fish will be. There is to be a continual flow of water sourced by fountain pumps and water wheels to collect water. The central water source is to have a fountain and enclosed by the Resting Deer Lodge in the center. Birds shall have relative confinement but the freedom to fly as the please. Tame birds like parakeets and parrots are encouraged, yardbirds like cardinals and finches also encouraged and fed daily. 
10. Entertainment, play and skit Amphitheater- The entertainment center will be for the entertainment of the people; where plays are enacted, skits, martial arts demonstrations, stories read and characters given lines and parts then enacted in plays. It will bring refreshment to all and lighten the mood for everyone involved. 
11. Resurrection Burial Chambers- Preparation for our dead is necessary and vital. Proper care of any who die is a standard. Bodies are &quot;embalmed&quot; (preserved) with the preservational medicines of Aloe Vera and Myrrh Gum by dipping strips of cloth into an Aloe/Myrrh mixture and wrapping the bodies with that. This is done once every week. We are to care for the body even after death. Burial Chambers are to be built similar to a root cellar, yet with more eloquence. Chambers can be built with concrete slab foundation, cinder block walls, cedar or pine or acacia wood for the roof, and six feet of earth piled on top by a buldozer or a team of shovelers. The Chambers are to have a double-door entrance where those who embalm the dead can go freely in and out at will. This is the standard for all who die and proper care of the body after death. 
These are the eleven establishments for the Foundational Living Colony. All are welcome, young, middle aged, and elderly, all gifts, talents and abilities also encouraged. No one should be left out, but all welcome to engage in this great learning, building, and fellowship practice here. This is for the good of all people, all races, all ages, all men and women both; there is no partiality here. Come one and all and enjoy this process with me. Let us enjoy life again to it's fullest extent and be not hindered by anything. You are free to serve, you are not slaves. Welcome, and come soon!</description>

      <name>Farming in Willamette Valley region</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22385&quot;&gt;Farming in Willamette Valley region&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Together to create a truly sustainable community 
 By supplying most of our daily physical needs from the land
 While fulfilling most of our social and spiritual needs nearby and with each other&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/farming-in-willamette-valley-region/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/farming-in-willamette-valley-region/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Welcome and good Day. I'm Kevin Jones age 50 and I live near Eugene, Oregon; I've been farming organically and biodynamically and homesteaded for the last 20 years; much along the way has been a journey toward community.
While farming and homesteading, I've noticed again and again that this all would be so much better if it were a group endeavor--More social and rewarding, more efficient, and more sustainable. Farming as I've chosen to, is not a good way to make much money, but it is a great way to feed oneself. I don't import lots of resources or use much machinery so I don't compete in the market place that doesn't value my more sustainable ways. The community farm envisioned would employ draft animals, methane digesters, farm animals, solar and wind power etc, and would have/build the components necessary for a simple yet well functioning farm and community.
  I've searched for compatible communities in my region and around the country. There are some, but not nearby. So I feel called to start one.
They come in all shapes and size, and the one I'd like to be part of growing hopefully will value these ideas or at least allow me to 

~ An awareness of and responsibility to self, relationship with others and spirit.
  (this is hard to distill, yet the key, it involves honor and a commitment to a willingness to accept and resolve differences and challenges in our lives with others and our self; to remain in healthy relation) Striving to live at peace.
~ A consensus approach with consideration for sociocracy and other forms of successful governance. Creation of community rules and agreements including a pet policy
~ A positive long range view, considering future generations
~ Shared land ownership with personal ownership of a home
~ Living a very 'self sufficient' life on a community scale
~ A strong commitment to deriving our needs from our place and
  organic and non GMO foods
~ Choosing a location within easy use of public transportation 
~ Living within our means financially and encouraging those with more, giving more 
~ Creating times of play, fun and joy, and spiritually enriching ceremony

I read a quote by Vandana Shiva &quot;In natures economy the currency is not money it is life.&quot;  And being part of nature and humanity I value money some but life more, especially in respect to time and my ability to participate in much of what I think brings me life and perhaps offers life benefits to others.

 So I'd like to attract and form a core group of compatible people who would like to lay the foundation for an agricultural village (ecovillage.) To start, I'd prefer to make contact with people who have 10+ years of experience homesteading, or living and working on organic, biodynamic or permaculture farms and/or in useful skill trades; and community living experience would be a great asset. I'd prefer to hear from people who reside now in Oregon or the Northwest and who share most if not all of the values I've mentioned

I've lived in community for a short while and have studied many others extensively and would like to encourage the use of the many tools and examples available that appear to be successful. Diana L. Christian's books for example.

So some of my personal interests include finding clever solutions, food and cooking, singing, games, my family, and woodworking with hand tools, basketball, frisbee and tennis, water and canoeing.

Understand, I don't own the land I currently steward, and hope to put my assets with others' to buy land, once trust and agreements have been established.
If you think we maybe compatible, I'd like to talk; please take the first step and call or E-mail me. Maybe a visit to see what we've developed on the land we currently care for will be appropriate.
Thanks, Kevin

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22386&quot;&gt;Quetzalcoatl Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We heal the Earth as we heal ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ascension-hill-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ascension-hill-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
This community is forming for those who are ready to heal themselves, others and the Earth. Each member has already apprenticed with a shamanic tradition or is in the process. We offer an apprenticeship for those who would like to live here and have not yet experienced the shamanic tradition. We grow organic food together, cook meals for each other on occasion and enjoy ceremony to heal the Earth. The property has some of the best water in the country. Members can rent or buy adjacent property. 

The rural lifestyle in a quiet, fairly isolated area surrounded by National Forest, requires participants to have some source of income. We are working on a couple of businesses that eventually will employ more people. Smoking cigarettes is not allowed on the property.</description>

Our house has twelve bedrooms, two kitchens, a cat, some fish, and a two-story rope swing.
 We live together, not as individuals merely cohabitating, but as an extended family, supporting and loving one other.
 The community extends beyond our house into the neighborhood at-large. There are many people who spend many hours here, but live at other addresses close by.
 Our community includes artists, environmentalists, musicians, educators, social workers, advocates, and students.
 We often take group trips to concerts, art shows, hiking, and other such outings. We cook and brew beer, garden and dance, play music and make art, travel and read together.
 We have potlucks every Sunday evening, and we welcome visitors to this weekly feast!</description>

Have you ever felt drawn to something different than the status quo? Does the American dream not quite ring true for you? Do you dream of a community of peaceful Christ followers that live simply, do good, and love others without all the dogma and legalism? Are you passionate about Jesus and want desperately to find a group of believers who want to return to the love and passion of the early church but don't feel comfortable with the denominations you've been a part of? Maybe it's time for something new. I personally have an undying passion for Christ and his church, but I find that every time I'm &quot;church&quot; I feel like I’m watching a production, and once I'm away from the noise and the lights and music, I feel emptier than ever... my vision is an intentional community of believers that strives to reflect the early church. I’m not quite sure what it will look like, but here are a few ideas.
•	Co-housing and daily communal prayer and worship. Shared chores and at least one meal daily. 
•	Ministering to the community in areas of homelessness, social work, maybe eventually a food pantry. 
•	various outreaches
•	sustainability and ecological stewardship
•	A diverse, multicultural, group of Jesus lovers from all walks of life! 

There have been a few to attempt what I’m dreaming up, but before you write it off as another cult, look up Jesus people and the simple way, some others have the same idea and are doing it right! Together we can make this happen!
If you like what you’ve read and want to start a dialogue email me at machaseh@yahoo.com (it’s Hebrew for refuge ^_^)

We are 13 persons--couples and singles-- who share a common life and ministry in a large house in the Irvington neighborhood of Portland, Oregon.  Sharing includes income, possessions, time, affection and a Christian faith that is ecumenical, open and inclusive.  Ministries include (a) community building, (b)peacemaking through personal witness and non-violent action, (c)hospitality, including a free weekly meal for low income, homeless people and (at times) free on site hospice care for persons who are dying, and (d)support for persons who are grieving because of personal loss and/or the disintegration of the social order.

Every morning we gather for community prayer and Bible study, and every evening we share a common meal.  Visitors are encouraged to join us for these activities, although in the case of supper we ask people to call us ahead of time.

In 2011 we celebrated our 25th anniversary.  Four of the original founding members of the household are still here after these many years.

Candelaria Madidi Ecológico is a community created
with the purpose of implementing ecological projects that will aid in the conservation of a 35,000 hectare territory adjacent to the most critical part of Madidi National Park. The organization is composed mainly of native people from all over Bolivia that share the interest of protecting this region through innovative eco-projects. This area  is one of the most critical in the Amazon region since it's one of the last  biological corridors between the Andean foothills and the Amazon plains has not been interrupted by human presence. Ironical to the enormous size of Madidi National Park, this most critical region is the least protected, being so by a thin bottleneck only fourteen kilometres wide. Candelaria Madidi is the terrain adjacent to this bottleneck and the protection of this area is of great importance. For this reason Candelaria Madidi Ecologico has been fighting to establish this area as a community owned protected area and we are now begin projects that will create funds that will allow real conservation and protection efforts to be continuously carried out.

Community status: 

Ecotoursim project: A 1,000,000 dollar ecotourism project has been designed and is currently being presented to grant institutions. 

Healing center and center for universal knowledge project: A project that involves creating a unified global and ancient knowledge center, a universal wisdom school, a universal healing center. This project is in the design phase.

Ecovillage status: We are looking for people interested in being part of our community. We are currently designing a community layout and are offering different ways to include new members. check the page http://altomadidiproject.blogspot.com/p/community.html -english under construction, check the spanish page http://altomadidi.blogspot.com/p/comunidad.html-to see in which ways you can join this community. 

VOLUNTEERS: We certainly need help from people interested in HELPING this project and the community happen. We welcome people with proposals on how they could help.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22435&quot;&gt;Akakor Pagan Permaculture Farming Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Self-sovereign permaculture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/akakor-pagan-permaculture-farming-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/akakor-pagan-permaculture-farming-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Liberty, Love and Honour eternal.

We are natural lifestyle Pagan spirits with strong sustainable permaculture ethics.

We are nature loving progressive naturalists/nudists in tune with Gaia and cosmic consciousness.  We consider ourselves &quot;space-tribe&quot; - of the greater family of souls throughout the cosmos.  As important as our physical &quot;3D&quot; reality is, for us, spirit comes first - lifestyle second.

Akakor is our home as much as it is our business, and our plans are as realistic today as they are forward-thinking towards the future.

Ethanol fuel production from Hemp greens and cleans the planet instantly, both locally and globally.  We have spent years planning this business and community and have all the facts available regarding zero carbon emissions and transition fuels for the population during this age as we travel through 2012 and beyond into smaller sustainable self-reliant communities of the future (rather than large over-consuming cities choking on industrial pollution).

We can produce our own power from our own green fuel as well!  This is a huge bonus for us as a sustainable independent permaculture community.

Organic farming is viable for both local food production and self-sustainability and is equally important for our community farm although not the focus of our initial business plans.  We wish to help the world heal around us as much as gain land for our future survival together in peace while utilizing a realistic common-sense business model to build from.

The founder of this community started many years ago as a freelance investigative journalist which partly led to some of the knowledge added to this project.

Our primary household is Pagan, vegetarian, polyamorous, omnisexual, progressive nudist, exopolitically involved, etc... an independent, self-sovereign &quot;nation&quot; of growing people... a home where animals &quot;are people too&quot; who deserve as much love as we share among ourselves.

We are open to applications from new members at this time.  Screening will be thorough, and security and future-minded.  This is a massively important vision which will not stray from its course.

The future farm is located in the British Columbia interior.</description>

We're looking to unite with others who may be looking to form a striving to live in Torah based community.  The vision that we have is one in which we unite (become echad) to buy a piece of land somewhere. (we have bought land and houses in N MS ?)  or (where ever the RUACH (Set apart holy spirit leads us - right now in N MS) Where we may  develop our hearts, minds and bodies to serve the MOST HIGH YHVH and His son YAHHUASHUA led by the RUACH HA CHODESH  and to be able to produce as much of our basic needs (food, water, shelter, energy, heat, etc.). This community would be for folks who are seeking the truth of the creator YHVH and his son our redeemer Yahshua Ha Maschiach through the revelation given to us in his word the Torah, (laws or commandments) the prophets and the writings {Holy Bible).  We're looking for folks that are able to get along with people who are searching for the truth of the sacred Scriptures and if they have differing views on issues concerning the chodesh set apart holy names, the moedim holy chodesh set apart dates and how they are observed, the wearing of beards, tzitzits, kippahs,(whether you wear them or not)  women's roles and clothing, whether you feel that you must use their Sacred names and how or not to use them at all, if you still use the name of Jesus ? Yahshua or not (by what name did you first come to His knowledge?).  I'm looking for people that are understanding enough to know that you must learn to love your neighbor as yourself and let people worship the Son and the Father as they feel led to.  This is not to say that that we should wink at sin and allow open sin in the camp.  This is meant to give people the freedom and room to allow for variations in the way people honor Our Creator in the manner in which we feel led to.  I'm looking to join up with people can agree to love their neighbors even if they do something that they may not completely agree with.  Bottom line is if you see what's coming down the road and you still want to argue and disagree about all things mentioned above and any other points that I'm sure I missed, please don't reply to this posting, but if you can see the writing on the wall for this nation and would like to become as echad (united) as you can with others (on the points you can be united on and leaving the ones you're not aside for study), then please by all means contact me as soon as possible!</description>

This community project is currently on hold as we reorganize our efforts to be able to better meet the needs of the human collective currently incarnate. The original community description is below. Please read on and feel free to email us if you'd like to be contacted when we restart. 
We have met many beautiful soulmates on the journey towards creating a sustainable spiritually-focused community. However, it has become clear that very few are ready at this time to be part of a full-blown community building effort long term. This has resulted in a lot of turn-over and a lot of visitors, which has impeded progress. Instead of struggling with this situation and only being able to serve the very few who are ready for true heart-centered, spiritually-aware community, we have decided to reorganize and form a retreat center of sorts, likely a meditation sanctuary where classes will be offered, so that we can meet the needs of the many. This restructuring will require a lot of changes and more money. We are in the process of making those changes and raising the money needed to continue. We anticipate 2014 as being the year in which we will be able to restart in earnest. Please send us an email and we will keep you in the loop. Blessings and thanks for your interest.

The Goddess's Temple Wiccan Village is a center for training in Wicca. It is a school where many seasoned priestesses and priests are available to impart their knowledge and life experiences with people interested in threading a Wiccan sacerdotal pathway or in knowing that pathway better.

We are a center for communal living, studying and celebrating the Goddess. We have places dedicated to worshiping, to learning, and to living a pagan lifestyle.

Though this is a Wiccan community, we may accept members of all creeds, as long as they abide to Brazilian legislation against religious prejudice, and agree to participate in all community's activities that are not religion oriented.

holds it as sanctuary for education and cultural transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/emerald-earth/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/emerald-earth/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Emerald Earth is a 26-year-old intentional community in rural Mendocino County. We have 189 acres of mixed redwood and hardwood forest; open, south-facing meadows with majestic oaks; two springs; a pond; and a seasonal creek. The land is held in trust by a 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation.

Our values include sustainable living, simplicity, social and environmental justice, and reverence for the Earth and all living things. Our mission is to develop and demonstrate a model of living in harmony with the land and with each other. The original founding group was and is committed to developing our spiritual connection to the Earth through ritual, song, and seasonal celebrations.

We teach short workshops and longer professional training in natural building (including cob, strawbale, slipstraw, round pole framing, adobe floors, natural plasters, etc.) and permaculture. We are developing the infrastructure for 20 permanent residents plus guests, interns, and students. We use natural materials and our own labor to keep costs and environmental impact low. We are off grid, with solar and hydro-electricity, a cell phone, and satellite internet. We share meals, meet, and socialize in a common house that is still under construction. Each family or individual will have a small private cabin (six have been completed). We're also working on gardens, permaculture food forest, nursery, more ponds, etc.

Founded in 1982, Agape is a lay Catholic nonviolent community dedicated to prayer, poverty, nonviolent education and ministry, and witnessing in the world. We are ecumenical and interfaith in orientation.
We accept volunteers for any length of time to work in our garden and assist with homesteading, including maintenance of our two buildings, St. Francis House and St. Brigid House (a straw bale house with solar energy and a composting toilet). We drive a car that runs on vegetable oil.
We welcome interns for stays of three months to a year. Currently, we are interested in a full commitment of nine months. We live on 32 acres of land in the Quabbin Reservoir in central Massachusetts.
We support ourselves through a nonviolent education ministry, donations and grants--which includes outreach to inner-city youths and adults--retreats, and other programs at the community. We host a variety of educational groups who are interested in sustainability. 
We pray together, study Scripture, and witness out of this base against all forms of violence.
We welcome people who have a yearning for a community life based on prayer, simplicity, and nonviolence. No TV or commercial radio but lots of music and a definite love of art in all its forms.
Those drawn to Agape will interact with hundreds of people throughout the year, including college students who attend Agape's twice-yearly retreats. Office work, computer assistance, gardening, homesteading of all kinds, and public witness and outreach are a part of our lives, as is contact with children.
Website: www.agapecommunity.org

We publish a community journal, Servant Song, and we are interested in the links between sustainability, the arts and spirituality, as well as in resistance to war through simple lifestyle.

Our work includes attending vigils for peace and joining in protests, as well as organizing around issues of resistance to violence. We do all of our resistance in the spirit of nonviolence. Contemplation and action are underpinnings of our lives.

We are also beginning a search for a long-term intern who would be able to commit to more than a year of time. We are looking for someone who has community experience, as well as an interest and a background in sustainability and nonviolence. Please contact us for more information if interested.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22504&quot;&gt;Jesus Christians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Love God and our neighbour, with all our heart, mind, soul and strength.  To see that of God in everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/jesus-christians/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/jesus-christians/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
We have been operating as a community for more than 25 years.  Our community grew out of an experiment with literal obedience to the teachings of Jesus.  Although we don't fit into any neat category, we have often been referred to as Christian anarchists, and we practice what is considered to part of the gift economy.  We keenly support much that Leo Tolstoy wrote about the &quot;kingdom of heaven&quot;, and there is a strong resonance with early Quaker principles. 
Because we believe that attitudes toward money are fundamental in all human relationships, &quot;living in community&quot; for us includes &quot;common ownership&quot;.  No member of our community works for money, and we generally live a very frugal lifestyle.  We believe in the philosophy of doing all that we do for love and without a profit motive.  Many of our members are freegans, living largely off things that the rest of society throws away.
We are a mobile community, regularly on the move to preach the Word and nourish the Kingdom of God wherever, and in whomever, we find it.

We are an intentional Christian community, associated with the Mennonite Church. Located in rural Illinois, we are part of Shalom Mission Communities, with involvement especially in Central America. We welcome those who acknowledge Jesus as Lord of their lives and wish to share in our life together as a part of discipleship.

Values of mutual respect, justice, compassion for the poor, fidelity in marriage, and pacifism form the core of our life together. Hospitality and being connected with other cultures through personal relationships are also important in our shared life.

Some of our members work at a variety of jobs in the larger community, while others help in the farming, growing fruits and vegetables using methods that are environmentally friendly.

As a church we have both communal and noncommunal members. The Fellowship is the communal part and has 10 adults and 2 kids. The noncommunal church members include 4 adults and 2 children. Another family living here is active, but has not chosen membership and another family moving here in the spring. (Numbers as of January 2014.)

The international Benedictine monastic order of sisters and brothers looks to Saint Benedict of Nursia, Italy, (480-547), the Patriarch of Western Monasticism, as its founder and inspiration. In the sixth century A.D., he wrote what we know as the Rule of Benedict or Regula Benedicti that continues to inspire and direct authentic Benedictine communities.

The Catholic Worker Movement lives the vision of Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin, who believed that a peaceable revolution would result if people imitated Jesus Christ’s nonviolence (Matt 5:38-48), voluntary poverty (Matt 6:24, 19:16-26), and radical hospitality (Matt 25:31-46).  The BCR/CW is an ecumenical Christian intentional community that tries to live, pray and work with each other.  We offer housing, food, and love to people facing homelessness.  The BCR/CW is autonomous and has no institutional connection to the Roman Catholic Church.  We are not a 501c3 and donations are not tax-deductible.  We perform the works of mercy and nonviolently oppose the works of war.  We strive to practice the Sermon on the Mount, community living, voluntary poverty, personalism, and care for children and the environment.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22537&quot;&gt;Noldorath Forest Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Live and work in Nature, in harmony with Nature and each other.  Personal responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/noldorath-forest-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/noldorath-forest-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Intro.  I am willing to share my 20 ha of old growth forested land with others like minded.  People who wish to live and work in native forest, to work with Nature (no poisons, no bulldozing), to work to make this forest a delightful and supportive place for people live in,  to build a sense of community, and to cultivate a spiritual practice supportive of these important things.
My community proposal is for people without capital to buy and develop land.

Accommodation.  Live outdoors,  in the forest, using tarp roofs (details under “Housing”)

Principles : No drugs no alcohol. Keep the forest unburnt.  This means  :   RAKE and maintain the perimeter firebreak and no unsafe fires. Develop the organic vegie garden and orchard.   Share costs like – land rates, diesel to shops, tools, phone and internet. 

Aspirations : cultivate good relationships with others, relying partly on sharing spiritual and healing practices. Meet to share music, meditation, healthy shared meals, therapeutic massage, Tai Chi, perhaps even co-counselling.

Spiritual Practice.  Learn forest meditation to reconnect with the Ancient Mother, cultivate contentment, appreciation and joyfulness, and cultivate Presence and Being as Eckhart Tolle uses these words.  Work with Presence and without rush. Practice “mindfulness” in the Buddhist sense.  Integrate spiritual practice with healing.  Study spiritual writings relevant to these objectives.  Campfires at night instead of electronic screen entertainment.

      <name>Morningland Monastery</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22540&quot;&gt;Morningland Monastery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The focus of our community is to maintain a sanctuary for the practice of Maha-Anu-Ati-Yoga. This practice unites body, mind and spirit in seva: devotional service performed by serving our community with repurposed food and goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/morningland-monastery/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/morningland-monastery/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;COMMUNITY DESCRIPTION: Morningland Monastery is a non-residential lay-monastery and spiritual community formed around the teachings of our guru, Sri Donato. Founded in 1973, we are an offline urban community that maintains a sanctuary of Healing, peace and meditation for the purpose of practicing Maha-Anu-Ati-Yoga, which is a Kundalini path. The Kundalini, the light of God in all people, is raised through the Shaktipat of Sri Donato through her spiritual successors, the Gopis. The Gopis are a monastic order of women who run the Monastery. Maha-Anu-Ati-Yoga is a practice deeply rooted in both Eastern and Western dharma teachings on devotional service as a spiritual practice. Seva, selfless service, is the cornerstone of our community and is accessible to all. Our core principles are non-violence, mindfulness and seva. Our seva is to feed our local community and surrounding city with repurposed food, goods and spiritual services. Each month, we feed hundreds of people. Most of our members maintain professional and family lives, and attend in the evening and weekend. Due to our urban location, members maintain private, small group residences. 
We do not maintain an internet presence and rely on word-of-mouth. Nor do we keep digital records about visitors and members; we are digitally unplugged in this regard. At a time when so much work and life require being online or on a computer, we think it’s  refreshing to take a break now and then. Our sanctuary is a place to do this.
Our dharma tradition acknowledges and builds on the essential truths of esoteric Christianity, Yoga, and Buddhism. Our tradition is indigenous to Morningland Monastery. Our teachers, the Gopis, provide instruction in spiritual practice for self-realization that is sustainable in a busy modern life, and workable in a diversity of lifestyles.
Year round, we offer classes in meditation and yogic practices. Visitors are welcome to attend our weekly Dharma Talk where the ceremony of Shaktipat is takes place monthly.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22559&quot;&gt;Valley of Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Valley of Light is a sustainable spiritual community dedicated to the Principle of Peace and to the Universal Laws of Truth, Love, and Light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-valley-of-light/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-valley-of-light/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Valley of Light is a micro-community founded by members of The Oracle Institute, a 501(c)(3) educational charity and think tank which serves as an advocate for Peace and a vanguard for Conscious Evolution. Oracle operates an award-winning publishing house, a multi-faith spirituality school, and a global peacebuilding practice. Recently, Oracle organized the “Building the New World” conference at Radford University, which FIC co-sponsored.

The Valley of Light (“VOL”) is a sustainable, spiritual community located in a high energy region within the New River Valley of Virginia. VOL is nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains in a small town called Independence. We have 22 stunning acres along the New River, which is the oldest river in the Western Hemisphere and the third oldest river in the world. 

VOL Members are aware that the world is on the verge of a major paradigm shift, the likes of which we have not witnessed in 2000 years. The worldwide resurgence of religious fundamentalism coupled with emerging New Age theosophies are just two indicators that we are in the midst of intense spiritual confusion and a looming sociological transformation. 

VOL Members also are cognizant of the many unprecedented factors contributing to this turbulent period, including: global warming, food and water shortages, pandemic indicators, terrorism, energy limitations, and a lack of visionary focus by political and business leaders. We therefore believe that the key to a smooth transition into the 21st Century is the adoption of a new way of living based on an awareness of the interconnectedness of all life. To that end, Oracle and VOL are committed to creating a model micro-community using the most advanced community on the planet as our template: The Federation of Damanhur in Italy.

Currently, VOL is building the “Peace Pentagon,” our community center and headquarters for our charity, The Oracle Institute. From the Peace Pentagon, we will expand our peace programs to include a multi-media “HUB.” VOL is designing the HUB with Barbara Marx Hubbard and a team of IT experts. Ms. Hubbard has visited the Peace Pentagon and supports a bicoastal HUB network, with the East Coast HUB at the Valley of Light in Independence, Virginia, and the West Coast HUB in Berkeley, California.

for the sake of a Culture of Peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/q/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/q/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Q is a individual and small groups retreat space surrounded by nature,
where to experience a simple and conscious lifestyle, with low environmental impact.
A place where to internalize, meditate, change habits, become aware, be oneself.

In Q we experience a modus vivendi that integrates 3 key dimensions of human life: 
Economy, Ethics and Spirituality. 3 essential spheres for local and planetary sustainability.

We experiment and inquire with the following purposes in the middle and long term:

1. At the economic level:
To move towards an economic system based 50% on monetary exchange and 50% in
non-monetary exchange, where gradually the use of money is reduced and the barter, 
the social links and networks, is proportionally increased.
To do this, we consider essential: reducing the needs, optimizing the management of all 
resources, and establishing organic working times and rhythms linked to natural cycles.

2. At the ethical level:
To establish a community of 6 like-minded people, able to develop an agile and effective 
organization without leader. A conjunction of &quot;ones&quot; co-directing Q. This requires in each 
person full capacity for self-determination, initiative and performance; lot of awareness,
responsibility and transparency.

3. At the spiritual level:
To strengthen the circle of people who choose Q to do their practices, initiations and 
teachings, individually and small groups retreats. We provide a space open to all non dual 
traditions. And a neutral place for inter-and-transreligious meetings.</description>

-A world in which all people, human and non-human, and plants live in a balanced, equal, and completely sustainable relationship.
-A world in which all people contribute to each others spiritual, emotional, and mental development by supporting each person's authentic expression and playful exploration.

Mission:
-To create a sustainable ecovillage which functions as a base for people to live in balance and compassion while fully expressing their authentic selves.
-To create a space for people to visit and learn about sustainability and spiritual development.
-To live neo-tribally as a mindful and compassionate community which supports each member with each step on whichever life path they choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ubuntu-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ubuntu-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ubuntu is a Zulu word which translates roughly to mean &quot;human kindness,&quot; but the first time we ever heard the term it was explained to mean &quot;I am because we are.&quot; Either way, it is the philosophy around which our community is based. Ubuntu Ecovillage is a forming ecovillage (a community based around sustainability) that is committed to community based living and mutual spiritual and philosophical growth. 

We share common spiritual practices based on New Age, Earth-based religions, Eastern religions, and New Thought. Our common living practices are inspired by Daniel Quinn's New Tribalism, and are focused on a responsible, equal, and natural human relationship with the Earth and non-human people (animals). As such, our diet is ovo-vegetarian, and all members are committed to a practice of compassion toward all living things.</description>

Our secondary goal is to develop an Eco-Village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/true-self-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/true-self-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;True Self Eco-Village is a center where we envision spiritual practitioners can gather to help one another deepen their knowledge of Who we truly are and establish a sustainable way of life in an Eco-Village setting. In order to initiate these goals, we need to assemble a group of co-founders who would meet regularly in Spokane, WA for the purpose of discussing the type of community that participants would like to form. At this time, we can determine where people's interests lie and learn what they can commit themselves to doing in a collectively implemented project.

During these meetings, we could discuss how this vision would fit into our lives. We could focus on related and practical goals people might be ready to commit to actualizing. We already have a well-maintained homestead where we have striven to live a food and energy self-reliant lifestyle since 1990. This would be a ready made setting for those who sense this to be a stable foundation upon which to build a sustainable way of life. People might want to join us in this lifestyle and set up households or camp sites. Or, members may want to support the establishment of a CSA where they could come to the farm once a week to collect baskets of fresh, organically grown produce. Using a land trust format seems to be the most practical approach which would integrate the co-founders into becoming the Trustees and Beneficiaries of this trust.

In the planning process, we can carefully consider what each individual could commit their energies to in the development of this Eco-Village and write up its mission statement, other important documents and material details. We can also discuss how we might combine our efforts with other aware individuals, who are not members of our co-op effort, in order to help one another transit the social and environmental crisis unfolding in The World. In the near future, the importance of developing such cooperative and collaborative infrastructures cannot be understated.

We are also receptive to dialoguing with those who are interested in associate memberships. Those who might live in distant locations could become involved in the Eco-Village in supportive roles. We also have an opportunity available for a couple or individual with organic growing experience who would like to join us in the capacity of stewards of the land and to establish a CSA. We have the necessary growing infrastructures and tools, and all profits would go to the growers as we do not need any compensation.

Our ultimate wish is to effectively synchronize with those who realize that evolutionary imperatives are calling us to transcend our separateness and to unite our efforts in an intentional community setting. There are many options we are open to exploring, so please take the time to outline where your interests lie and contact us via the email link provided at this site.</description>

We work together to create a living space abundant in food, beauty, harmony and higher self- expression that sustains our needs for survival and thrival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/one-song-eco-spirit-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/one-song-eco-spirit-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Aloha,

We are looking for apprentices and/or potential permanent residents with experience and passion for working and learning with the Aina and growing food. We are an established community and a mature permaculture farm.  Our farm began in 2000 with a few old buildings, and now has seven acres of mature permaculture landscaping, buildings and infrastructure.  It's located in a very isolated part of Maui – a 2 ½ hour drive from the main city, much of it on a winding one-lane road.  It's off-grid, but has a large photovoltaic system, solar hot water, a wood-fired sauna, a laundry facility, and two community kitchens. There are two large structures and fifteen smaller hales, providing living space for the fifteen residents and paying guests, in addition to a teepee and open air dome structure for community gatherings.  We offer a weekly public Cafe and open mike, with food prepared primarily from our half-acre garden and on-site food forest.  We have our own beautiful smooth black stone beach down steep cliff steps, with its continual sound of the waves.  

There are several weekly community meetings and circles which everyone is expected to attend. We live according to the &quot;four agreements&quot;, if you're familiar with that book. We share a common spirituality that recognizes our unity with one another and with our Mother Earth. Some meetings are for logistics and some are for personal, community and spiritual growth.  The learning available for apprentices includes diverse aspects of permaculture, gardening, Natural Korean Farming, poultry management (chickens and ducks) integrated into our ponds and gardens similar to the Vietnamese VAC ponds/gardens/livestock classic permaculture system, living in community, food preparation, sharing music, being mentored and engaging in personal spiritual growth.  There is a core group who live here permanently, with the rest of the community made up of younger temporary residents who may stay three months or longer. Everyone has work expectations – minimally four hours a day on average. Some days are free, when someone else is cooking and there aren't any community work projects or events.  On Cafe day we all chip in and do what's necessary to provide a delicious meal for as many as 50-75 outsiders who come to eat, listen, and participate in the open mike event. Work here includes gardening, fruit tree planting, harvest and maintenance, harvesting and cooking vegetables for community meals, cleaning the guest cabins and the main house, coconut harvest and coconut products preparation, building projects, preparing for the Cafe and more.

Our orientation is as a service oriented group of workers dedicated at helping ourselves; each other, humanity and ultimately the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/oblate-community-of-st-paul-iocu/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/oblate-community-of-st-paul-iocu/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Oblate Community of St Paul-IOCU was formed in 1968 by our Reverend, Dr. George Freibott IV, ND, MD(H).  Dr. Freibott was the President and Lifelong Trustee of the American Naturopathic Association (ANA) in New York and Washington D.C., and Idaho (IDANA).  The original ANA was founded in the late 1800s by Dr. Benedict Lust.  An oblate community is a community of like-minded people, families and singles, dedicated to the common purpose of &quot;feeding the hungry, clothing the naked and healing the sick&quot;. Our community is faith-based, nondenominational and service oriented dedicated to helping each other and ultimately the planet. We are students (Oblates) of Naturopathy with a common belief in healing with nature rather than chemicals and invasive surgeries.  We support ourselves by manufacturing a line of products called &quot;Oxygen Therapies Blass.&quot;  Our main product is a nutritional product called &quot;Homozon&quot; developed by Dr. Eugene Blass in the early 20th Century.  Homozon works to detox and cleanse the cells of the body and floods the  body with oxygen.  Dr. Freibott endorsed www.liveoxygen.com as an informational site to inform the public of our products..</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22606&quot;&gt;OIKOS INTENTIONAL COMMUNITY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Oikos Intentional Community has at the core of its mission service to the poorest of the poor and homeless. Discipleship and following Christ in the most authentic way is the intention. We do not seek to convert, but rather to love and serve other, denying ourselves daily and picking up our cross and following Christ.

The Oikos Intentional Community embraces Christian Naturism and hold nude meditation and nude baptismal services.

A WORD ON NUDE BAPTISM FROM OUR DASA

Nude baptism is as old as the time of the Christ. Like nude meditation, nude baptism brings us into oneness with the Elohim and allows us to do as Jesus commanded when He told us not to conform to the world.

I want to outline how this practice is instituted at our Oikos Intentional Community.

Just prior to entering the water the oikourgous (Oikos members, literally meaning keeper of the house.) remove their clothes, for the baptism is received nude.


In the baptism of a oikourgous, the Dasa anoints the forehead, pronounces the formula, and dips the head, then anoints the body with oil and washes the feet of the newly baptized. In the case of women being baptized, a female elder anoints the body and receives the woman as she came out of the water. The Dasa washes her feet.

The nudity expresses the idea of new birth- hence in art the baptizand is shown not only nude but smaller than the baptizer. This manner of representation is not an indication of infant or child baptism but follows artistic convention. The newly baptized person put on a white garment, symbolizing purity

Early Christians were baptized nude and it is highly likely Jesus Himself was baptized nude. One aspect of the symbolism of nakedness was the comparison of Christ, designated as “the second Adam” (see Romans 5:14, 1 Corinthians 15:22,45), with the first Adam prior to The Fall:

   St. Chrysostom, speaking of baptism, says, “Men were naked as Adam in paradise; but with this difference; Adam was naked because he had sinned, but in baptism, a man was naked that he might be freed from sin; the one was divested of his glory which he once had, but the other put off the old man, which he did as easily as his clothes.”


   St. Ambrose says, “Men came as naked to the font, as they came into the world; and thence he draws an argument by way of illusion, to rich men, telling them, how absurd it was, that a man was born naked of his mother, and received naked by the church, should think of going rich into heaven.”

   Cyril of Jerusalem takes notice of the circumstance, together with the reasons of it, when he thus addresses himself to persons newly baptized: “As soon as ye came into the inner part of the baptistry, ye put off your clothes, which is an emblem of putting off the old man with his deeds; and being thus di

vested, ye stood naked, imitating Christ, that was naked upon the cross, who by his nakedness spoiled principalities and powers, publicly triumphing over them in the cross. O wonderful thing! ye were naked, imitating the first Adam, that was naked in paradise, and was not ashamed.”

   So also Amphilochius in the Life of St. Basil, speaking of his baptism, says, “He arose with fear and put off his clothes, and with them the old man… “(Institutes of Biblical Law, p. 758, Presbyterian &amp; Reformed Publishing, 1973).

BY THE REVEREND DASA WILLIAM GRIFFITH OF THE OIKOS COMMUNITY


    																				
  

OPEN AND AFFIRMING

Oikos Intentional Community does not hold the mainstream views about sexuality that the traditional church holds. We are an open and affirming community, welcoming LGBT members. We have a positive view of both sexuality and nudity, and believe the culture and society in which we live has polluted these two wonderful gifts from God. While our society promotes violence, pornography, war as acceptable parts of our culture, that same society views sexuality and nudity as negative elements. This is where society has it wrong. We teach our members how to empower themselves spiritual and lead them into their Oneness with God, their creator, who created us in His image. Our Dasa, Rev. William Griffith believes in studying the mysteries of God as they were intended and believes our lifestyle should reflect simplicy in a wealth driven culture, while promoting the natural beauty that God has bestowed upon humanity. The community is also engaged in social justice, meeting the needs of the homeless and poorest of the poor on the streets, as well as challenging the contemporary pharisees in our churches today.

OUR RULE AND RHYTHM OF LIFE

“Ordered Members” of the Oikos Intentional Community share the common Rhythm of Life by ordering their lives according to the  Oikos Community Rule of Life.
http://www.oikos.community/#!oikos-rule-of-life/c1x7n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/oikos-intentional-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/oikos-intentional-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Oikos Intentional Community is a new monastic community focused on discipleship, common living and serving in the abandoned places of our cities among the homeless and poorest of the poor. Oikos adheres to the 12 Marks of New Monasticism, in addition to others vows of poverty chastity, obedience and humility. Vows depend upon the individual's calling and not mandatory. Observing the 12 Marks is essential. Oikos life resembles that of the early Christians. The leader of the community, our 'Dasa' (meaning servant, slave of...) has taken extreme vows of poverty, chastity and obedience and has chosen to wear a simple dhoti, sandals and a shawl. Community members are to dress simply and as casually as possible.  

ABOUT SUNFLOWER VILLAGE

The Sunflower Village project will be the first residential new monastic community of Oikos to be founded by Reverend Dasa William Griffith.

Sunflower Village is where Dasa has had a vision of building a new monastic Community of Love: creating a healthy, nourishing environment where people can learn the art of living in harmony with one another and with the Earth.

Sunflower Village is intended to be a small, rustic farmstead, and will house a new monastic monastery, It is a continuation and housing facility of the Oikos Intentional Community.

At SunflowerVillage we weave mindfulness into all our daily activities, training ourselves to be mindful throughout the day: while eating, walking, working, or enjoying a cup of coffee or tea together. The practice of Christian Naturism is a fixture of the  Village, and will be a beautiful, nourishing, simple environment in which to cultivate the mind of awakening.

As we do at Oikos, we enjoy periods of silence, sitting meditation, rest, relaxation, mindful work and play. All practitioners who come to Sunflower Village will be invited to join in the communal activities,, whether it is preparing meals, cleaning or washing dishes, as a way of learning to cultivate joy and mindfulness whatever we are doing.

Every year, Sunflower Village will welcome thousands of meditation practitioners from all around the world who come to experience the art of mindful communal living, regardless of religious affiliation or their individual faith systems. The Village will also host an annual Summer Retreat which offers special programs for all who attend.

A committee has been established by Dasa for the location of the land in California to make Sunflower Village our home.

ABOUT THE SUNFLOWER ROSARY

The 1st Dasa of the Oikos Intentional Community commissioned the oikourgous (ordered members at Oikos) to begin making Sunflower Rosaries for those belonging to the community and also for the outside world. The Dasa believes prayer beads are a positive meditative tool for focus and contemplation, and developed the Sunflower Rosary for his new monastics.

WHY THE SUNFLOWER?

The Dasa chose the Sunflower for the name of the rosary because the Sunflower means “adoration, loyalty and longevity”. We desire to communicate with God and to draw closer to God because of our adoration of God.  We vow loyalty to God and desire to serve our Master for our length of years.

Gifts of radiant warmth, sunflowers are the happiest of flowers, representing our joy as new monastics. They are unique in their ability to provide energy in the form of nourishment and vibrance, an attribute which mirrors the sun and the energy provided by its heat and light. Our Dasa teaches the importance of spiritual energy, derived from our disciplines in harnessing our emotional and sexual energy for nourishment of the Spirit.

No flower can lift spirits quite like sunflowers can. Bright and cheery, bold yet comfortable, the sunflower is a warm and caring gift. With brilliant yellow petals that surround the flower’s center, sunflowers have an unmistakable sun-like appearance that has made them a passionate flower choice for many. Sunflowers come in a number of varieties, ranging from small to large and from daylight yellows to sunset reds.

Sunflowers originated in the Americas in 1000B.C., where for centuries they were cultivated as a valuable food source. The use of sunflower images as religious symbols has also been documented in some native societies. With the European exploration of the New World, the sunflower was brought to new areas, and the flower’s popularity eventually spread as the rest of the world began to appreciate its beauty and sustenance. Artists throughout history have appreciated the sunflower’s unique splendor, and those of the Impressionist era were especially fixated on the flower. Today, sunflowers continue to provide a resource for commonly used seeds and oil, but they have also become recognized as a floral symbol of great significance.

Much of the meaning of sunflowers stems from its namesake, the sun itself. Wild sunflowers are often photographed with their tall stalks and bright petals stretched towards the sun. This unique behavior, known as phototropism, is a motif that has appeared in many ancient myths and is viewed as a symbol of loyalty and constancy. Their physical resemblance to the sun has also influenced their meanings. The sunflower’s petals have been likened to bright yellow rays of sunshine, which evoke feelings of warmth and happiness. In addition, the sunflower is often associated with adoration and longevity.

For a flower which reflects so many of the sun’s positive characteristics, it is little surprise that people enjoy basking in the sunflower’s warming glow. With the sense of brightness and warmth that sunflowers naturally impart, they have become an ideal choice for sending sentiments of cheerfulness and sunny get well thoughts.

The sunflower is really a collection of 1,000 to 2,000 tiny flowers arranged in an intricate pattern that creates a reproductive opportunity for the plant. This fact represents “community as a whole”. Ray florets are flowers with long, straplike petals along the outside of the sunflower. Each petal on the outside of a sunflower is a flower. Disc florets are the flowers tightly clustered together inside the ray florets. The ray florets are unable to reproduce by themselves because they are missing one or more sex organs. The disc florets possess both male and female reproductive organs. This represents God as both male and female, and how we were created in the image of God with both male and female in each of us.

Perfect and Imperfect

Perfect flowers have male and female reproductive organs, which are the stamen and pistil, respectively. Imperfect flowers are missing one of those organs and, therefore, cannot pollinate themselves. Self-pollination is not necessary for a sunflower plant to reproduce, but it makes it simpler for the plant to accomplish fertilization by wind or insect. A sunflower relies on bees and other insects to help move pollen around its head to each flower. Butterflies and other insects often perch on an upturned sunflower head because its large, flat surface is inviting to insects searching for nectar.

Complete and Incomplete

Complete flowers have all four floral organs. The floral organs consist of sepals, which are small, green, leaflike structures at the base of petals; petals, which are the colorful part of the flower; female sex organs, including the ovary and ovule, which together are called the pistil; and the male sex organs, including the pollen-producing anthers, which together are called the stamen. If a flower is missing any of those parts, it is incomplete but still could be considered perfect. If, for example, a flower is missing sepals but has male and female reproductive organs, it would be a perfect flower; because not all four floral organs are present, however, the flower is also incomplete. Sunflower ray florets are missing both stamen and pistil, making them sterile. Sunflower disc florets are perfect flowers and create fruit when fertilized. That fruit is sunflower seed.

Sunflowers are used for their seeds, meal, oil and foliage as well as for the beneficial properties they provide when grown alongside other crops. The Oikos Intentional Community also grows sunflowers for their seeds and oil.

Health benefits of sunflower seeds

   Delicious, nutty, and crunchy sunflower seeds are widely considered as healthful foods. They are high in energy; 100 g seeds hold about 584 calories. Nonetheless, they are one of the incredible sources of health benefiting nutrients, minerals, antioxidants and vitamins.

   Much of their calories come from fatty acids. The seeds are especially rich in poly-unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid, which constitute more 50% fatty acids in them. They are also good in mono-unsaturated oleic acid that helps lower LDL or “bad cholesterol” and increases HDL or “good-cholesterol” in the blood. Research studies suggest that Mediterranean diet which is rich in monounsaturated fats help to prevent coronary artery disease, and stroke by favoring healthy blood lipid profile.

   Like other nuts, they are also a very good source of proteins with fine quality amino acids such as tryptophan that are essential for growth, especially in children. Just 100 g of seeds provide about 21 g of protein (37% of daily-recommended values).

   In addition, sunflower seeds contain health benefiting poly-phenol compounds such as chlorogenic acid, quinic acid, and caffeic acids. These compounds are natural anti-oxidants, which help remove harmful oxidant molecules from the body. Further, chlorogenic acid helps reduce blood sugar levels by limiting glycogen breakdown in the liver.

   Further, the seeds are indeed a very rich source of vitamin E; contain about 35.17 g per100 g (about 234% of RDA). Vitamin E is a powerful lipid soluble antioxidant, required for maintaining the integrity of cell membrane of mucus membranes and skin by protecting it from harmful oxygen-free radicals.

   Sunflower kernels are one of the finest sources of B-complex group of vitamins. They are very good sources of B-complex vitamins such as niacin, folic acid, thiamin (vitamin B1), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), pantothenic acid, and riboflavin.

   Sunflowers are incredible sources of folic acid. 100 g of kernels contains 227 µg of folic acid,which is about 37% of recommended daily intake. Folic acid is essential for DNA synthesis. When given in anticipant mothers during the peri-conceptional period, it may prevent neural tube defects in the baby.

   Niacin and pyridoxine are other B-complex vitamins found abundantly in the sunflower seeds. About 8.35 mg or 52% of daily-required levels of niacin is provided by just 100 g of seeds. Niacin helps reduce LDL-cholesterol levels in the blood. In addition, it enhances GABA activity inside the brain, which in turn helps reduce anxiety and neurosis.

   The seeds are incredibly rich sources of many essential minerals. Calcium, iron, manganese, zinc, magnesium, selenium, and copper are especially concentrated in sunflower seeds. Many of these minerals play a vital role in bone mineralization, red blood cell production, enzyme secretion, hormone production, as well as in the regulation of cardiac and skeletal muscle activities.

Just a hand full of sunflower kernels a day provides much of the recommended level of phenolic anti-oxidants, minerals, vitamins, and protein.

HOW TO SAY THE SUNFLOWER ROSARY

The Sunflower Rosary is a contemplative prayer form. It is a modern prayer forumula developed by the Dasa, combining the Roman Catholic Rosary with the Orthodox Jesus Prayer Rope. It is comprised of 33 beads (the traditional number of years of Jesus’ life). There is one “INVITATORY” bead followed by four sets of seven beads each (called “stamen”) with a single bead (called the “pistil” bead) in between each Parakaleo. In the Judeo-Christian tradition the number seven is that of spiritual perfection and completion. The circle of beads is prayed, unhurriedly, three times to signify the Holy Trinity. This makes for ninety-nine prayers, and in Middle Eastern traditions, 99 is the complete number of the Divine Names. Rather than a crucifix or a cross, a Sunflower charm or tassel hangs from the beads. If you include the FLOWER at the beginning or the end, this brings the total number of prayers said to 100, which is the total of the Orthodox Rosary and represents the fullness of creation. Typically the saying of the Rosary is followed by a period of silence for reflection.

There are no set prayers for the Sunflower Rosary. It is your choice! You may also use the Dasa’s Prayers from the Salos or develop your own prayers for the stamen section of the rosary.

Listed below is the method of using the beads and some of the more commonly used prayers. Remember, it is the practice that is important, the time spent in communion with God; the rosary is simply the vehicle for getting there. It is a tool for meditation, contemplation and spiritual focus.

HOW TO USE YOUR BEADS

1)         Loosely hold the beads in your hand, grasping the cross in your other hand. If desired, say your opening prayer.

2)         With your thumb and forefinger, grasp the pistil bead and say your chosen pistil prayer.

3)         Move your fingers up the chain to the first of the 4  beads and say your chosen prayer.

4)         Move your fingers up the chain to the first set of stamen  to the right (you will be saying the rosary in a counterclockwise direction). Grasp the first bead and say your chosen prayer for the weeks. Repeat this prayer on the next six beads.

5)         Move your fingers to the next pistil bead and say your chosen pistil prayer.

6)         Continue in this manner until you have completed the circle of the rosary.

THE JOURNEY OF THE DASA

There is a period of time between the choosing of the dasa at the Oikos Intentional Community and his actual investiture. 

When Reverend William Griffith became the 1st Dasa of Oikos, he took his vows, donned nothing but a simple dhoti and began preparing for his investiture through meditation, prayer and service. Chosen March 31, 2015, he shaved his entire body, signed a contract of submission with his prioress and was invested by anointing as the 1st Dasa in an official ceremony April 18, 2015.


In the Oikos Intentional Community, the spiritual leader is known as the DASA (&quot; meaning slave/servant in Sanskrit&quot;).   The dasa is solely dedicated to achieving perpetual spiritual enlightenment ),  through meditation and contemplation. . The dasa wears a simple dhoti as a sign of his poverty. He/she renounces all material goods. Being dasa is open to women; since God is both male and female. The dasa is meant to be an extreme example of servitude and enslavement to the Elohim.



BECOMING DASA


The processes of becoming the dasa were establshed in the Constitution and Bylaws of the Oikos Intentional Community. The rituals following his/her selection include meditation one month prior to the investiture. Before the investiture, the dasa shaves his/her head and body, including his eyebrows, to accent the androgynous character of the Elohim (the masculine/feminine name of God). The dasa must continue this practice as a sign of submission and obedience. It makes the dasa sexless and androgynous. They must also be naturists. The investiture is done with the dasa naked. He/she is anointed with oil and is given the title &quot;The Reverend Dasa&quot;.

Extreme vows are taken for life by the Dasa:

POVERTY

CHASTITY (Celibacy)

OBEDIENCE

SILENCE (For a designated time)


A person who becomesa dasa must seek a pioress or prior before the investiture. There, he or she must sign a contract with the prior/prioress (who serves as physical and spiritual master of the dasa). The prioress/prior is in charge of excercising disciplines to build the extreme vows of the dasa. The dasa is in total submission to the prioress/prior for life and to God. The prioress/prior has earthly authority over the dasa and is charged with keeping him/her in a state of perpetual submission and obedience. This build the character of the dasa's vows.  

Living as the dasa is meant to be a difficult lifestyle. Dasas are considered to be dead unto themselves, and legally dead to the world.

While the life of renunciation is described by the Christ in the gospels, the dasa must live witrh little, including minor portions of food. The dasa must be blessed with knowledge of the esoteric mysteries and use all energy, physical, emotional, mental and sexual energy for spiritual empowerment. The dasa must perform dity and mundane tasks for the community, like douing dishes, scrubbing floors, cleaning the community toilets. These activities, and there are many, are acts of meditation, worship and prayer for the dasa.

The Dasa is to never to be seen as divine, and nothing more than a slave-teacher. What knowledge and insight he/she has is from God. The dasa must routinely wash the feet of the oikourgous (Oikos new monastics) and serve them as slave. The prioress/prior assigns tasks to all of the oikourgous in the community, including the dasa.

The ruggedness of the dasa life deters those who are not enlightened. The practices are rigorous, such as the renouncing of all material goods and a detachment from common luxuries.</description>

      <name>Jesus People USA (JPUSA)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22607&quot;&gt;Jesus People USA (JPUSA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We strive to be Christ's light both in each others' lives and in our community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/jesus-people-usa-jpusa/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/jesus-people-usa-jpusa/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;“I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples.”
― Mother Teresa

In 1972, JPUSA began when a ragtag group of Christians wanted to change the world for Jesus. Now more than forty years later, they are still at it. What started as simply inviting folks in for a meal became a feeding program. What began as a phone call from a mother looking for housing eventually became a shelter, and now a complex of ministries dedicated to housing and resource services. Working together, ordinary people have been able to accomplish extraordinary things.

“Many people are good at talking about what they are doing, but in fact do little. Others do a lot but don’t talk about it; they are the ones who make a community live.”
― Jean Vanier, Community And Growth

In the 21st Century, community makes more sense than ever. By pooling resources, we use fewer resources. We at JPUSA have heard a call from God to reach Chicago’s inner city and beyond with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Perhaps JPUSA’s most important benefit is helping each member grow and mature in the Christian faith through an environment of Christian fellowship, pastoral care, biblical teaching, and practical work either through our tent-making businesses or through our various outreaches to the “least of these.”

“ ‘For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me. . . Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’ ”
― Matthew 25:35, 36, 45</description>

This is an exceptional opportunity to learn and engage alongside our Lakota-trained shaman and natural healing practitioner(s). For guidelines and regitation, please visit our website at www.muaisa.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/muaisa-hale-pule-as-i-aum-sanctuary/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/muaisa-hale-pule-as-i-aum-sanctuary/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;An authorized 501(c)(3) chapter of the New Haven Native American Church (NHNAC), we do not engage in commerce. Instead, we rely on donations and volunteerism for all our services.

At our cedarwood lodge in Kealakekua, Hawaii, we provide several venues of counseling, natural healing, and training for those who seek to renew their energy levels, revitalize their perspectives on life, experience an entirely new state of being, and get in touch with their divine life purpose.

Long- and short-term involvements are available to guests and volunteers interested in personal growth and natural healing, and to those who welcome the opportunity to live in harmony with the island's natural surroundings. This is ideal for anyone who enjoys being of service, is willing to learn about and practice eco-sustainability, and finds joy and fulfillment in personal growth and physical, emotional, mental and spiritual development. 

Situated at 19.5 degrees North latitude in Kealakekua, the general area is located 3 miles (6 miles by car) from the State of Hawaii's #1 marine life sanctuary where pods of dolphins come almost daily to rest, feed, and nurse their calves. The 19.5 North parallel is one of the Earth's 10 major vortices. This place, which the ancients knew  as &quot;The Pathway to the God,&quot; serves as a star gate portal, through which light codes enter the energetic matrix of the Earth to allow prayers and/or intentions made here to be &quot;broadcast&quot; to the world and beyond. 

A 5-star bistro, convenience store, hot tubs, massage therapy, kayak rentals and the bus stop are all within an easy walk. Cafes, banks, 2 post offices, 2 grocery stores and the local Farmer's Market are within a 2-mile stretch. 

Guests, volunteers and residents are likewise invited to help themselves to the abundance of fresh, organic edibles that fall at our footsteps on the property. Depending on the season, we are blessed with an abundance of papayas, bananas, avocados, oranges, guavas, passion fruits, mountain apples and more.</description>

Ever wish you had been part of the Waltons' family? The vision of Kingston House is to be the Waltons' family times three: 20 residents living together as a supportive family of born-again Christians eating together, playing together, studying the Bible together, praying together, laughing together, learning together, and creating a rich and meaningful life together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/nozark-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/nozark-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Can you imagine how awesome it would be to live in a huge house full of your closest friends? Imagine the camaraderie of eating every meal with these friends, the abundance of joyful experiences hanging out with these friends any time you want, the treasure trove of memories your children will create growing up together with their friends, the benefits of raising your children together with your friends, confident that this support network of caring friends is always there to help you watch your children so that you can get your “me” time, and help your children with their homework, and help you work through life’s difficult challenges. Imagine how comforting it would feel knowing that there will always be someone there to greet you when you came home. Imagine the peace and security drifting off to sleep each night assured that there are trusted protectors in the house who will still be there when you wake up each morning. Now imagine being able to live this dream at less cost than you are probably spending now and doing less housework than you are probably doing now, giving you more time, more money, and more energy to enjoy your children and your life. This is the vision I have for Kingston House.

The house is a beautiful, 7000-sqare-foot, fully furnished estate nestled in the majestic Ozark Mountains, with a breath-taking view of the surrounding countryside. It's only a 500-foot walk to the largest lake in Madison County, perfect for swimming and fishing. It’s also a short drive from some of the best hiking, boating, rafting, fishing, caving, nature watching, and other awesome outdoor experiences that the Natural State has to offer, and only an hour and a half from Branson, the Christian entertainment capital of the world.

Kingston House is also conveniently situated in the middle of a well-established Christian neighborhood community, called Living Springs - 21 caring and supportive Christian households, most of whom meet together every Sunday in the neighborhood community building (only 600 feet from the house) for worship, fellowship, and dinner. Can you imagine how cool it would be to live in a house where, not only is each member of the household a born-again Christian, but everyone of your neighbors is also a born-again Christian? At Kingston House, this slice of Heaven is not just a dream, it's an every-day reality.

The goal of Kingston House is not to indoctrinate anyone into any particular lifestyle or belief system, but rather to provide for you a fun, supportive, caring, enjoyable, affordable, and amazingly cool place to live and grow in your own walk with God, and where you are encouraged to develop and exercise your own individual God-given gifts.

If this vision resonates with you, or if you are just curious, I invite you to bring your family to Kingston House for a relaxing and fun-filled visit. I will do my best to make you feel at home, because it is my hope that you will want to call Kingston House your next home. But even if Kingston House is not your next home, at least you will have a uniquely awesome vacation experience that you and your children will be talking about for a lifetime.</description>

      <name>Lydia's House</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22660&quot;&gt;Lydia's House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The mission of Lydia’s House is to provide a supportive and stable environment for women and children in crisis. It is a place of hope and healing as well as a springboard from which guests can seek training, new skills, and work that will provide for their needs. Women live in community, share life and meals with one another, and are encouraged in their personal spiritual journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/lydias-house/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/lydias-house/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Lydia’s House is rooted in the Christian tradition, specifically in the practices of the Catholic Worker movement. While the mission of Lydia’s House is to provide housing and support for women and their children in times of crisis, it is not a housing agency. Rather, the House is a home grounded in the Catholic Worker commitments to personalism, solidarity, faith and community, practiced alongside gospel-prescribed works of mercy.

Unlike some Catholic Worker Houses, Lydia’s House is not a church or host a congregation. However, we hope that this House is holy ground:

A sanctuary for all who come through our doors
A space for meaningful dialogue about the structures and systems that keep the poor poor
A place for prayer and transformation for all, regardless of income, class or culture</description>

      <name>The Lavra</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22662&quot;&gt;The Lavra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Three principles shape the other areas of our existence for which we hope to be an example:

1. SERVICE
Central to nearly all refined philosophies and reflective religions is the call to serve others.  It means considering the skills and natural abilities you have been given and harnessing them to their highest and best use for the good of others.  Serving others is not only a privilege or an option for those who can but an obligation that we all should feel.  It is in serving others that we discover our humanity. 

The service imperative impels us to work tirelessly to, in the words of Karen Armstrong, “alleviate the suffering of our fellow creatures, to dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and put another there, and to honor the inviolable sanctity of every single human being.”  This is a call to compassion that should translate into concrete action.

The scope of service is critical to our vision.  Many people serve their immediate family tirelessly; they sacrifice themselves for their children, occasionally their parents or friends.  While such service is laudable compared to a life lived solely for oneself, our vision for service goes beyond one’s closest circles.  One’s duty to the world does not end with the closest circles of family and friends but begins there.  Serving merely those with whom one has familial or friendship ties does not satisfy the call to sacrificially love others that is critical to most world religions and philosophies.  As a result, the paramount value is found in service to the local, national, and global community.  In fact, one of the most enduring ways to care for those closest to someone is to work tirelessly toward creating a better world for them to inhabit.  Thus, we aim to serve first those in our local community, then our nation, and finally the world as a whole.  We envision a day when the whole planet begins to transform as more and more people expand their circles of responsibility. 

The current social momentum in American society works against service to others on multiple fronts.  At its most callous, the message is often simply that we bear no responsibility to others: everyone is responsible for his/her own success or failure.  In fact, the world rewards those who seek after what they want regardless of its effects on others.  Still other social messages tell us that we have a responsibility to others but only after taking care of our own needs; we cannot give to others until we have learned to discover and indeed love ourselves.  True service to others comes as a result of a secure and overflowing self.  Too often, however, the preparation to service in this vision trumps actual service.  We hold that we should be uncomfortable in our service; authentic love and compassion for others means putting their needs above one’s own.  Our needs can wait, no matter how pressing they may appear.  Our community aims to remind each other relentlessly of this total obligation to serve.  Service is the first of all of our goals and trumps the two below.  If we must choose, we choose to serve first.

Every member of the Lavra takes a commitment to him/herself and each other to work positively for others.  Normally, this commitment will be reflected in one’s occupation but it could also be an attitude that governs one’s life outside of work.  We will encourage, support, and monitor this commitment.  We will exemplify it in our interactions with each other and the friends of the Lavra who visit. 

2. GROWTH
Life is a dynamic process, not a static state.  We are given a set amount of time here to make of it what we can.  We can squander it or continually improve ourselves.  Living at the Lavra means being committed to continual growth in all human dimensions but especially intellectual, emotional, creative, and spiritual dimensions, so that we create a community of inquiry.  The growth imperative does not require a self or the development of an ego—rather it can be seen as growth into a recognition of what is real or into selflessness. The point is that we uphold a community of inquiry and exploration that is supportive to this process.

Diversity of opinion and perspective is critical for growth.  This diversity will be assured by encouraging people of diverse backgrounds, ages, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, intellectual/faith traditions, and other opportunities to provide fresh perspectives.  We plan to support such a lifestyle by holding regular lectures/discussions on religious/social/philosophical topics, and dedicating an area of the property to meditation and worship.

The process of growth addresses the mind, the senses, and our spiritual core.  As we grow as individuals and as a community, we will seek to avoid temptations that often arise with communities, especially hedonistic intellectualism and unreflective hedonism.  Hedonistic intellectualism arises when people gain pleasure from the arguments themselves and thus really are not on a real search grounded in compassion and service for others.  Such environments banter around ideas like a sport, congratulating each other on their erudition and acuity but without much amounting from it.  Intellectualism is critical to growth but it must be placed in the service of humanity.  Discussion has to be motivated by goals that matter for the world, not just oneself.  We all must live uncomfortably for others and if we have been given the gift of some clarity and discernment, this should be employed for others.  Likewise, while the search for sensual and spiritual pleasures are important aspects of growth, they must be reflectively pursued.  Unreflective hedonism is the source of much destruction and harm.  Hedonistic goals are not good in and of themselves but rather find their meaning within a broader intellectual worldview.  An environment conducive to growth thus avoids hedonistic intellectualism and unreflective hedonism.

3. CONSCIENTIOUS, REFLECTIVE, RESPONSIBLE, AND SUSTAINABLE LIVING
This principle is a continual process, rather than a set of rules.  It means reflecting about the choices we make and the impact they have on those around us and the planet.  We don’t place ourselves at the center of decision making processes but the community and the world.  We see this imperative as a sequential process.  We begin by pledging to be conscientious, by which we mean being intimately aware of our own motivations and actions, particularly how they are shaped by our personal histories, social conditions, and immediate surroundings.  When we are conscientious, we do not act by accident or strict impulse but with keen observation of oneself and the world.  Then, we promise to be reflective.  That is, we pledge to consider the impact of our decisions on ourselves, the community, and the world at large.  Finally, we will choose the responsible path that focuses on the good of the community/world rather than our own convenience or personal gain.  It is a process that emphasizes the means rather than the end. This principle is often enacted in our community through dedication to growing and eating local, organic foods (ideally from our own community garden), making our own goat cheese, eating our own eggs, and generally being as tied to the food process as possible. We make vegetarian food for our weekly communal meals, and encourage conscious eating and purchasing of food products. We have also recently moved to solar power for the entire community, and encourage responsible energy use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-lavra/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-lavra/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;In Palestine in the 5th century, there arose a unique form of interdependent living.  It was called The Lavra, an ancient Greek word for a spot where small paths came together in a sort of intersection of souls.  We are attempting to bring this model to the modern world...

Our Community Structure:

We recognize that there is no single recipe for building new ways of living together. Our model for developing a new mode of existence is not for everyone, but we hope to offer a valuable contribution to a network of alternative living environments that provide people options beyond the binary world of single family residences and solo apartments. 

Within the realm of alternative communities, we are trying to navigate the space between:

A commune and co-housing.
A commune typically shares strong ideological commitments, shared financial resources, and usually exists largely isolated and independent from the world around it.  Co-housing usually involves a closer integration to surrounding society, more limited financial pooling, more independent living environments, and less shared commitment to a common religious/spiritual worldview.  While we are supportive of both communes and cohousing, we want to create a middle path that retains much of the integration with surrounding society and independent living environments associated with co-housing, but emphasizes the shared ideology and common purpose of the commune. 
Historically, the full communal life is theoretically appealing but challenging in practice as most communities become increasingly individualistic over time.  We aim to become a mutually-supportive interdependent community that balances the need for personal solitude with the social opportunities and resource optimization that come from communal living. Private space is provided and respected in our community, but “community time” is also allotted and encouraged through activities like shared exercise, movie/lecture nights, common weekly meals, and community chores.

In our lives together, each person will dedicate him/herself to service through their vocation/occupation outside the Lavra; he or she will be integrated into the surrounding world and that world (especially friends/family) are always welcome into our community.  The idea is that we will not be cut off from the world around us but rather serve that world, provide an example of alternative living, and become a sanctuary when respite from that world is needed.

The goal is to create a living environment that balances the need for privacy and solitude within the larger goal of robust community.  The model is to have separate ‘hermitages’ for each unit of the lavra, which can mean a single person, a couple, or a family.  Since people differ in their natural constitution and the stage in their life, there are varying degrees of privacy and isolation.  Some hermitages are separate, stand-alone dwellings with a designated surrounding land that is private and for which the member(s) are solely responsible.  Others live in the main house which is the Lavra Center, though even they have their own entrance and private outside area.  The hermitages are zones of individuality within the larger communal setting.

The remainder of the property is considered common.  The kitchen and living area of the Lavra Center acts as a hub open to all residents and friends of the Lavra.  Eventually, ancillary buildings will be added to the common area, such as a meditation/worship cabin, a mutli-use room for yoga/movie night/public lectures, and a soaking area that will also be common use.  In our desire to be close to natural processes, we also have our version of a farm on our 5 acres of land, with a vegetable garden, vineyard, and an animal area with chickens and milking goats. 

Our interaction with each other is governed by the desires of the group.  The minimal interaction involves a shared communal meal carried on each Sunday night and a work afternoon where we all spend time on chores around the property.  We also have shared ritual life, celebrating the momentous occasions of our lives, the seasonal fluctuations, and the religious holidays that are important to each of us. 

The Lavra also serves as a hub for people who think differently and more humanely about religion in San Luis Obispo County.  Over time, we can develop regular movie nights, lecture series, and possible retreats.  We want to share the Lavra with the world.  We want to be an example to all of a new kind of living that places its value on serving others, spiritual growth, and conscientious living, rather than materialism and ego.  We want to share the value of alternative models of living and real experimentation in solving the pressing problems we face as a society. While we only began this process of development a few years ago and still have a long way to go, we have already developed a reflective, conscious community, and look forward to continuing to grow.</description>

Looking for a group of like-minded mothers interested in sustainable living, alternative lifestyles, shared parenting, spirituality and living in harmony with life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/mother-tribe-in-nyc/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/mother-tribe-in-nyc/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I want to create a community of women in NYC — a space for living, sharing and raising children together. Next spring I will be moving to NYC with my 12-year-old daughter – we have spent the last 5 years in the Indian Himalaya’s working with women and communities and now the universe calls us to something new. Without a plan, we are leaping into the unknown, trusting in the divine and following our hearts. My greatest wish is to connect with other like-minded women — sharing journeys, stories and the tapestry of life as it unfolds together.
I would love to hear from other courageous women who would be interested in co-creating and sharing this journey with us in NYC.</description>

      <name>St. Joseph Farm</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22700&quot;&gt;St. Joseph Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; MISSION
St. Joseph Farm is a Catholic intentional community of young adults striving for holiness within modern society by building our daily lives upon the four gospel cornerstones of prayer, service, simplicity, and community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/st-joseph-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/st-joseph-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;VISION
We will be centered on the Eucharist and open to the Spirit.  We will resist the popular culture as much as it is a “culture of death” and participate in it as much as it is a “culture of life.”  We will respond to the needs of our local community and seek solidarity with the ones we serve as they lead us into a closer relationship with Christ.

With St. Joseph as our patron, we will especially seek to reflect and promote ideas often associated with him:  Just, quiet, chaste, teacher, protector, and carpenter.
•	In being just we will seek to live out Catholic Social Teachings, recognizing the dignity of all human life and creation.
•	In being quiet we will seek simplicity and humility in our actions, for “the fruit of silence is prayer.” 
•	In being chaste we will reject a popular culture of sexual objectification to allow ourselves, with clean hearts, to “see God.” 
•	In being teachers we will provide opportunities to others for spiritual and practical growth.
•	In being protectors we will both seek sustainability as stewards of God’s creation and defend the most vulnerable in society, for “the Church considers matters concerning the environment and its protection intimately linked to the theme of integral human development.” 
•	In being carpenters we will work, often with our hands in the garden or home repair projects, and we will recognize the dignity of human work.</description>

      <name>Biblical Living Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22701&quot;&gt;Biblical Living Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our community focus is to serve God and others. You must be a Christian, or be in the process of accepting Jesus as your Savior. Must be willing to work for the good of the community as well as helping keep the safety of the families in the communities. If you have a criminal background, you must be able to prove that you have turned your life around and have committed yourself to God. Racism, bad attitude, laziness, cockiness, bossiness, ones that cannot or are not willing to be part of a team will NOT be accepted. 

We would be willing to accept polygamist, (husband with several wives), the Bible doesn't say that Polygamy is a sin, however, only Bible-believing polygamist will be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/biblical-living-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/biblical-living-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I am an Ordained Minister; my husband and I have 4 children live in our home, ages 14 to 2.  With our country being very violent, separated, Christians' rights being taken, freedom of speech being taken, our rights to bare arms at risk, laws being put in place that goes against what God teaches us, we have decided to see if we could find like-minded people to start a community. 

Our hopes and dreams are to find Christians who believe that it is time for Christians to start taking measures to prepare for persecution as believers of the Word of God. We in no way are trying to be end-of-the-world preppers, we are simply trying to start a community where Christians can be safe and can have supplies that can sustain us. 

We know that a community like this will take some time to get going, and it will take time to complete. However, we are in construction phase of finding Christians that are just wanting to serve God, but be safe. 

Our hopes are to have the community in a state like TN. Where we can somewhat be on high ground, but yet be able to be in a place that is not in a major city. We are open to suggestions about any part of this future community.

Our vision is for everyone to have their own homes, however, be willing to have gatherings a couple times a week. 

We hope to have either a home-church or have an actual church on or near the property. 

We will ask for church tithes to maintain the church, community, to serve surrounding communities. However, if one is unable to give, we do understand, but we would ask that you give in other ways, such as volunteering for extra work. 

We have not yet decided on if the church would on the community or if it will be up to each family. I would like to see the church own land and each individual put their own homes on the property. However, it really is going to come to how many people will join and where the community will be.</description>

Our current resources enable us to have gatherings year-round. Many people have an ideal notion of Community without ever having hands-on experience to determine if they enjoy the lifestyle. Another obstacle to living Intentionally is the difficulty in forming relations with those who not only share the same values but are committed to living in an Intentional Community. An opportunity thus is provided for individuals and families who are considering Intentional Community, to live in and experience community for a week, a month, a season. Bonds will be formed and a network will be created. Living together on a part-time basis will help to determine where, with whom, and how we want to live together before making a dramatic, life-altering decision to join an IC. In this fashion we will slowly but surely reach a critical mass of people and resources. This network will then begin the process of forming a permanent community in the place of our choosing.</description>

      <name>Theocratic Republic State of the Sword and the Shield</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22718&quot;&gt;Theocratic Republic State of the Sword and the Shield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To provide Christians opportunity to live in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/theocratic-republic-state-of-the-sword-and-the-shield/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/theocratic-republic-state-of-the-sword-and-the-shield/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This is a new micro-nation, at least for the moment, that it is a Christian country.  We are forming a new country based on theocratic republic form of government run by President-Pastor-and King.  The government leadership is hereditary in the family leadership voted approval by residents.  All are direct vote system in politics.

At this present time, we do not have any land or islands.  We are presently working on raising funds to purchase tropical island or &quot;no man's land&quot; or Terra Nullius.

The denomination is none.  Just our own church we call, Church of the Trinity of God and our version of the Knights Templar for men and for the boys, Boy Scouts (not associated with BSA) that we believe true to the Scout's Law and Oath as well as the Knights Oath.

We are quite opposite of United States's direction of politics today such as with what is happening with churches, pastors, bakeries, etc.  We are very Conservative.

To qualify, please notify me for further instruction on how to become citizen of TRSSS and requirements which is very detailed.  

Once secured location, then there will be establishment, new flag, submission to international community to recognize us, etc.

Your involvement will be necessary in daily life in the community with your skills anywhere from farming and family up to government leaderships.

Since this is tropical region, we will have resorts, Olympics quality sporting facilities, and farming (tropical food and seafood).

We will have high tech although some things pretty basic as well.

Prior purchasing, your involvement and citizenship application fees will greatly assist in the process but your own home is at your own expense.  Homes will be based on our own design (President of TRSSS is a Designer and CAD Drafter).  

If room or additional lands, we can consider manufacturing, stores, dealers, etc just like in your hometown.</description>

      <name>Living Miracles Worldwide</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22722&quot;&gt;Living Miracles Worldwide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Miracle of Forgiveness: Enlightenment is experience of What Is, the falling away of the concept of a separate self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/living-miracles-worldwide/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/living-miracles-worldwide/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Living Miracles Community began in 2009 in rural Utah, in the Strawberry River Canyon area. Today the community exists in Kamas and the Strawberry River Canyon, Utah, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Chapala, Mexico.

This group of devoted brothers and sisters live simple devotional lives, hosting retreats, events, and devotional stays and traveling where invited to share gatherings that inspire and bless all who seek peace of mind and enlightenment. They are often referred to as &quot;Messengers of Peace.&quot; Acknowledging that truth is in the Mind, they offer an invitation to engage in the uncovering of the beliefs that seem to obstruct the awareness of love’s presence.

They meet with those who desire to discern between the ego’s thought system and the Holy Spirit’s purpose of forgiveness. The purpose of the gatherings remains unchanged: learning the Spirit’s purpose of forgiveness and awakening to Peace, Happiness, and Freedom.

They serve as mighty companions for each other and recognize that awakening is not a casual endeavor, but one that demands a deliberate and uncompromising commitment. The depth of devotion and faith reflect their willingness to question all assumptions. Total transformation of the mind is approached with passion and devotion and a burning desire from within. This is their unified goal and purpose.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22723&quot;&gt;Ananda Laurelwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Ananda Laurelwood offers the opportunity to live in community with other inspired, like-minded people who share a foundation in universal spiritual principles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/ananda-laurelwood/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/ananda-laurelwood/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Since 1968, Ananda has been a pioneer in small, conscious communities. Beginning with Ananda Village, this pattern of life has spread around the globe, with Ananda communities in Europe and India as well as here in the US. Ananda Portland has had a community in town since 1993, and it serves as a sister to Ananda Center at Laurelwood.  

Building a small community is an art, born of experience, character development, time, commitment and joy. Using the resources at hand, an individual can have direct experience of every aspect of community life at Ananda Laurelwood while also developing the spiritual and character qualities which make for supportive leadership, creative management, dynamic involvement and a richly evolving community life.  Situated in a beautiful pastoral valley, our surrounding farm, gardens, forest and wild-lands provide natural beauty, quiet, and a buffer from the conflicting vibrations of more urban environments. Yet when the world beckons, Portland is just a short drive away.  

Our 55-acre educational campus hosts a Meditation and Yoga Retreat center, a growing organic farm with wwoof opportunities and weekly public volunteer projects, a fully residential internship program, and certification programs in vegetarian cooking and conscious compassion-based eldercare.   Our center is a place of learning and connection, inwardly with the Divine through the practice of meditation and yoga, and then expressed outwardly in our shared activities: vegetarian meals, meditations, service, classes, and recreation.  Students in our residential Cities of Light and Karma Yoga internship programs have a private room with bathrooms just down the hall and three vegetarian meals are served each day. We believe in serving food filled with prana – or life energy. Thus we source organically grown and local ingredients as much as possible.

You can begin your journey in conscious community living by participating in the residential Karma Yoga Internship Program for anywhere from 2 weeks to three months, which integrates spiritual practice, service, personal support, and study of the universal teachings of Self-realization.  Visit our website at http://anandalaurelwood.org/spiritual-internships/ for more information. If at the end of your three-month internship, you’re interested in participating in the long-term Cities of Light residential program, you can apply and interview for acceptance. Costs and fees will be assessed at the time of the interview.  

The long-term Cities of Light residential program is tailored to support those who seek to develop the understanding, the skills and the character that allow for the development of community wherever life might take them.  Some members contribute their time in service to the center while others commute to nearby cities for work. 

On the 175 acres surrounding our campus we are developing an intentional community, what Paramhansa Yogananda called a World Brotherhood Colony, where all of life can be together in one place. We are striving to create a community where the values of simple living and high thinking can be put into practice as an alternative way to live that is more sustainable, and ultimately more fulfilling, where people can find what they truly seek: happiness.</description>

      <name>White Rose Catholic Worker Farm</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22726&quot;&gt;White Rose Catholic Worker Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Following God's path. Care for the poor, sustainability, justice, nonviolence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/white-rose-catholic-worker-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/white-rose-catholic-worker-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;WRCW is committed to faith, hospitality to the homeless, education for social justice, peacemaking/nonviolence, sustainability, and gift economy.  Started in 2009 in the Chicagoland area, the WRCW moved to Northeast Missouri in spring of 2014.  We are part of a larger 160 acre community with our immediate neighbors the Possibility Alliance community and Peace &amp;amp; Permaculture Center. All three communities are dedicated to integral nonviolence (meaning to self, others, earth, institutions, etc.) including striving towards electricity &amp;amp; petroleum-free living, gift economy, communal living, simplicity, etc. We live a simple life on the farm (which we very much enjoy!). We have three buildings on the land: a medium-sized workshop that has 4 season housing on one side and storage on the other, a small 4 season one-room cabin, and a small 3 season cabin.  Planning to build more natural buildings to expand our housing options. 

Life on the farm includes home-cooked meals, composting toilets, hosting those in need, growing vegetables, planting trees, continuing permaculture design, candle-making, chopping wood, hosting college groups, and much more!  Off the farm, we are involved in a variety of social justice causes.

There are plenty of additional opportunities on the 160 acres like classes on permaculture, wild edibles, primitive skills, nonviolent communication, canning/preserving vegetables, natural building, etc. Plenty of self entertainment is available on the 160 acres ... community plays, puppet shows, music jams, birthday parties, sports playing, weekly craft nights, etc. The 160 acres hosts over 1000 visitors a year ... so there are plenty of opportunities to meet people from all over the country and the world doing fascinating things.

The nearest town is La Plata, which is 6 miles away and has a public library and an Amtrak station! So it is easy to get to by mass transportation. We have extra bikes available for use. Kirksville is 14 miles away and is a small college town. There is a good article about the WRCW if you search on the internet for “White Rose Catholic Worker Marquette Magazine”.

The Catholic Worker movement is composed of over 200 communities worldwide of many different faiths (not just Catholic) that are committed to nonviolence, voluntary poverty, prayer, hospitality for the homeless, exiled, hungry, and forsaken, and protest of injustice and violence of all forms.  To learn more about the movement, the best book is probably “Loaves &amp;amp; Fishes” by Dorothy Day (co-founder).

Other skills – One of our partners, the Possibility Alliance, is often working on a variety of interesting projects like straw bale house building, goat &amp;amp; cow milking, hand tool repair, bike maintenance, canning,  spoon carving, fermenting foods, horse care, etc.  There could be opportunities to volunteer with some of these projects on occasion.</description>

The Society promotes the non-dual gate of awakening in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/zen-buddhist-temple-ann-arbor/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/zen-buddhist-temple-ann-arbor/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are a Zen Buddhist Temple that offers residency opportunities. Residency provides support, structure, stability, and community, which help to deepen one’s understanding and experience of the spiritual in daily life. Our structure seeks to establish a viable and nurturing balance between zen training and one’s obligations outside of residency to family, school, and work. In addition to the daily schedule, residents have access to teachers and are able to receive face-to-face formal teachings, and enjoy frequent informal contacts with them. In addition, the $600/month charge includes room, vegetarian meals, utilities, internet access, laundry facilities, and parking.  We honor diversity.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22731&quot;&gt;Sunburst2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our vision is to create an ecologically sound, self-reliant community, combining the latest technological advances in bio-culture and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sunburst-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sunburst-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Sunburst is a community whose ideology revolves around combining alternative-technology education with holistic living. 

We are an interconnected network of allied small groups of people living communally in New Hampshire, USA.

We provide our essential needs for food, shelter, energy, healing, companionship and self-actualization by sustainable growing practices, by harvesting renewable energy for heat, electricity  and mechanical work, by caring for animals, wild and domestic and by sharing life with each other.

We commune with each other with shared meals, dances, optional spirit practices as well as regular meetings and shared work on the grounds.

We generate value for ourselves, for each other and for our neighbors by selling extra food and plant medicine, education, forest products, alternative energy technology , natural healing and other  business ventures.

Our land {Each site} holds a group of private, personal homes, emphasizing small, energy efficient and simple buildings made from local materials, with centralized community space for dinners, music, dancing, lectures and movies. 

Natural healing is accomplished through  the innate healing abilities of our bodies, assisted by practitioners of chiropractic, massage, meridian therapy, herbalism, reiki, counseling and yoga. For our purification, our community has facilities for bathing, swimming, hot water soaks, sauna and sweat lodges.

Food production is  from foraging, gardening, greenhouse hydroponics, aeroponics, aquaculuture, farming, permaculture and agroforestry.

We intend our community to be an exemplary model of responsible living on planet earth, teaching others our culture, on site and on www.

Visitors are encouraged to come and learn, for a few hours, a few days or a few weeks, with several options for exchange of value.

Some of the interests and skills of current community members are solar and wind power, compost heating, filtered rainwater, natural-style parenting, greenhouse farming, homeschooling, music, and worker-owned cooperative businesses.

The community plans to be self-supporting, providing jobs through intense aquaculture, hydroponics, beekeeping, internet business, recumbent-bicycle making, soap making and perfumes. Sunburst is a home for those who share high ideals and who know that tomorrow is built today. We are presently in the formative stages: We now own 140 acres (50 acres of farmland, 48 acres on a lake Lake Wentworth and 42 acres where we are building our home ), located close to each other . (We are joining another community with 42  acres on which to build our buildings and residential housing). 

We want our members to reside in &quot;tiny homes&quot; , members can bring their own or reside in ours. 

 We are building the relationships and the organizational foundations of a community. We are planning on building a cluster of energy-efficient domes and developing a conference and education center which will demonstrate conservation of energy resources and sustainable agriculture.

This coming spring (17) we are purchasing and constructing two large greenhouses, to house our tomato and vegetable crops.  Also will be building/buying two &quot;storage containers&quot; where we will building a barn out of them. 

 We welcome people who have  &quot;tiny homes and/or small homes on trailers&quot; to join us at our community now. We are in the process of purchasing a community building where we will  have meetings and group  dinners.  The community house will include a pro-type aquaculture system utilizing fish and vegetables. Also we plan to  install a underground thermal storage tank for our compost heating system combined with our solar hot water and rocket stove's.  This spring we will be putting up another greenhouse for our hydroponic gardens.  In addition we will be building a &quot;living pond&quot; and constructing two sheds to house  our rabbits and chickens.

Like-minded persons who are ready to develop and explore themselves in a setting of openness and trust are invited to inquire about Sunburst, either as prospective members or as investors in a socially responsible alternative environment</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22738&quot;&gt;Finca de los Hermanos (Jardin del Eden)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Establish the Gospel Jesus Christ proclaimed while being as the living Creator of ALL on earth and live in righteousness side by side, man and His creation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/finca-sukkot/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/finca-sukkot/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We bought this place in accordance to our vision to live a self-substainable plain life in a peaceful and clean environment. 
Our belief is a very simple one. We try to follow the teaching of Jesus Christ. He tells us about the righteousness in His Kingdom, which is not of this world (system) and this is what we desire. In all that we are doing, in all how we are acting, we try to stay righteous. May it be the work on the land or with the animals, righteousness is our benchmark. We are a simple family, live a plain but comfortable life. In order to maintain our expenses like fuel, taxes and so on, we sell part of our crops or products to others, who value pure food.

Farming can be simple, if one considers all aspects of life. However, simple does not mean easy living. In fact, working the soil is hard work, but still it's part of life.
We believe this part of the earth was created in perfection and destroyed only within a few decades due to inconsiderate farming methods.</description>

If you are unfamiliar with it, check out the national website to become familiar with the philosophy: 

www.catholicworker.org/communities/directory.html

At Casa Colibri there are five areas that enrich the community experience:

Children:
Monday, Wednesday and Friday we have 40 kids, ranging from 4-17 years old. First there is an hour of class, and then we serve them a homemade meal. These days the work consists of preparing and cooking the food, teaching or playing with the kids, serving the food, and cleaning the house. 

Sustainability:
Tuesdays and Thursdays consist of a variety of activities around the house, especially working in the garden where we have chickens, compost worms, medicinal herbs, and vegetables. Extra activities include the soap project in which the kids learn how to make soaps from herbs grown in our garden. 

Community Life:
This is a big part of living at Casa Colibri. The house also has many other activities that we do within the community, such as group check-ins, meditations, and excursions to the pueblo and surrounding areas. Every Friday we have a “happy hour” in which we do something fun as a community. 

Community development:
We also work with the community of Hostotipaquillo by giving extra classes and workshops (depending on the number of volunteers and their skills) involving the families of the children as well. We also work to create a culture of art and creativity in the house and with the greater community of Hostotipaquillo.

Spirituality:
This includes a monthly Mass, when friends and the families come to the house to gather, as well as weekly group meditations and discussions. The house is open to people of all spiritualities. 

The day starts with breakfast at 7:30 am, and on average we work about 6-7 hours, including the mid-day meal. The evening time, after 5:00 pm is personal time. Saturday and Sundays are free, with the exception of the monthly community Mass or special events.

Previous experience working with children, farming, and/or living in community is a plus. However these skills are not required, as long as you are open to learning, experiencing new things, and being challenged. Knowledge of basic Spanish is required.

The house asks that you make a minimum 6-month commitment.

In exchange for working with an open and generous heart, one will receive room and board. Extra personal expenses should be covered by the community member.
In addition to community members we also have national and international short term volunteers.

      <name>The Frum Farm - Shaare Shamayim</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22770&quot;&gt;The Frum Farm - Shaare Shamayim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; VISION &amp; VALUES OF SHAARE SHAMAYIM FRUM FARM
 
OUR VISION:
 
To create and live in a rural farm community of Orthodox Jews, that, in spite of our varied backgrounds, fosters harmony with each other, the community at large; and to be good stewards of the land, as we actively live out our Torah values.
 
OUR VALUES:
 
Hashem &amp; Torah first
We strive to be Torah-true, living a life of Kiddush Hashem, to produce a tangible example of the beauty of Torah living.
 
Stewardship &amp; Responsibility
We live gently on the Earth. We are thankful for Hashem's resources He has blessed us with, so we are conscious to take good care of them and use them efficiently. We take personal responsibility to be good stewards with all that we are blessed with. We will preserve the rural agricultural environment and appearance, maintaining open “no build” spaces, and creating a permaculture that is eco-friendly to the rural natural habitat.
 
Cooperation, Honesty &amp; Integrity
Through honesty, understanding, generosity, compassion and integrity, we live cooperatively with one another. When appropriate, we place the interests of the community ahead of our own self-interests, while also valuing our own self-worth.
We recognize our interdependence with all life, and its source. To all that came before us, we offer our respect and remembrance. To all with whom we share this world, we seek mutual understanding and respect. To all who will come after us, we strive to leave a better world. Most of all, we strive to honor Hashem in all that we do.
 
Commitment, Education &amp; Participation
Though we know that the path may be difficult at times, we are committed to our Vision for the long haul.
We seek the exchange of knowledge, skills, and resources with each other and the larger community. We seek to pass this education on to our children, while providing them with a quality education, both secular and religious.
Knowing that our community is fueled by the energy we give it, we all actively participate in community life and work. Each of us gives of his or her energy and skills according to the ability of each.
 
Respect, Kindness &amp; Support
Our farm community supports friendship and an “extended family” environment, thereby creating a sense of belonging for all. We support the growth of each other individually and the relationships amongst us. Each of us is willing to work on our own personal growth so that we can improve those relationships.
We also respect personal privacy and each individual’s choice as to their level of interconnectedness with other community members.
We respect the freedom of each person to live as he/she chooses, so long as that does not interfere with others in the community or run contrary to our stated core Vision and Values.
We value every member, including children, and treat them with kindness and respect.
 
Safety &amp; Balance
In our community, we strive to create an environment of safety - emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually – where all feel welcomed, safe and at home.
Each of us individually, as well as all of us as a community, takes responsibility for our actions, considering how our actions may affect others.
We maintain balance in our community: between Shabbat and the everyday; between group and individual; between building for tomorrow and enjoyment of today; between working hard and having fun; etc., all while seeking to elevate the mundane to holier heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-frum-farm-shaare-shamayim/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-frum-farm-shaare-shamayim/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are the &quot;Alternadox&quot; ;-) seeking to build an Othodox Jewish, but alternative-to-the-city, true, rural community, off-the-grid, with our own sources of power, water and kosher food supply.
A planned community, an “eco-village”, is to be built,  with green state-of-the-art engineering, and including an organic aquaponic greenhouse, with unique, inventive characteristics.  The community will exclusively use alternative power supplies (solar, wind), and will be a co-operative community.
It will include on-site educational facilities, with active outreach toward assisting others in building their own similar projects.
The community will be dedicated to kiruv, warmly welcoming Jews from all backgrounds, be they FFB, balei tshuva or convert; as well as being a safe place for women breaking free of situations of domestic violence. The community will be a place of peace, comfort, happiness and education, where a Jew is a Jew, treated with respect, as they learn to be community builders, and continue on to help others.
We are not seeking to build a commune or a kibbutz, but our vision is more that of an old-fashioned farming community (yet with new-fashioned technology!), where each family has their own home and open space, but where community members help each other and participate as a co-op, for the benefit of all...  a place where we can reap the benefits of a community, but have the freedom of the open country; and where we can truly live by the commandments with joy!</description>

      <name>Shiloh Springs EcoVillage</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22771&quot;&gt;Shiloh Springs EcoVillage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Shiloh Springs EcoVillage seeks to exist as an offering of hope to the world and faith in our Creator that there are better ways to live and work with one another and the Earth than are now commonly practiced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/shiloh-springs-ecovillage/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/shiloh-springs-ecovillage/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Here at Shiloh Springs Ecovillage (Shiloh Springs), our primary goal is focused on quality of life, character development, and spiritual growth within the foundational principles of Messianic Judeo Christian faith with traditional Biblical ethics. We also have some beliefs in Mormonism, however we have no ties to any organized external churches. To that end, we stand apart as an anatomist community, and with that said, we are looking for a core group of initial founders to set the standard of common unity of faith in the Savior of the World, Yeshua, Ha Mashiach. 

We have many goals toward sustainability, on-site electrical power generation, renewable clean-burning fuels, power economy, and eventually power independence, more sustainable agriculture, more effective heating systems and technology, more earth-friendly recycling and waste disposal systems. These things take time, work, and collective minds and energy to bring to fruition. It takes people with sincere desire and strong work ethic to courageously try new things, refine old but proven practices, and to develop and implement new ideas. We believe it takes the synergy of a community of willing people who can think outside of the box and work in this living experiment in social evolution to help find better ways, hopefully becoming a part in a this new human renaissance. We also embrace the wisdom that there is some degree of security in knowing how to live and survive outside of far-removed infrastructures and unstable economies. This kind of sustainability is also the goal of Shiloh Springs EcoVillage. 

At Shiloh Springs we understand that personal and spiritual paths are very individual matters yet we are all part of one another’s paths and experiences. People who gather here should believe that personal and spiritual growth and development are deeply important to every individual. For it is not enough to feed the body, we must also feed the mind and the soul. It is the goal of Shiloh Springs EcoVillage that we encourage each other in this growth. Only in this way can we ever come to understand how to live and work peacefully and effectively with one another, how to solve problems and resolve conflict, and how to become that change we wish to see happen in this world. Therefore we will meet together for practical purposes such as work projects, conflict resolution, and EcoVillage planning and business, for these things are necessary. But we also will encourage the planning of recreation, fellowship, charitable projects, celebrations, and social activities. After all, we are neighbors and brothers/sisters of the Messiah's Gospel. Love and trust come of both working and playing together.

What we cannot offer at Shiloh Springs EcoVillage is a place to hide, from your brethren, yourself, or from the world. If you have criminal problems or a criminal record, social problems such as hostility, violence, addiction, or sexual predation or deviances from Biblical standards, these are not problems that can be resolved nor can they be condoned here. Shiloh Springs EcoVillage has a process for the consideration and admittance, as well as the removal or resignation of members and residents. When considering someone for membership, Shiloh Springs will require a completed written questionnaire we provide and a criminal/sex offender background check for the sake of the security and peace of mind of the entire community. As one of our primary industries is the growth and preparation of food for sale at the local Farmers Markets, member must be able to obtain a Food Handlers License. Having an infectious and or contagious disease many disqualify you from being able to join or live in the community. 

In 2007, after years and years of searching and praying regarding buying land, be were directed to this place here in Colorado. We purchased 70 acres in the county of Montrose, at the edge of the unincorporated town of Redvale. The land at Shiloh Springs EcoVillage is located on the rim of the canyon of Naturita Creek, which crosses the edge of the property some 500 hundred feet below. We are currently in the middle of construction of the community irrigation system. The plans for a micro-hydro plant are currently in development. We would like to build a common house for community gathering and to house facilities that would assist residents and be temporary housing for persons (such as student interns), with laundry and bathroom facilities. We also are looking to eventually integrate aquaponics into the greenhouses, and get a working permiculture-based system going regarding the gardens. This year we have introduction bee hives, vermi-culture (worm farming), and hops to the community. 

The land does hold a mortgage. It is not the intention of Shiloh Springs EcoVillage to give private ownership deeds to entering members or to break up the ownership of the land, but we do intend to place the land into a situation such as a trust, down the road when the mortgage has been satisfied. 

Shiloh Springs EcoVillage will offer short-term and, after a provisional period and member consideration, longer-term lot leases to residents. All members are required to work for the Farm Co-op, as a condition to retaining a lease to live within the community. Our desires are to have an ever-increasing emphasis on internal economy, through non-monetary forms of exchange such as barter, reduced or exchanged housing costs when possible, or paper-accounted trades between stewardships. Starting our own thrift store, herb shop, dry goods hardware, community cow and garden, and other home-craft enterprise is foundational to our success and will be highly encouraged.  

Our intention at Shiloh Springs EcoVillage is to move toward living off the grid, on renewable energy sources, producing fewer greenhouse gases, and living environmentally friendly in more unity with the land. We will seek to build using alternative techniques such as straw bale, hemp concrete bermed earth structures, attached south facing greenhouses, passive radiant heating systems, and passive cooling systems when possible. We encourage the development of additional types of cohousing and cooperatives within the community. We would also like to encourage implementing the use of vehicles owned jointly by the community itself, eventually ones electric powered, or ethanol and bio-diesel powered. We are dedicated to developing the ability of growing most of the foods we consume ourselves or to barter for them first, before outside food is purchased.

We strive to be good stewards of our land, with much of our acreage reserved for limited agriculture, with vineyards and orchards, the pastures and common garden spot. In the river bottoms we will attempt to reintroduce native blackberry plants and medicinal herbs to help revitalize our region's bio-diversity, as well as add to our pasture land. Additionally, we have cut out lots of the dead juniper and winter-kill from our forest and would like to consider the planting of a food forest among the trees. We wish to restock the fish pond on the land as another sustainable community food source. 

Outreach and education is an integral part of our mission, rather than isolating ourselves completely from the mainstream society or others with similar beliefs, we promote Shiloh Springs EcoVillage as a viable alternative to the disconnected rat race that popular society has embraced. Shiloh Springs EcoVillage will have an Altruistic Society for community charitable and outreach projects such as a Gleening Society, local Food Bank projects, and participating in other similar activities. We encourage all members to volunteer their time as they can as these opportunities in brotherhood, service, and good will arise. We enjoy sharing all that G_d has so mercifully and amply blessed us with, with willing hands and hearts. 

If you are interested in Shiloh Springs, please email us and arrange to visit. We also have conditional memberships available for those who would like to come and live with us on a temporary basis, to see if this lifestyle is for them. And though we are not actively seeking new members to share our Community with, we are looking for those core members to actually establish our community with. We acknowledge that this path is not for everyone, our paths may take many twists and turns, and not everyone is destined to put in the effort needed to live this particular lifestyle, but for those drawn to such a lifestyle, please reach out and lets visit.</description>

MISSION STATEMENT - A community holding sacred space, inviting people to experience the spiritual nature of life through action, reflection, and celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/arc-retreat-community-an-ecumenical-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/arc-retreat-community-an-ecumenical-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;ARC (action, reflection, celebration) is an inter-spiritual retreat center operated by a resident intentional community serving individuals and groups seeking time apart, rest and spiritual renewal. ARC is nestled on 90 acres of pristine wetlands and majestic white pine forest an hour north of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. 

ARC's intentional community members offer radical hospitality and hold the sacred space for guests to reflect, renew and heal. Nourish your mind, body and soul with community connections, homemade vegetarian meals and deep conversations with guests. We work hard and join together for the common purpose of serving guests and growing spiritually on our individual paths. 

ARC has a 40 year old log lodge where community members and guests stay in separate wings of the building. We also have a hermitage and a log cottage for guests. Community members are welcome to use the spaces when they are unoccupied. 

The four to nine persons living in intentional community commit to a practice of daily silent meditation, community relationships, personal growth work and managing all elements of the retreat center, as the primary way of living; all community members are volunteers, receive room and board, and a monthly stipend. Our food is cooked from scratch and primarily vegetarian.</description>

So happy to finally get a public posting of our dream community!
First off, let me introduce myself, I AM Niki Lane, Director and Visionary behind this huge endeavor.
Yes, I believe I have lost my mind while at the same time being more sane than i have ever been!  LOL. In the words of MLK, I HAVE A DREAM! And I intend with everything i am to get this ball rolling; someway, somehow it WILL happen!  We are in what I would call the zygote state; we are not even in the embryonic state yet! In fact, It is kinda like the morning after conception! 
So if you are looking for a place that is up and running, a &quot;turn key&quot; step into perfection kind of situation well this is not it, keep moving. This is dirty, messy and so ground floor as to be almost subterranean! 
 We are seeking the most intrepid, energetic and gregarious type of individuals to come be founding pioneer FAMILY members. We need souls that desire to have an intricately involved commitment to a project, who have visions of a more perfect world and who desire with a fire in their bellies to be a strong contributing factor in the creation of something truly GREAT and wholly INSPIRING, with the tenacity to see it thru to the end! (Plus any and all who want to come for a bit and share in the excitement and add their energetic footprint to a worthy cause!)
If you are like me you have seen the dismal state that our beautiful mother Gaia has found herself in because of mankind's greed, unawareness and shortsightedness, and you see that if WE as a species ever want to manage to survive on this AMAZING planet, you see that MAJOR CHANGES MUST occur,,, and SOON!
Now also you must realise that IF we are to ever get the majority of humans on board with the eco-balanced, sustainable and soul-fulfilling lifestyle that will facilitate the continuing survival of our species then you know that we are going to HAVE to take the eco lifestyle to a higher, more sexy and ATTRACTIVE level. This means moving it to a place that the MAINSTREAM population can view it as a truly VIABLE, ACCEPTABLE and DESIRABLE way of life. 
We simply must move our sustainability from the hippy, wonky, and primitive poop-in-a-bucket far left to a more moderate , clean and orderly way of things.
 Think about it, how can we shift all the great things being done in this emerging field into a cohesive, technically advanced, unifying, cyclical, waste-free, planet-protecting, soul-soaringly fulfilling, self-balancing, UNSTOPPABLE revolution? Well, SOMEONE has got to PUT IT all TOGETHER into a VISION that gives life to that possibility!!

So to that end we have a CONCEPTUAL VISION description that paints a picture of what we are ultimately aiming for. This is a living document that grows and changes as we do. AGAIN, this is THE VISION, written in the present tense as if it already exists and is intended to SPEAK it into BEING!
 (Please be aware that this IS NOT what we have at the moment, it is what we are seeking to grow into! )
If after reading it you desire to grow WITH US, then PLEASE contact us for further exploration of your involvement!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22779&quot;&gt;Sky Meadow Retreat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; For people who are disillusioned with the world, have set themselves on a path to wellness, and are looking for meaningful work, a simple home-based lifestyle, and daily support from a small, conscious community to become more present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sky-meadow-retreat/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sky-meadow-retreat/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Seeking Co-managers for Holistic Eco-Retreat Center, Organic Farm, and Conscious Community in Vermont 
Sky Meadow Retreat, a unique sole-proprietor business in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom, is looking for several qualified people to manage the retreat and/or organic farm. You must have experience growing large gardens and permaculture crops for year-round self-sufficiency in a cold climate and/or managing a holistic residential retreat center focused on wellness and personal growth, including digital marketing and outreach. 
The retreat hosts small groups of 10-16 people for retreats of 2 days to 2 weeks, as well as individual and couple's solos focused on personal growth, wellness, and spirituality.  It is located on 120 acres secluded at the end of a road in the small town of Stannard, Vermont on a 150 year old homestead, and has been operating since 1999. The primary building is a large newly renovated barn, and the land surrounding it has been gently landscaped to include swimming ponds, open fields, wooded trails, and a hilltop with expansive views of the Green Mountains. 
In addition to the retreat, Sky Meadow is a working organic homestead growing much of the food for residents and guests, cutting wood for heat and building materials, and maintaining the buildings and land with primary concern for the integrity of nature and health of the environment. We are a truly holistic retreat center in that we source many of our needs from this land using our own labor, keeping us connected to the earth and part of our environment. We believe that connecting with the land in this way is an integral part of healing for ourselves and others.
The retreat is currently managed by a single founder/owner/resident with the help of interns who stay anywhere from several months to several years. We are looking for skilled and experienced people with long-term interest in forming a conscious community supportive of each other’s personal and spiritual growth. It is an ideal situation for someone who is looking for a home-based lifestyle integrated with nature, and a conscious residential community in a beautiful quiet setting. 
You should have some experience with small business, retreat centers, hosting guests and managing interns, as well as rural community living and organic homesteading. Above all you should be dedicated to your own personal growth and awakening, seeking intensive support in the form of intentional community, and passionate about serving the spiritual advancement of humanity. You will be working closely in collaboration with the founder to understand the current vision and systems and how they all work together. 
Compensation for managers includes housing in a beautiful, fully equipped and self-contained private apartment or cabin, access to staple vegetarian foods including all produce grown on the homestead, all utilities including hi-speed internet and phone, and a starting salary of $500/month, or your share of the net proceeds at the end of the year, whichever is greater. In coordination with the daily work required to maintain the retreat and farm, managers will be able to utilize the retreat facilities to lead group retreats and/or offer healing services such as massage or counseling.
This is a lifestyle fully supportive of your personal and spiritual development where there is space, time, and encouragement for self-nurturing and the intention is to use every interaction as an opportunity to become more present and conscious. You will be living and working as part of a small conscious community in a stunning natural setting that offers tranquility and seclusion plus meaningful connections with people and nature. The work is varied, challenging, and fulfilling as it contributes to the well-being of humanity and all of life.  
The Details
Becoming a manager of Sky Meadow Retreat is a full-time occupation requiring you to live and work here. We expect you to make this your primary life focus and fully dedicate yourself to this home-based, homesteading lifestyle. If you have needs which require you to go out or be away more than several times a week, this is not for you. 
Being here is a commitment to a different kind of lifestyle, one that is more whole and integrated, where you work where you live and provide for your own needs as much as possible from the land around you.  To maintain the stillness and integrity of this sanctuary, we ask that you limit your car trips in and out, reduce your internet and phone use, be mindful of your resource use and trash generated, and simplify your life.  If you have debts or financial obligations beyond taking care of your personal day to day needs, this situation will likely not work for you. 
This works best for people who's needs are simple, who enjoy being quiet in nature, are looking for a small intimate community of friends on a similar spiritual path, and want to settle in to a long term sustainable living situation that uses less resources and requires less money.  You will most likely have to change your habits of consumption and simplify your life, exchanging meaningful work and the support of an intimate community for all the variety of entertainment, comforts, and stimulation that many of us have grown accustomed to in our society. 
Here we achieve security by developing presence and learning to let go of the myriad fears generated by an untamed mind.  You will be encouraged to find stability within yourself, in your relationship with your inner source, instead of the accumulation or over-use of resources. Here our entertainment and nourishment comes from working and being with each other in present time, being in nature, and hosting guests who come for healing. 
We structure our weeks with 5 working/community days and two personal/free days, allowing flexibility for circumstances such as longer retreats or homesteading/gardening tasks that require attention outside of these  hours. It is important that all residents and interns structure non-working down time here for personal well-being and maintenance of a relaxed and productive lifestyle. At the same time, as a manager of a business, you should expect to put in extra hours as needed.
The homestead has its own yearly rhythm of work which is most intensified from April – November when we don't have snow on the ground.  The retreat is shut down December – March, and our busy season tends to be May – October.  The winter months offer more relaxed days focused on indoor projects such as building maintenance and office work, including marketing and retreat planning.  This is also a time when long-term residents and managers can arrange longer time away for travel or teaching.
The process of becoming a manager begins with a Conscious Living Internship for at least a month. This initial phase is intended to allow you time to become familiar with Sky Meadow, the way things work now, and the skills which form the foundation for the community, including Insight Meditation and Conscious Communication. No money is exchanged during this period:  you do not pay us to be here, and we do not pay you for your help. This is an initial trial period, which may last several months, in order to discover if we are compatible and can work and live together with each of us getting our needs met.
There is a high degree of structure here compared to some other communities or centers. On working days, we meditate together in silence from 7:00 – 7:30, check-in at 9:00 to set up the day, eat lunch together at noon, and have focused work periods from 9-12 and 2-5.  There is an optional evening mediation from 5-5:30 and we are on our own for breakfasts and dinners.  On personal days you are free to structure your time as you choose. 
Interns commit to work at least 30 hours/week for the retreat and homestead, doing a variety of tasks, many of which require physical labor outdoors.  The work is always varied and can be challenging in ways that build your strength without depleting or injuring yourself. The rest of your time here can be devoted to your personal business such as teaching or healing work, or your personal growth and spiritual nourishment.  We meet as a community one evening a week for a longer personal and confidential check-in, taking care of day to day business, and long-term planning, including scheduling time away or use of the facilities for your own retreat or healing work.  
As a community devoted to personal growth and consciousness we meet at another time each week to focus on Meditation and Conscious Communication. This is an opportunity to get feedback and direction for your practice of meditation and learn and practice the skills of Conscious Communication. We have found that both of these are essential for a healthy and vibrant conscious community, and focusing on them together once a week keeps them fresh and alive, enabling us to better utilize them in daily life.
We ask that you take the time to learn these skills and practice them at Sky Meadow, in addition to any other personal practices you already have. This allows us to share a foundation of tools that enable presence and interrupt the habit of thought that tends to consume and distract us. 
To be a candidate for manager you must already have some proficiency in interpersonal communication, silent sitting meditation, self-awareness, and ability to surrender personal preferences and ideologies. You must be self-motivated, able to assume full responsibility for several “departments” or areas of work at Sky Meadow, be accountable, self-disciplined, efficient, and able to see the big picture while also tending to small details. You will need to be comfortable working in close collaboration and under the supervision of Miles, the retreat founder, to understand the systems and procedures developed here for the past 30 years, before making changes.
You must be able to focus, be present, and learn new skills quickly and efficiently. You will put in a minimum of 40 hours of work per week, and often more, doing what needs to be done while at the same time taking care of your basic needs. You will be eligible for a share of the income from Sky Meadow and may negotiate a monthly stipend until that income is available.  You will also be eligible for one of the larger living spaces such as the Pond House cabin more suited for long-term residency. Managers with long term interests and potential will also have the opportunity to become partners in the retreat center business.

Thus we make room for creativity and personal fulfilment in the context of each individual’s privacy and spiritual freedom. In the way we live together, in the way we care for the land and in the things we make, we intend to uphold the ideals of Camphill, in which each contributes what he or she is able to, and receives in turn what he or she needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/glenora-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/glenora-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Glenora Farm is owned and operated by the Ita Wegman Association of British Columbia for Curative Education and Social Therapy, a non-profit organization and a registered charity with the Canada Revenue Agency.

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22789&quot;&gt;Plowshare Farm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Plowshare Farm is an attempt to be responsive to the social, human, spiritual and ecological challenges of our times by working toward creating an environment where every person and every aspect of the natural world can be learned from and valued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/plowshare-farm/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/plowshare-farm/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Plowshare Farm is a community whose primary task is to serve those in need of special care.  Harmonious to this task come a wide variety of activities which support Plowshare Farm’s striving to be a vessel for the balanced and healthy unfolding of the human being.  How this manifests and the exact nature of our daily tasks are more challenging to describe.

Like a well-functioning farm (one of the things we strive to be) at Plowshare Farm there are many complexities of relationships and inter-weavings.  We are a group of people – coworkers and their families, residents, apprentices, and volunteers who live together in what we call lifesharing homes.  We are a biodynamic farm.  We are bakery, woodwork and candle-making workshops.  We are a vocational training center for people with special needs who join us during the day time.  We are a ‘safe port’ for those who, within their lives’ journeys, need some time in a haven for repair.  We are fertile ground for other initiatives to meet, germinate and grow.  We are a place where the line between caregiver and care receiver is blurred through the understanding that we each have something to learn from the other and that caring for someone or something else is often a very fine path for self-development.

At the heart of these layers is a conscious reaching toward the unfolding of what is truly human in us.  Questions such as: &quot;What am I, in my deepest Self, striving toward?” or &quot;What is my nobler Self and how might I become it?&quot; are questions which all of us, coworkers, residents, apprentices and volunteers, have an opportunity to explore within the structure of our daily lives.  As a community we carry the questions: How can we reach toward a relationship with our natural resources that is sustainable?  How can we participate in bringing about social renewal?  How can we stand as a beacon for conscious, interdependent living?</description>

The following statements represent the specific ways that we are called to bless the world together as a family.
Our Vision (The great need in the world to which we are called):
To live in and for God’s joy as a vibrant family of Jesus so that such communities are cultivated in close reach of everyone.
Our Mission (How our community can meet the need described in our Vision):

    Integrating spiritual growth with work that gets results
    Putting our study and practice into action
    Serving the Dharma and supporting Buddhist practitioners
    Working for the benefit of all beings

This way of studying and practicing the Dharma is a challenging and rewarding adventure. We have accomplished huge amounts for such a small community. We continue to learn new skills and deepen our understanding of the teachings, and we see every day as an opportunity for growth and accomplishment.

Day by day, we are building a model for how a Buddhist community can flourish in the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-nyingma-mandala-training-program/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-nyingma-mandala-training-program/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Tarthang Tulku came to this country because he saw America as a land of opportunity, where he could work to preserve and transmit the teachings that his teachers had passed on to him. He emphasized getting tangible results, with a special focus on preserving sacred texts and creating communities built around Buddhist principles.

Today, his older students are working to pass that vision on to others. Our aim is to create an enduring legacy and a home for the Dharma in the West.

The Mandala Training Program is for individuals inspired by that vision and ready to give their energy to making it happen. When you make that commitment, a dynamic path to inner growth and transformation opens before you.

The Mandala Training Program is a 6-month, residential work-study program that introduces students to our approach to the study and practice of Buddhism and participate in the community’s way of life. Students live and work in our downtown Berkeley Nyingma residential community. We dedicate our efforts full-time toward serving the Dharma and deepening our own understanding.</description>

The Amrit Method incorporates Patanjali’s 8 limbs of yoga in all aspects of life. You will learn how to practically apply the formal practice of asana, pranayama and meditation in your work life and personal life thereby transforming unconscious ego reactions into skillful conscious responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/amrit-yoga-institute/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/amrit-yoga-institute/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Amrit Yoga Institute is nestled in the Ocala National Forest on Lake Kerr, an ideal site for the inward journey of spirituality and conscious awareness.

Seva is a yoga practice that literally means selfless service. Through the various seva programs, The Amrit Yoga Institute offers training in the authentic spiritual teachings of yoga through the Integrative Amrit Methods developed by Gurudev. This is a rare opportunity to study directly from a world-renowned yoga master who is known as a pioneer in bringing the spiritual teachings of yoga from India to the West.

You will learn to return to the present moment where you are integrated and undivided, and what you say, do and feel are in alignment. Washing pots, answering phones, making videos, chopping vegetables and vacuuming rugs will take on new form. In the spirit of selfless service, every sheet folded can be a vehicle of transformation; every pot washed provides an opportunity to move closer to the Source of love by letting go of habituated conditions and judgments.

In addition to your studies with Gurudev, his disciples, and senior teachers, you will live among a community of thirty to forty staff and volunteers. Through the practice of seva, or selfless service, you will have the opportunity to apply your training and practice to work and interpersonal relationships.

Not only will you learn to apply a spiritual lifestyle in all that you do, you will learn a variety of practical skill sets as you rotate through our various departments of operation.</description>

The focus is on using work as an effective spiritual exercise, a practice in mindfulness and the means of perfecting six spiritual qualities, from generosity to discipline and patience, foundation of vigor, concentration, and wisdom. This basic training is called Skillful Means and is based on a book of the same name written by Odiyan founder Tarthang Tulku Rinpoche.  Rinpoche introduced Skillful Means as a way to help readers find greater satisfaction in work and life.

Classes and study opportunities available for all residents in Tibetan yoga, Skilfull Means, classical Tibetan language and other aspects of spiritual community life. 

Resident volunteers who stay on beyond six months also have optional opportunities for engaging in community activities such as daily early morning meditation and other practices of the Buddhist tradition.

Odiyan’s dual mission is preserving the Buddhist cultures of Asia and modeling a living experiment integrating Buddhist principles and Western thought for the benefit of our planet and all of humanity.

Odiyan was founded in 1975 by Tibetan Buddhist Lama Tarthang Tulku. For over 40 years, volunteers from all over the world have been coming to Odiyan for six months or more to develop their own potential and contribute to the unique and holistic vision of enlightened knowledge for the benefit of all.

We will live functionally using the organizational structure of our member-designed rituals and laws. We are not Capitalists, not Communists, not Socialists ... we are an independent form of Separatism. I coined the term &quot;Pagan Separatism,&quot; because the word Pagan really just means unconventional religion. As founder I am a Guru of the this undertaking. Our home will be the Hive and &quot;we&quot; are the Mind. I ask for a strong commitment to the teachings and the lifestyle.</description>

&amp;amp; radiating  inner peace, unconditional love for everyone &amp;amp; self-discipline.

Proposed Household Standards/characteristics (not in any particular order) to  consider:
1) Very Clean &amp;amp; Considerate: ie: never leave a mess in any common area, mindful of every action.
2) Vegan, veggie or some fish consumption only (no dead animal flesh).
3) No alcohol,drugs, tobacco, or animals (dogs/cats, etc). Some experimentation is ok. but not a place
for people struggling with addiction issues.
4) Very Serious about totally eradicating (or have eradicated) gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy &amp;amp; pride. 
5) Frugal energy usage - would rather wear more clothes when it's cold out than turn up the heat, and wear shorts &amp;amp; go around barefooted (eventually when we have free/clean energy, that will be great, but nyet!). Would rather dry your clothes in the sun, on a clothesline, than
put them in the dryer.
6) Very aware of energy  and of the importance of high quality standards in one's living space.
7) Looking for a place for 6 months or more (super flexible lease).

As a starting point, we hope to have a multi-purpose space that can adequately host:

1.	Culturally rich events such as:
             a) 	Story-Night Gatherings. 
             b) 	Theatrical Presentations
             c)	 Musical Performances
2.	Reading/Writing groups
3.	Craft Workshops
4.     Dream Nights

Additionally, we hope the studio space is fit to practice:

4.	Community Gardening
5.	Livestock Farming
6.     Shared art projects and exhibitions

We are very much looking forward to others joining this collective, be it for an event, a weekend for a longer-term stay.

B. Ecovillage life: Possess nothing but own everything

The Ecovllage People will travel freely without border limitations and prefer living the ecovillage life as opposed to traditional lifestyles. There is only one global government, which is managed by saints and sages who no longer think of private profits and possessions.

Meanwhile, people's consciousnesses will grow up, the best qualities of mankind, like sincerity, beauty, kindness, love, faith, diligence, and honesty will be stimulated through collective life, and the weeds in people’s soul gardens, such as selfishness, greed, jealousy, complaining, and laziness will fade away.  Everyone will have and enjoy a harmonious, civilized, happy, and free life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/second-home/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/second-home/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Second Home was established in 2009 in Yunnan, China, by a group of people who held common universal values and the vision of creating a new life mode for human beings to sustain themselves on earth. Yunnan is a region that offers the best weather and rich natural resources in China. We set up three branches and the community members rose from the original 20, up to 180, including 20 older members and 14 children.

Second Home founder, Xue Feng, initiated this project in April 2009. Xue Feng is the spiritual guide of the Second Home, who wrote Chanyuan corpus and Xuefeng corpus since 2001, and have established a theory system on universe, life, LIFE, time and space, human beings, mind, consciousness and energy with over 8,000,000 words. This system combines the essence wisdom and teachings of Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Muhammed, and those of saints and sages from different cultures all over the world. It is a universal-values system beyond races, nationality, culture and religions.

New Universal Values
(It took 15 years to build the theoretical system, still in the process of updating and upgrading)

In our community, we have a harmonious relationship between people and nature. Everyone enjoys a simple and happy life here, the instances of crimes and fights are zero. Arguments, quarrels, and conflicts are very rare.

This is because of the solid basis of the universal values we had built before the community was established. It was initiated and written by the founder, Xuefeng, and since 2001, he has written more than 2500 articles with over 10 million words in Chinese. Before participating in setting up the community, all members are first resonating with the values, including the dream of creating a sustainable new life mode beyond the limits of countries, nationalities, religions, and races; and bringing people real happy, free, joyful, and blessed lives.

So this values system and the common dream are the deep roots and energy source that motivates all members of the Second Home under all circumstances.

The content includes the origin of the universe, the origin of LIFE and human beings, the crises human beings are faced with, the meaning and purpose of life, the nature of countries, political parties, religions, and marriage and family; the consciousness, spirit, thinking, structure, and energy of the non-material world, and the way of perfecting human nature, etc. It absorbs the wonderful wisdoms of human history such as those of Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Muhammad, and all wisdom essences of sages and saints from different civilizations and cultures.</description>

Our community nurtures residents' lives through daily social interaction, shared community responsibilities, spiritual expression, and a balance of communal and private living, in a physical environment of quality homes and extensive common facilities. The members of Berkeley Moshav are deeply inspired by Jewish values and openly express these values in the physical, social, and spiritual dimensions of our intentional community. We are an inclusive community that respects and values diversity in age, family composition, economic circumstance, and Jewish observance.

We intend to create a community of households that are both committed to Jewish life and diverse in Jewish observance. We recognize that this will require compromise and accept that we will all have to go a little beyond our comfort zones in order to create a truly inclusive and Jewishly diverse environment where those who practice and express Judaism differently can make community together.

We welcome equally Jews from all backgrounds as well as non-Jews who wish to live in such a space. (Examples of the latter would include non-Jewish spouses/partners and participants in Jewish life who are neither formally Jewish nor self-identified as Jewish.) We will be a community that honors, respects, appreciates, and values differences in Jewish observance and expression. Jewish practice within each household is entirely at the discretion of that household.</description>

      <name>St John the Compassionate Mission</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22886&quot;&gt;St John the Compassionate Mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The world has lost its sense of the beauty. It has forgotten the beauty and joy of love-- St John's Rule

You have beguiled me with desire, O Christ, and with love divine transformed me-- Orthodox Liturgy

We are a small, Orthodox Christian, community located at 155 Broadview Ave (East Toronto). We are seeking to build a communal life that is structured around the reality of God’s love in the midst of the city. Our life together is marked by the rhythms of prayer, study, liturgy, community life, and a variety of work motivated by a deep respect and love for the poor (our masters, as the early church reminds us). Some of our projects involve running a bakery, thrift store, visitor house, and creating spaces where people can exist without charge and come to discover their own value and mystery. Most recently, we are looking to find ways to be present for folks who are living in very difficult high rises in neighboring Scarborough. We are renting out apartments and attempting to participate more fully in the lives of these neighbors and looking for ways we can offer Xt (love, joy, beauty) into these spaces. All of this work is informed by an overarching attempt to live more deeply and boldly into the intoxicating vision of The Gospel and the Byzantine Liturgy. Though we are committed to the deep value of our tradition, our community includes people from a wide variety of traditions. We have a beautiful mission that is divided into two rooms. One is a place of outreach where dinners are served.  Our life has been deeply influenced by the writings of Jean Vanier, Dorothy Day, and the spirituality of the Little Brothers of Jesus. Applicants need not be orthodox but they would need to be interested in learning about this faith and participating in our liturgical and prayer life. Room and board can be provided. Interested folks should contact Gary at goneil327@gmail.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/st-john-the-compassionate-mission/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/st-john-the-compassionate-mission/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are small group of young adults (mostly in our late 20s and early 30s). The community was founded by a charismatic former Little Brother of Jesus who continues to live on top of the bakery. He is assisted in running the community by another young priest and an older deacon. We are trying to build a substantial lay wing to this community.</description>

      <name>Universalus Intentional Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22887&quot;&gt;Universalus Intentional Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; This group is forming. We wish to be a diverse community of all ages living sustainably with care, consideration and love for all creatures who have evolved on this earth. Next meetup, our 2nd. We wish to establish goals. October 22, 7pm. 2B Oakway Rd, Timonium, Md.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/universalus-intentional-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/universalus-intentional-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This community wishes to establish a community of secular dharma practitioners. Living in harmony and care with individuals of common core values. 
Here is the thesis:
Intentional Community 
Theses of dharma 
•    We are committed to the practice of the dharma.
•    The practice of the dharma consists of four tasks: to embrace suffering, let go of reactivity, behold the ceasing of reactivity and to cultivate an integrated way of life.
•    All persons, irrespective of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability or religion can practice these four tasks. Each person, in each moment, has the potential to be more awake, responsive, and free.
•    The practice of the dharma is more concerned with how one speaks, acts and works in public than how one performs spiritual exercises in private.
•    The community honors the dharma teachings that have been passed down through different traditions while seeking to enact them creatively in ways appropriate to the flourishing of the community at large.
•    The community of practitioners is formed of autonomous persons who mutually support each other in the cultivation of their paths. In this community of like-minded individuals, members respect the equality of all members while honoring the specific knowledge and expertise each person brings.
•    The community and its members are committed to an ethics of care, founded on empathy, compassion, and love for all creatures who have evolved on this earth.
•    The community and its practitioners seek to understand and diminish the roots of violence that are present in themselves and in the society and institutions at large.
•    The community of dharma practitioners aspires to nurture a culture of awakening that finds inspiration in Buddhist and non-Buddhist, religious and secular sources alike.
S.B.; After Buddhism

Just as a farmer irrigates his field, Just as a fletcher fashions an arrow, Just as a carpenter shapes a piece of wood, So the sage tames the self.
Care is the path to the deathless; Carelessness the path to death. The caring do not die; The uncaring are as if already dead.
The sage moves through a village, Just as the bee gathers pollen, And flies off without harming, The flower, its color, or its fragrance. From the Dhammapada

      <name>Psytrance Bisexual community :)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22889&quot;&gt;Psytrance Bisexual community :)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Hi! Do you love psytrance? Are you bisexual?
if you said yes to both questions, then here is a piece of pie for you &amp;lt;3

Why psytrance, you might ask, and why bisexual only, you might also ask, you sillypie with oh so many questions.

I feel psychedelic trance provides the glue that will hold the community together. Psy trance has its own energy code we all know about and love. We can organize parties and why not our very own festival :D
We know if we all love psy-trance, then we probably have much in common, apart from our sexuality. 

Then why bisexual only? Because... because!
Yep, thorough answer to your questions.

Let&amp;#039;s grow together! and shine like buttercups &amp;lt;3

spirituality/shamanism allowed and encouraged. 

:)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/psytrance-bisexual-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/psytrance-bisexual-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ok I will use this to talk about logistics.

I chose Dutch forests, because:
They are in the midsts of beautiful nature, but also close to Amsterdam city.
Not sure if we will live in the actual forest, but at least nearby so we can have awesome walks there and pretend we are hobbits and elves.

We are a short flight away to most European cities like London, Berlin, etc, where the trance scenes are awesome. 
We are in Europe =  Psytrance festival season in the summer wohoooooooooo :E

Now, this community is &quot;Open Source&quot; so, anyone can suggest other alternatives, like, renting instead of buying, living nearer Amsterdam instead of in Veluwe, living in a big house versus living in small private houses, etc.

what else? yes, bring a pillow for pillow fights</description>

      <name>Willow House Christian Intentional Community</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22893&quot;&gt;Willow House Christian Intentional Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Indeed we share expenses and space to ease the economic burden of living. But more importantly, we believe that by living together we will see one another as we really are, which will (we hope) lead us individually and corporately to repentance, forgiveness, grace, and growth as we seek Jesus together.

We are completely on the grid as we are limited by the surrounding infrastructure and fiscally. We do have a wood-burning fireplace and hope for a wood stove at some point.

We don't grow much food on our property, though we grow a little more each year. Alternatively, we seek to support local farmers through CSA's (for produce) and herd share (for raw dairy). One of us runs a natural foods co-op and we get a lot of our food from there too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/willow-house-christian-intentional-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/willow-house-christian-intentional-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We're just a group of normal 20- and 30-somethings living completely on the grid in urban Roanoke, Virginia. We have four bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, a cute little dog, and a lot of love. We might have an extra room for you.

It costs a little bit of money. Unfortunately, we do have bills!

We're college-educated, grow / eat as organically / locally / ethically as we can, read a lot, cook a lot, enjoy good beer and bourbon (if it isn't a stumbling block for someone), and like to talk about things that are meaningful. Most of all, we love, love, love Jesus. That's what this is really about. Fellowship. Iron sharpening iron. Exhortation. Living as biblically as we know how. We go to All Nations Church. We don't care where you go as long as it's biblical and you're committed. That's how this can work.

We have interfaith friends and love people who believe differently than us, but our home is not interfaith; that is not the purpose right now. Consider us your friendly urban Roanoke monastery that affirms secular jobs and marital hanky-panky -- or just a kind of faith-based intentional community.

Our main goal is to educate people how to live mindfully in the Now and with purpose, but also understand at their core that the nature of the Universe is playful and not serious. If you’re dwelling about the future or past, you’re missing what is happening in the current moment, which is all there really is; an “Eternal Now”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/tao-te-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/tao-te-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Ommhome is a tiny nonprofit retreat center and intentional community on the big island of Hawaii dedicated to helping people find a natural and harmonious way of transcending their anxiety and depression, including bipolar disorder, and live a life full of vitality and love. Mindfulness is the key, specifically meditation, yoga, internal arts, diet, communal living and being connected with nature. Our vision is off an off-grid permaculture eco-village with rustic minimalistic structures in the Puna region.

Our belief is that most mental health issues are a result of living in disharmony and that “highly sensitive persons”, usually creative individuals, are far more likely to be pushed over the edge by their enivornment.

The Ommhome mission is to help facilitate positive social change through realization of one’s true nature and harmonious living. Our main goal is to educate people how to live mindfully in the Now and with purpose, but also understand at their core that the nature of the Universe is playful and not serious. If you’re dwelling about the future or past, you’re missing what is happening in the current moment, which is all there really is; an “Eternal Now”.

We are completely donation based, like Vipassana, because we believe in giving without expecting something in return (even Karma), but we do have suggested minimum donation amounts and work hours in order to make sure that we can stay in operation.

Ommhome is meant to be a 501c3 educational nonprofit organization completely funded on the goodwill and generosity of others, and serve as a demonstration of how passionate people can create other organizations like this.

At this stage we are looking for the intrepid individuals who are passionate about this cause and want to put in the hard work to make this center a reality. The community aspect is secondary to the retreat center part, with the idea that the community will grow organically over time.</description>

      <name>Quaker House Residential Community (QHRC)</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22895&quot;&gt;Quaker House Residential Community (QHRC)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Experiment in Quaker community under the care of Ann Arbor Friends Meeting, committed to diversity and inclusivity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/quaker-house-residential-community-qhrc/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/quaker-house-residential-community-qhrc/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;QHRC is a small intentional living community. We share and care for a beautiful six-bedroom, turn-of-the-twentieth-century house in Ann Arbor, close to the University of Michigan's central campus. 

We strive to embody our strong commitments to: multi-cultural/ intergenerational/ racial/ ethnic/ LGBT inclusivity; delicious, healthy meals; simple, economical, and environmentally friendly living; mature, stable, supportive relationships; and open, forthright, and honest communication.

Quaker membership is not required though we respect and uphold the spiritual leadings of the Ann Arbor Friends Meeting (peace, nonviolence, social justice, and respect for all).

Regular evening meals are a central activity of the QHRC. Each housemate cooks for the others a few times a month, and participates in weekly and monthly chores as well as regular house meetings; this participation totals approximately ten hours per week. A monthly financial contribution is required. There is a formal application process.

The first floor of Quaker House is frequently used for community events. The second and third floors are exclusively used by residents. The house is smoke free. Pets are not allowed. At least a one-year commitment preferred. 

Quaker House has had a varied history. From 1955, when Friends purchased it, until 1962, it served as the meetinghouse. For many years it housed an international student cooperative. In 1983, the Meeting discerned that “The purpose of Quaker House is to enrich the life of the Meeting and to carry forward the testimonies, values, and concerns of Friends through outreach to the wider community.” Between 1984 and 1991 Quaker House was home for a refugee family from El Salvador and for a small community of Quakers from the Meeting. Since 1991, Quaker House has been home to the Quaker House Residential Community (QHRC), a cooperative living community under the care of the Meeting. 

This community was originally envisioned by the Ann Arbor Friends Meeting as &quot;a small group of people living in Quaker House and exploring what Quaker community means. We feel that Quaker principles such as seeking the Light, speaking to that of God in every person, living simply, and making decisions by consensus are wonderful underpinnings for creating such a community. The group’s exploration may lead it into spiritual sharing and deepening; new ways of working, struggling, and celebrating with each other; and/or providing each other with support and challenge to reach out to the larger community.&quot;</description>

Each member shares in house chores, working the garden about three hours a week, and communal prayer or meditation at least twice a week. Each member is self-supporting with outside compensated work and contributes toward the household expenses of shared living spaces, private bedroom, garden expenses, utility bills, and other household expenses.</description>

      <name>Eashira Village</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22900&quot;&gt;Eashira Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are an intentional community built around multi-generational households committed to sustainable living and shared resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/eashira-village/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/eashira-village/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;There was a time when multiple generations of families lived together in the same household or the same community for both ease and economy. Over the past few generations this concept has been lost in American culture, and many feel we are worse off for it. Each generation is pushed out of the home they were raised in, to build their life from scratch, shouldering tremendous financial burdens just to replace the family home they left. Children are disconnected from their grandparents and other relations. Parents are often left to carry the load of caring for and raising their family, on their own. 
We understand the need for privacy and independence as generations mature, and our village can provide this without being so disconnected from other generations. Our homes and land are designed and arranged for both private spaces and shared spaces within a household. We even extend the multigenerational concept so that a household contains multiple generations of multiple families. This further enriches the lives of everyone in the community and it allows us to share resources, skills, and experiences.
Our buildings are designed with “aging in place” features to accommodate families in all stages of life. This includes features such as wide doors, ground floor accommodations for mobility impaired family members, grab rails, easy to operate handles, minimal obstructions, and non-slip surfaces. Households have a variety of spaces for everyone from single adults, couples, or larger families, to accommodate everyone as their needs change.  
Having multiple generations of multiple families living in the same community, or even the same household has many advantages:
•	Family members experience the high level of emotional bonding and closeness across generations.
•	Older generations provide important role models in the socialization of children. Younger generations learn how to care for their elders.
•	Spending time with children can bring purpose and meaning to the lives of older generations. For example, the physical demands of keeping up with kids and helping with homework make them feel younger, more useful, and active.
•	Grandparents help grandchildren survive changes in their parent’s domestic structure by giving grandchildren undivided attention and helping when single parents are overwhelmed. 
•	Multigenerational families have financial benefits for everyone involved. If grandparents are in good health and willing, they can help care for young children. Adult children living in the multifamily household can save money while going to school, finding a job or saving money to buy their own shares in the village company.
•	Family members provide constant companionship, as well as help reduce financial strain and stress.
•	Village members look after, help and support each other.
•	Bringing village members together can be a joyful time to treasure and share.
•	While you have the ability for solitary time to yourself, you are never so isolated as to feel lonely or on your own.</description>

      <name>New Oleans Catholic Worker</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22902&quot;&gt;New Oleans Catholic Worker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The Catholic Worker does not have a Mission statement per se. If it did it might be from Matthew 25:35-36. Sometimes known as the corporal works of mercy:
    Feed the hungry,
        Give drink to the thirsty,
            Clothe the naked,
                Care for the ill,
                    Visit the imprisoned,
                        Welcome the stranger.

At St. Thomas House, &quot;welcoming the stranger&quot; means we invite houseless families into our home and all that taking care of a home and the people within it entails: paying for rent, utilities, food, cooking that food, doing lots of dishes and laundry.

​If you value this as well, please help us. We would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/new-oleans-catholic-worker/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/new-oleans-catholic-worker/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;More  on  what  we  do . . .

What we do at the Catholic Worker can be analogous to a 3-legged stool—the 3 legs being Spirituality, Resistance and Community with each leg having not  only action but values and beliefs as well. So what does all that mean?

All are welcome regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion. We are looking to share the rent on an apartment or small house in Norman, depending on how many new members we have. Among our members are Buddhists, Pagans, Christians, and Hindus (and we are open to others!) and we share our spiritual paths with each other.

(tentative statement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/a-watership-down/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/a-watership-down/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;It was something to think about after occupy...

We needed something, anything, so we consensed...then we travelled...then we worked...then we suffered...then we died...because it wasn't actually sustainable...it wasn't even livable...and ultimately it wasn't survivable.

This option removes the encumbrance of land ownership, which arguably is impossible--or at the least incredibly injust--in these united states...

You can be a nomad anywhere.
You can help others anywhere.

Primarily sailboats.
Secondarily water-based living.
Tertiary nomadic lifestyle.

At the center is collaborative shared space, dorm/hostel style. We are quickly acquiring new spaces in order to offer infinite indoor and outdoor living spaces. We are building collaborative relationships in our surrounding community that offer infinite fulfillment for all. We are experiencing ways of being in the world that work for everyone. We are focused on healing, spiritual practice, and being intentional in all aspects of life. We have intentions of offering healing retreats as well as regular collective healing practices for all in the community. We are a block away from an urban farm and market, across the street from a beautiful park, two blocks away from an amazing artistic intentional community, a block away from Atlanta’s beltline (a paved multi-purpose trail that traverses the city and has infinite community building properties), and walkable to an eco-friendly library. The connective and healing potential of our village is infinite. People are contributing in infinite ways, contributing the joy and the gifts that they are. For those contributing financially, it is currently infinitely affordable at 300.00/month. All things are possible. Reach out to us as you feel warmly drawn and explore the beautiful possibilities for collaboration! Thank you!</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22915&quot;&gt;Natale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Establish a sustainable &quot;home&quot; space for those seeking refuge and retreat from the centralized systems of our Planet, where we can re-learn the forgotten self-healing tools within permaculture views, as well as taking responsability for our personal healing, and create new ways of Living peacefully with our environment.

Values
* Sustainability (Emotional, Environmental, Fianancial, Energetic)
* EnJOYment (Find Joy in what we do)
* Nature (Returning back to Nature itself, and Natural ways of Living closer to Nature each time)
* Wisdom from Anscestral Cultures (Rituals, Ceremonies, healing tools, natural medicines, attitudes and lifestyles)
* Education / Ethics / integrity
* Diversity and Intercultural Exchange&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/natale/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/natale/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;After 14 years of patience and persistence, I am closer to being successful in my life vision project. 
Thank you to two of my dearest friends that I am blessed to walk this planet with, I have received a donation of enough money to now go and buy two hectares in the Sierra of Oaxaca, where I always imagined the project to take place. I have done my preliminary work and training over the years and have enough knowledge on the matter and all the right contacts to make it happen as soon as I know which part of the Earth needs me to be her guardian. 
This year is destined for answering to the land’s call and purchasing the right to be on it, develop it with Permaculture design principle and live there peacefully, receiving people in the years to come who are seeking to learn about Natural Building, Community living and who are also looking for a place to retreat to and do personal work.
I am building up a web page with a blog to inform people interested in this project’s development, as well as a donation system, for receiving any additional help people want to provide along the way.
I am currently starting to write a more detailed description on the different phases of the project so to give a clearer idea of the short-, medium- and long-term vision of how I see it in the NOW.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22929&quot;&gt;Grace Changes Everything Ministries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Educate individuals of Spiritual freedom, facilitate small community formation, and directly aid anyone seeking to live from their heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/grace-changes-everything-ministries/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/grace-changes-everything-ministries/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Job Summary

This is a brand new position within Grace Changes Everything Ministries. We have designed a new home-based community model that seeks a community leader to facilitate, develop, and grow its member base. Growth will be measured comprehensively but not least of which, spiritually and financially .

We are not a religion. We are not a church. We are not any sort of organization that aspires to a new set of rules in order to achieve genuine spiritual growth. Titles (pastor), degrees (seminary), and book knowledge (biblical literature) have never genuinely taken the place of relationships, community, and encouragement. We do believe in God and we believe that He/She is divinely and actively working and communicating.

Has this ever been done before?

Some progressive spiritual leaders around the world have created a truer sense of community within their existing religious infrastructure ( Relevant: Faith, Culture, &amp;amp; Intentional Living , Jan-Feb 2018, pps. 068-070). Francis Chan in 2013 notably developed, &quot;We Are Church&quot; out of San Francisco, CA, a home-based affinity group of a church-planting network. However, there is no network currently developing that has stepped away from the church culture without leaving faith, and focused entirely on the spiritual, emotional, psychological, and economical well-being of a small group of 12-15 individuals. There is no non-profit corporation that seeks to develop a network of such communities for the inherent good of its member communities... until now: Grace Life Communities Association .

What qualifies me to be a community leader?

Your life experience, your work experience, and mostly your desire to learn the skill sets needed to start, facilitate, and grow a small, home-based, affinity community within our network. Grace Changes Everything Ministries equips all new prospective community leaders with relevant and comprehensive training. The founder also participates with every new community by way of a 4-6 week teaching experience with his book, &quot;Blinded by Normalcy: What is Life Anyways?&quot;

Is this a job? How do I make money?

This is most definitely a job. You are training to start, facilitate, and develop a small community as part of our network of affinity-based communities. You will ultimately be accountable for the growth of your community in terms of realizing your member's individual goals/dreams. You will be paid based both on the measured growth of your community's portfolio of local fundraising, income generated through individual member's economic activity, and corporate funding projects from Grace Changes Everything Ministries that you participate in securing.

How do I get started or learn more information?

Simply apply through this site. We will schedule a time to meet personally. This opportunity is currently available in Michigan, however expansion efforts are under way for growth regionally and nationally.

We are a family of 4 starting a small community for healers, energy workers, yoga teachers, and organic permaculturists.

Our background is in Kundalini yoga, Tantra, women's empowerment, and conscious relationships. We'd love to find like-minded people to live with in our community (separate housing on the same property) that we are also using as a retreat center and AirBNB.  We'd also like to grow most of our produce.  

Our experiences living in a 60-home co-housing village taught us a lot about what we want. We are looking for like-minded people who are homeowners or who have the funds to be homeowners and would like to join us in making our vision a reality.

Things that are important to us:

--The community will be based on love, peace, and communication.
--Spiritual and yoga-focused
--Shared meals several times a week
--Pet friendly (horses welcome, too!)
--like-minded neighbors, especially energy-workers, yogis, midwives, herbalists, and healers
--eco-friendly homes on one piece of land so that our kids can play together and go from house to house but each family will have their own space.
--organic community garden
--natural parenting
--Limited screen time for children
--Sustainable as much as possible...fruit trees, gardens, etc.
--No animals raised for meat on the property (meat eaters are welcome, just no killing on the land)
--Eco-friendly in as many ways as possible
--Children will be homeschooled, unschooled, or private schooled

Our community will include a Montessori school teacher or someone else who is a good candidate to teach our children to think for themselves and to be curious and explore the world around them, as well as teaching them responsibility and self-care, body-positivity, etc.

UPDATE as of March 2018:  We have land and it's grand!!!  We have a hoophouse, greenhouse, fruit trees, pecan trees, raised beds, and outdoor sheds.  Our family is living on the land in a pre-loved house.  We have horses, dairy goats, chickens, and ducks.

We are currently seeking one individual or family to join us.  Must have organic gardening and/or permaculture skills.  We will add more families in the coming years.  We are open to RV, yurts, tiny houses, medium sized houses...whatever will fit together into our community.  We hope to have a yurt for a classroom and workshop space some day soon!</description>

Although we we are liturgically and theologically an Old Catholic Monastery we are intentional in our commitment to be ecumenical and welcome all Christians within the community.
Our monastery is unique in that it will be integrated in many ways. We will integrate both male and female, celibate and non-celibate, family and single. We will also integrate the various monastic traditions like Franciscan, Benedictine, Trappist, and many others. We will balance contemplative and charismatic, stable (i.e., living in one place) and itinerant (i.e., traveling); solitary and communal; and eremitical and active ministry.

The monastic members will work by farming/gardening, office work, cooking, cleaning, and maintenance of the grounds and buildings. Part of our life will deal with the manual tasks of making the Monastery as self-sufficient as possible to decrease our costs.</description>

We will try to live sustainably and off grid. Health will be of importance here. That being said the following habits are permitted: alcohol, tobacco, cannabis. It will be a community where there are more guidelines than rules. We will participate in activism. We also plan to be a hub for music, art, and poetry where people can learn and teach others also.</description>

Our key principles are to live as close as possible to Nature, and be as sustainable and healthy as possible, to support healing &amp;amp; awakening on every level. ♥mostly raw &amp;amp; organic, strictly vegetarian, gluten-free and no processed/fried/baked foods ♥ no pollutants / toxins on the land or in our bodies, organic permaculture ★ drug, alcohol, marijuana and tobacco-free and we discourage all other forms of addictive behaviour ♥ off-grid, solar electricity with conscious and limited use of Internet and electronic devices ♥ the use of sacred plant medicine in ceremonial context ♫ sacred music sessions ~ singing heart songs ♥ alternative education ☯ a self-sufficient economy from own produce, workshops, events and festivals ∞nomadic &amp;amp; sacred architecture (yurts, domes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/amoraleza/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/amoraleza/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Amoraleza is a community project whose goal is to live in symbiosis with Nature as well as a retreat center, dedicated to plant medicine work, with the intention of providing a safe and sacred space to experience an expansion of the heart and the consciousness.

Russian House #1 is being built around human development and enlightenment goals. We value freedom and friendship and ready for experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/russian-house-1/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/russian-house-1/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Russian House #1 is a community intended for a consciousness exploration and personal growth. It is a free cultural space and an experimental cultural platform. 
As a community we create:

- a frontier restaurant with home-like concept of food-sharing, human communication, participation and sharing;
- a space for cultural exchange (open mics, exhibition, special food days, movies, celebrations);
- experiment in new economics;
- an environment for personal and collective consciousness studies (riddles and puzzles for the public, breathworks, different meditations, mind-development and self-reflection cultivation practices, mindfulness as a path, Game Mastery as priority approach to life-problem solving)

We want to find a way of making things with harmony instead of profit, 
with creativity instead of consumption,
and with friendship instead of client-customer relationship and social rules.


We are intended to become a Post-non-classical science Center, according to classification of Russian philosopher V. Stepin.
Post-non-classical science is something where the researcher includes himself or herself in the research system and obtains knowledge which is not separated from the researcher. The researcher experiences integration of himself or herself into the World. To comprehend on contrary with a classical science, in this case, means to integrate oneself with everything. 

Russian House #1 is located right on the Russian River. People see it as a mysterious place, where the river meets the ocean and miracles happen here often.

Our main focus is the self-exploration and human development.
In order to cultivate it we do:
-	Experience weeks  (weeks of living and experiencing our community life)
-	Russian Games
-	Breathworks (Rebirthing, Holotropic breathwork, Da-breathing, etc.)
-	Intellectual clubs (salon) each Sunday
-	Special events and talks

Our methods can be united with the name of  “breakthrough psychology”.

We welcome everybody for our programs.</description>

See website for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/uoca/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/uoca/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;This is a beautiful boutique yoga health retreat based on the spiritual teachings of the Unification Organisation of Collective Ascension.

There is a large two storey eco-sustainable solar house on 160 acres of secluded forest in Nymboida Australia. Two more huts can be developed and a shed. Up to six people can stay in the house. More in the sheds or camping. More huts and a temple are planned. Those suitable will be assisted to build their own accommodation if they wish to live here.

Members must go through a visitor resident period of at least 3 months. They must follow the diet, vegan, and yoga and meditation practised here and do 4-6 hours work per day.

Perfect for yoga and meditation. In Summer it is naturist. 

All are welcome regardless of race, gender, sexuality, creed, culture, age, disability.</description>

We do not kill any living creature and teach others the act of non-violence (ahimsa). We strive to minimize or cause no harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/peaceful-village-and-intentional-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/peaceful-village-and-intentional-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Peaceful Village is an intentional vegan community and blueprint for creating a peaceful world. Concept started in 2014. We had a temporary land in Belize in 2017 and will reassemble in the near future. Our aim is to create a peaceful vegan community and world and create blueprint for people to create their own communities. If you would like to help with this project in any way please get in touch with us at peacefulvillage@protonmail.com

Mission
At the Peaceful Village, our aim is to create an eco-sustainable community, another way of living, a just and peaceful world through vegan education.

Michael Lanfield
Certified World Peace Diet Facilitator, vegan advocate, and author of five books, including two Amazon best-sellers; The Interconnectedness of Life and The Journey, Michael has garnished 15,000 YouTube subscribers, and 5 million video views and millions more through Facebook, Google+, Instagram, and others. He has written the forward to Mango Wodzak’s newest book The Eden Fruitarian Guidebook.

The basic values for this community include:
 
1.  No being is viewed as property, to be used or harmed in any way, whenever possible. We at the Peaceful Village at Finca Del Soul cherish all life, therefore everyone is vegan while living on or visiting the land. We follow the principle of “ahimsa” or harmlessness where we refrain from injuring any living creature and cause the least harm whenever possible. This includes refraining from the consumption of animal foods and products that contain animal ingredients, as well as, animals used in entertainment, for testing, clothing, or other uses, as much as possible and practicable. We value all animal’s freedom; therefore, we do not participate in the keeping of companion animals “pets” at the Peaceful Village, but rather live harmoniously with naturally free roaming animals in nature.
 
2.  We value every human animal equally and reject all forms of discrimination. We treat everyone as we want to be treated, with kindness, love, and respect.
 
3. Not to take what is not given, but to respect the property of others. At the Peaceful Village, we refrain from taking the property, life, time, or life-energy or others if not given freely directly to us.
 
4. Not to engage in sexual misconduct. This refers to any action of body, speech or mind that sees another as an object for our own self-gratification or against another's free will.
 
5. Not to lie but to speak the truth. We avoid telling falsehoods or exaggerations, internally or externally, through any deceitful action, word or thought, with the intent to harm others.
 
6.  Not to consume alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and cigars. We at the Peaceful Village believe in order to be at peace and harmony, we need not consume any substances that negatively affect the heart or mind.
 
7. We respect nature and avoid using harmful chemicals, minimizing our ecological footprint as much as possible. Therefore, we implement veganic permaculture practices in harmony with the Earth.</description>

We are committed to the gospel principles of prayer, community, recreation, silence, contemplative presence, conversion, and hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/visitation-residents-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/visitation-residents-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;In response to a readiness that we perceive in our hearts and in our lived life, the Sisters of the Visitation Monastery of Minneapolis are seeking to found a Visitation community of the laity alongside the Visitation vowed religious community. Both of these communities are called to minister mutually within the universal church of all believers while living mutually in prayer and community with those less advantaged, embracing and sharing God’s abundance and living Jesus with the joy of being loved by God.

In the spirit of Francis DeSales and Jane DeChantal the Sisters of the Minneapolis Visitation have been oriented toward collaboration with lay groups since the founding of their monastery. Many different endeavors over the years have included: Visitation Neighbors, Visitation Companions, Circle of Leaders, development of leaders in the neighborhood, St. Jane House, Visitation Intern Program, Monastic Immersion Experience and Following the Spirit Discernment Series.</description>

Our 'mother ship' is Canticle Farm, which is comprised of six adjacent houses with fences removed between 36th and Harrington Avenues. Inspired by the life of  Francis of Assisi and the Work That Reconnects as taught by Joanna Macy, Canticle Farm provides a platform for the Great Turning – the planetary shift from an industrial-growth society to a life-sustaining society – one heart, one home, and one block at a time. The Farm manifests a commitment to living and working towards more sustainable alternatives through spiritual practice, integral nonviolence, gift economy, restorative practices, urban permaculture, education and other work necessary for regenerating community in the 21st Century.
The neighborhood is largely Latino. Amor Art Farm and Manantial de Luz (formerly Casa de Paz) are just up the street. Our intention is that as we grow in number, we will house folks through renting/buying houses in the neighborhood.</description>

      <name>Order of Tiamat</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/22998&quot;&gt;Order of Tiamat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; 1. Enable the individual to follow their true will in harmony in an alternative commune that provide them with social and financial support to help them reach this.

True Will is defined as the essential identity, passions, and motivations of an individual once they are stripped of cultural and social conditioning, mind-control, and the modern mindset and necessity to focus on materiality and survival at the cost of everything else.
In exchange for contribution to the development of the Order, individuals will be granted access to some of our resources to use to achieve their higher goals.
​
​2. Function as a sanctuary away from the unsavory aspects of the modern world, while maintaining connection with the more positive aspects so that the fruits of technological and scientific development can be harvested and that we continue to progress forward in all forms of evolution, rather than retreat into previous ways of being.
​
Among other pragmatic aspects of life, we aim at settling all of our willing members together in the same location so they may actualize themselves through social interaction, art,  intellectual work and other collective endeavors.
​​
3. Work to protect and preserve the natural conditions of existence of all living creatures on earth, and to ensure the preservation of the ecosystem for future generations. Contribute to the development of alternative technologies to improve our quality of life, and our knowledge of nature as part of the greater whole.

​4. Evolve as a center for the sacred where the transcendental center of every individual is activated so that all individuals experience the &quot;life that cuts through life&quot;.
​
Many understand the basic modalities of interacting with the world and oneself as feminine and masculine. In other words, they consist of love and will: receptivity to higher realities, and knowledge and skill to mold them. 

Magic practice and the perception of the &quot;sacred&quot; consist of the means, structures, and traditions of apprehending and interacting with a broader range of realities than are generally glimpsed by the uninitiated public. Through it, we can envision Source (the Divine) in its plane of existence, interact with higher dimensional beings in the ethereal plane, and produce thought-forms on the astral plane that will chisel the world around us to reflect our True Will.
​​​
5. Advocate for the rights of the seer, mystic, psychic. Educate the public about the esoteric and its proper place in social life.
​​
6. Create an interdisciplinary center of research for culture. An intellectual salon where important and heretical thinkers are studied with the purpose of achieving greater understanding and capacity for affecting change. A place for the consumption and creation of arts and philosophy that transcend time.

In light of the fragmentation of disciplines in modern academia, we represent an alternative to dissociated hyper-specialization in research. The subjective world, the world of spirit, has been neglected in pursuit of science and technology. The purpose of this center is to merge science, in all its advanced forms, and spirituality, by rigorous research to unravel disciplines that have barely been explored, including Integral Theory, psychoanalysis, and esoteric studies. We want to investigate myths and miracles to see what truly is possible, and to stretch the human to its full potential.
​
The methodology and goal of this center are to merge science and spirituality.
​​​
7. Enact meta-political and trans-historical social change to bring metaphysical revolution based around philosophical principles and a higher form of spiritual action.
​
​8. Restore spiritual sovereignty and ancient knowledge. Study and practice a variety of esoteric, shamanic and occult disciplines in great depth, with a combination of individual and group workings.

We combine witchcraft, shamanism, ceremonial magic, theurgy, neoplatonism, kaballism, Tantra, and other sometimes lost traditions with the goal of helping humanity transcend its limited condition and awareness, and broadening its connection to higher densities. 
​
​​9. Bring people together who've attained transpersonal levels of awareness. Help as many individuals achieve enlightenment/awakening as are ready.
​
The first truly transpersonal stage of awareness is stage 7 in Ken Wilber's terms, where limiting postmodern values such as pluralism, egalitarianism and hyper-individualism are replaced by a structure that favors a more nuanced understanding of self and development of hierarchy. To our knowledge, all existing public spiritual communities in the US are centered around the sixth stage of development or below.​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/order-of-tiamat/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/order-of-tiamat/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Order of Tiamat defines itself as a multidisciplinary spiritual community.
 
We are a growing group of eclectic individuals passionate about spirituality, real politics and exopolitics, holistic science and ancient knowledge, actively involved in both substantial and non-conventional change. We are in the process of creating a residential community which will serve as an alternative to the modern Western world: a crucible disconnected from the burdensome perspective that present-day civilization is heading for collapse and desperately trying to feed us with its own illusions and decadence --individual, social, economic, moral and environmental.
 
Countless alternative social projects like the Order of Tiamat are being spontaneously created and independent communities are emerging right now in many countries. However, our core values and ideals often deeply differ from the mainstream ones one can witness mostly everywhere nowadays.
 
Some of us are artists and thinkers, some seers, some scientists, visionaries or revolutionary activists, some
world travelers. We are looking for genuine, resolute, engaged souls who are willing to commit to a long-term collective project that demands mainly responsibility, insight, strength, relational skills and a fine taste in avant-garde production.
​
We are convinced that individual and isolated acts cannot change the upcoming global crisis the false elite of mankind is working for, and that the main responsibility of those who seek, like us, to embody and preserve what can be saved of earthly humanity's freedom, dignity, knowledge, tradition, and wisdom is to collectively prepare our transition from this age to the next.
​
Today, whenever you examine the different spiritual forces and beings trying to bring their contribution to the enlightenment of mankind, a constant and almost stunning reality appears: nearly all of them are profoundly isolated. If, for instance, you investigate the presence of shamans online and around you, most who are truly knowledgeable and devoted to the spiritual path for its own sake are separated from others pursuing the same goals. Although our enemies are partially responsible for this situation, it is also our own complacency, weakness and lack of faith that distance us from our responsibilities and power in this world.
 
This split results in every single person committed toward enlightenment having to exert an incredible amount of energy for minimal gain; if more unity were achieved, tremendous results could be accomplished almost effortlessly. Society as a whole works collectively with many roles delegated to execute a single purpose; yet those who wish to change the status quo tend to break off from others and to disregard the importance of collective action. humans have many different personality types, talents, and aptitudes, which serves to remind us that even if individuation is a mandatory yet often neglected aspect of spiritual growth, our final cause involves creatively merging with others to be more fulfilled, and successful. 
 
This perspective in mind, one of the central objectives of the Order of Tiamat is to move human cognition to a higher level of non-ego based self-realization fed, stimulated and encouraged in and by the pursuit of wisdom, justice, compassion, truth and constant enlightenment.  On a collective scale, we aim to accomplish this end through subversive inspired art, authentic activism, revolutionary spirituality, and transpersonal expressions of awareness.
 
Our influences, interests, sensibilities and sources of inspiration include both modern culture and ancient civilizations, Traditional forms of spirituality (neoplatonism, shamanism, traditional witchcraft), esoteric thinkers (such as Nietzsche, Evola, Lao Tzu, Plato, Steiner) and the ideals of the Ubermensch, Guardian and Warrior.
 
At this stage, it is still too early to precisely determine where we will establish ourselves, and all viable options - including outside the US - are being carefully considered. This being said, we are currently thinking of spanning a major city and its nearby rural location in either Washington State, Idaho or Montana.</description>

      <name>Nissarana</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/23003&quot;&gt;Nissarana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; A community of lay Buddhist practitioners who are looking to deepen their practice together. While meanwhile living together with nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/nissarana/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/nissarana/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We, in the Western world, live in a way, at least most of us, that is not conducive to practice. We are bombarded with imagery, with false ideals and persuasive marketing. Especially for us beginners it is difficult to remain mindful for a day, let alone remain mindful for a few hours. Times have changed, for better or for worse, but I think it is quite obvious, that we need to reassess our living conditions if we want to deepen our practice.

This has triggered me into thinking about different ways to live, ways which are more conducive for practice. Ways which actually enhance practice. And that is were Nissarana comes in.

TOGETHER ALONE

In my mind Nissarana is community of likeminded people who are willing to practice together, but also at times alone in noble silence. Nissarana will be a community at heart, in which to share and learn, but where there is also space to take time for yourself, to go out for a personal retreat, if that is necessary.

In this modern society there are less and less ways to live, especially if this is 'Religiously' inclined. Of course, nowadays it is still possible for a Buddhist practitioner to go into 'homelessness' by joining a Monastery.

Though there seems nothing 'in between', like a community for lay practitioners. Who are at the start of their spiritual careers, who would like to follow their own path.

Nissarana should not be like a monastery, in the sense that there are strict guidelines. There is practice, but practitioners are solemnly responsible for their own development and in a style in which they would like to practice.

DIFFERENT KINDS OF PRACTICE

Residents form a Sangha, but everybody works individually on their own practices. There is freedom to pursue your own path within the Buddhist framework. There is a common practice, like meditation, discussion and study, but this is really ones own responsibility.

The community and the philosophy is based on that which all Buddhist practitioners have in common, Noble Truths, Eightfold Path, Five Precepts etc. 

One should also be open for different kinds of practice, have respect for different Buddhist approaches, early or late Buddhism. Different Buddhist approaches have developed by interaction with different cultures, one way of practice might work for one person, but might not work for the other. In Nissarana we will look together for the approach that will fit us best. 

REMOTE BUT NOT SECLUDED

An important aspect of Nissarana is an open and compassionate attitude towards other communities at large. If we can start and build this community we are privileged. Therefore we should give back. In whichever way this will be I am not yet sure, this should be discussed together with the future community. But I think the possibility of a personal retreat should be open for everyone.</description>

I envision Sedona Oasis and the surrounding landscape to be a seamless integration of living spaces, event spaces, and nature itself. I see it as an educational forum so others can learn from our collective vision. A place for visitors to enjoy farm to table meals, raw chocolate making, the wines of the area, yoga, meditation, ecstatic dance, and simply connecting with their highest and best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/sedona-oasis-2/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/sedona-oasis-2/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;After being in Sedona for 16 years and owning my own tour company for the last 13 years, I know that Northern Arizona is my home. For this land is purely magical, enchanted in fact. The way the rocks glow at sunset, the people that make up this vibrant community, the sacred waters the flow through Sedona. This town and area have everything that makes my heart sing with joy and gratitude.

For several years I have had a dream. My dream? I wish to start a collective of like-minded souls. Let’s bring our conscious intentions, love, grace, passion, together! For alone I’m just a single man, but with other like-minded souls, we can create something really special. In my vision, it’s called “Sedona Oasis”. It’s a community for the people to live together in harmony. A place where we can grow our own organic food together. Where there is such an abundance of food for not only ourselves, but also a surplus that we can supply the Sedona Foodbank, and offer local restaurants and wineries an organic food sources.

A place where we can build earthen structures to inhabit, living simply, using the materials from Mother Earth whether it be cob, strawbale, hempcrete, adobe, rammed earth, sand bags. A place where we can practice yoga, meditation, community cuddles, and any other forms of self improvement arts freely. A place where we can come together to dance our heart’s dance, sing our soul’s song, simply be. I see gardens and pyramid shaped greenhouses. I see an orchard of grape vines. Yes, I would like to follow in the footsteps of my great grandfather and make wine and also sell grapes to neighboring vineyards. I see an abundance of fruit trees. I see animals: dogs: cats: chickens, goats, ducks, perhaps even a horse. I see a heart-shaped pond on the property with a gentle red rock waterfall flowing through the property. Tucked in-between the trees are pathways to communicate with nature and yourself. I see hammocks, swings, yurts, and hobbit holes throughout the property.

I see a small youth hostel where budget-minded travelers can stay for under $20 a night. I see a small bed and breakfast where other travelers can stay and get to enjoy organic meals made on premises. I see a magnificent kitchen and community area where we can gather. I see an incredible commercial chocolate making the kitchen, where we can host chocolate making gatherings and workshops. I see an opportunity to form a co-op to bring an abundance of superfoods to not only the community but to the public. I have a vision. I have a dream. This vision is so close to coming to fruition: The land is there. 5.6 acres just minutes from west Sedona. there’s a well already present. The property borders national forest and is in an ideal location with views of the red rocks and Oak Creek.</description>

Sharing our skills and experiences, learning from one another, respecting and appreciating our differences, finding our gifts and talents and using them to help the community.
(In a nutshell)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-old-home-place-apiary/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-old-home-place-apiary/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I've been wanting to do something like this for years..not that I don't enjoy healthy solitude and silent time..on the contrary.  And I have amazing friends from all walks of life and fortunate to have family, close.  However, living in the country and trying to  homestead a little here and there and seeing so many amazing projects in prepping, survival, bushcraft, beekeeping, gardening, etc. I've come to the conclusion I need a villiage.  Most are settled in their homes and lives and have no need to travel or seek housing.  They are already living their dream or seriously pursuing it.  But if you're like me, you're still figuring it out.  Last year, my best friend and I started this journey.  He was just going to build me a little chicken coop which turned into a chicken house, then two.  Together, we acquired guineas, a rooster, chickens, and bees.  He loved being the maintenance man, every repair he could make, he did.  We worked side by side steadily from March 2016 until October 2016 when he fell ill.  March 2017 he was diagnosed with cancer.  Though his heart is still in it, he simply cannot continue working, though he probably won't stop.  He has this great airliner camper.  He's going to hang out here and boss me around lol.  I have focused on the bees.  It's the best hobby I could have.  It's good for the soul, along with gardening and any outside work.    I spend a lot of my time reading and learning what I can about bee biology and the art of beekeeping.  This is my 2nd year and I have been so fortunate.  I hope to expand my bee yard even more, next spring.  I've made several splits, sold some, gifted some, kept some.  It looks like I will be going into the winter with 7 hives.  I harvested more honey than I expected and even rendered my first beeswax from all the wax cappings.    We accomplished so much and had plans for so much more, here on the hill.  It's nice and quiet here.  Except for the guineas and a rooster.  There's a creek that runs through the property, a lot of wooded areas, valleys, hills.  I've got one of the best views of the sunrise and sunset.  Seven miles from town, however, you're within an hour drive from Tulsa, Fayetteville, Bentonville, and Eureka Springs.  Many artist and musicians live in the area.  I love my hometown and this is my grandfather's land.  He was an ole timer who loved the simple country life.  It takes years to accomplish all that he did.  But together, we had a modest garden, fresh eggs, and what I thought would be the start of a little homestead.  There are a lot of wooded areas here on the hill and I love the art of bushcrafting.  Not that I'm good at it, but I want to learn many survival skills, along with that. I would love to see someone or group skilled in bushcrafting come and build primitive camping spots, teaching the art.  I'm also looking for individuals who love music and art, love to garden, skilled in herbal medicine, experienced in animal husbandry, butchering,carpentry, homemaking, organizing/starting up small communities, retired beekeepers, active beekeepers, creative and kind people who would enjoy working with others to achieve common goals; safe, clean, peaceful and recreational place to live, clean local food to eat, like-minded people to share in the work and the fruits of our labor.  I think there are a lot of people like me that have come to the realization, &quot;It takes a village.&quot;  I am willing to open my home and share my land with those who are willing to share my vision.  If this sounds like something you're interested in, this may be the &quot;village&quot; you're looking for.  Perhaps you're not experienced or super skilled in these particular areas but you are an amazing person and have something to offer and want to be a part of this kind of community, your gift will make room for you.  One of my closest friends and her 2 are coming at the end of September.  She is going to school for parks and recreation management (or something like that) and this girl can do amazing things with wood.  She's super motivated, organized, and hard-working.  I don't know what this &quot;community&quot; will look like in 6 mos - a year but I'm optimistic about the possibilities.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/23034&quot;&gt;Awakening To Gaia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To live in harmony with all life forms including Gaia and promote the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/awakening-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/awakening-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Here at Awakening Community no life form is intentionally harmed for we are all one.

My expereieces have taught me that we need to honour our unique planet Earth - Gaia for she is far more than we know .  For we are unaware of her true nature and purpose which is in alignment with our evolution and purpose in being 'on earth'.
This is why I started Awakening Community in 2014 and now am opening it to new members. There is so much abundance here - mature walnut, hazel, apple,quince and plum trees all producing. I have recently planted cherry almond peach and apricot and a kiwi and grape vine.  Awakening community is blessed with abundance in the wild - cherry plums,crab apples,cornilean cherry called dryan here in Bulgaria,rosehips, hawthorn berries,. There are also many herbs growing here in the mountains various thymes mints, oregano,lemon balm,chickory,dandylion. 

My book Awakening - The Inevitable Door , to be published early next year discusses and explores the interconnection of ourselves, Gaia  and all life. and shares my experiences  , much more.. 

 My second book Awakening to Gaia reveals our ancient  ability to live a life in co operation and co creation with the spiritual essence of Gaia.  This journey of awakening to our latent dormant abilities is one of remembering and relearning .and weather we are aware or not we have a role and place to for fill in partnership with Gaia .</description>

With this we share a practical and successful alternative life (permaculture) to that of the current consumer system.

We are also part of an International Network of Eco Villages, with which we work for the same ideal. We have Yoga and Meditation Centres, Vegetarian Restaurants permaculture schools and Ecological Parks in more than 25 countries of the world, including two centres in the holiest places of India.

Our international volunteer program is special for those who want to take part in sustainable activities such as permaculture, organic agriculture, afforestation, eco constructions, eco tourism yoga retreats, art conscious, etc. And at the same time experience the contact with nature in an Andean environment, combined with the harmony provided by the practice of Bhakti Yoga.</description>

We provide housing for our coworkers and support them financially depending on their needs. We want to provide everyone with opportunities to be engaged in all the activities of life long learning and to enjoy in the company of others all the cultural events taking place in the course of the year. We believe that a rhythm of work and artistic activity lead to continuing health and awareness of the meaning of life on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-rudolf-steiner-fellowship-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-rudolf-steiner-fellowship-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Founded in 1066 by an anthroposophical doctor and his wife for the purpose of providin an intergenerational therapeutic work-based community centered around the care of the elderly. Our children attend the neighborhood Waldorf School. We have a farm where we raise organic produce, our cows supply milk &amp;amp; yogurt, our workshops help with raising funds. Coworkers are usually either primarily interested in care giving, farming/gardening, or in supportive activities such as cooking, cleaning, maintenance, landscaping, vehicle maintenance, etc. We are very busy and have special laws allowing the elderly to participate at all levels. We welcome volunteers. We offer a farm internship. Families are of course welcome.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/23044&quot;&gt;Star Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; The purpose for this nation is to be a Christian nation founded on Christian beliefs. We are not discriminating against other religions but we know that there are no actual sovereign nations that are for Christians unlike other nations that are based on Islamic beliefs and ideology. So we plan to have a Christian based nation where Christians from all over the world can come and be protected and not be persecuted based off of their beliefs like they are in some parts of the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/star-kingdom/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/star-kingdom/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Star Kingdom is a community that is trying to establish a new nation on the South Pacific islands known as the Kermadec Islands. The form of government is going to be a Parliamentary Monarchy with the founder Austin Rowe as the Monarch and once we get to the islands and establish our homesteads then we will vote on a Parliament. The first settlements will most likely start on the main island which is Raoul Island. Each household will be given several acres of land to build their homes, grow their crops, livestock, and anything else they want to do with their land. The Kermadec Islands are currently under the jurisdiction of New Zealand but the idea is to move to the islands and build our settlements and as long as we don't start any trouble with New Zealand then we should theoretically be okay and eventually claim independence through peaceful means. The islands are situated hundreds of miles away from New Zealand so I doubt they will even notice us there until after we establish ourselves on the island.</description>

We will set up tents, have a garden that we will eat from throughout the weekend, we will have bond fires for the community to spend time together, etcetera. The idea is to eventually get a larger piece of land and build homes on it for our community members to live on a full time basis but for now we are doing more of a trial period at my current residence with tents and such just for all of the people to get to know each other and learn to live and work together for when we decide to move to a more permanent community. The more permanent community will eventually become totally self sufficient with solar panels, farms, a water well, a section of woods for hunting, livestock, and anything else we will need to live completely self sufficient. If you are interested in being apart of this community then please send me an email. Thank you.</description>

There are a variety of residential units, school and university buildings and buildings for hydropondic gardens and dairy, all constructed of fire and earthquake resistant concrete. The buildings are all of the monolithic dome design, which is both energy efficient and the strongest structure known. 

Each residential unit is constructed of concrete with embedded fine mesh metal screen wire to form a Faraday Cage. Inside there is a Satyug Sanctuary Pyramid for each person or couple, and a Goloka Projector for perfect Vastu. There are units to accommodate from one person to entire families.

Each Goloka Sanctuary Community is fully sustainable and self-sufficient - everything for a comfortable lifestyle is included in the community, including organic hydropondic gardens and an ahimsa dairy. Each community has a MahaVideha University Campus and a MahaVideha School, plus a Sri Vyuha Ashram.

Every adult has some light duties to perform for the management, maintenance, and security of the community. The children enjoy the finest education in the MahaVideha School. Every adult is encouraged to attend courses at the MahaVideha University Campus and earn their Doctor of Divinity degree during their stay. Then enjoy life in the Bliss of Krishna Consciousness in the Sri Vyuha Ashram.

Everyone in the community is enrolled in the Satyug Kaya Kalpa Program to create their Satyug Physiology for the coming Krishna Golden Age. Everyone has a Maha Yajña Vitara so the individual and the entire community is Invincible.

These Goloka Sanctuary Communities are our way of surviving the effects of the pralaya so we can thrive in the new Krishna Golden Age. Please read our book that describes this in detail: www.returningtogoloka.com.

is the best way to survive physically and spiritualy the doomsdays ahead and it is the best way to live now.
The last thing you want is to be surrounded by peoples who loose their good values in bad time. 

To prepare a safe heaven for doomsday together and be happy in the process and live a good life with all the ingredients for happiness.

Our technological society have been at the crossroads for a while but at any moment, a global disaster or war to maintain/restore the global order could happen and the supply routes of food might be shut and the chaos in the city will be monstrous. Hopefully the world will cross that cross road peacefully but we are not yet in a safe zone as many dangers are growing and looming. Our goal is to be as far as possible so we can remain unaffected and grow our food or directly harvest it from nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/aeon-doomsdays-heaven/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/aeon-doomsdays-heaven/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Arc Heaven Doomsdays
is a good and fun way to survive in confort the doomsdays maybe ahead while staying positive and confident in our future.
Screening ensure that only humble and respectful peoples with some basic good morals qualities can join.

You can use this e9ma9il also to contact directly but you have to remove the numbers:      
d9o9o9m9s9d9a9y9s9@9t9u9t9a9n9o9t9a9.9c9o9m
However you better sign up for an e9m9a9i9l first at as your e9m9a9il is maybe crappy.
t9u9t9a9n9o9t9a.9c9o9m

Arc Heaven Doomsdays
is not only a safe refuge but a very happy place composed of  peoples who have some awareness of how wicked and fragile our civilization is and the catastrophic risks that lies ahead. A good character with good morals is a minimum to join Arc Doomsdays Heaven and this means that you are not required to believe anything to join Arc Doomsdays Heaven but you are required to follow the leadership which main goal is to make decisions in the best interests of community and the best interests is what makes peoples more happy and how our community can be more prosperous.

Arc Heaven Doomsdays
It is also a good place for those who have a spiritual aspiration to become better a little bit in the way that Christians believe that they have to be good to go to heaven or the eastern faith about avoiding bad karma but our faith is more a loose collection of beliefs based on a variety of traditions (New Age , Yoga , Buddhism , etc.) and scientific discoveries. In anyways you will have plenty of time for silence, prayers and meditation if this is something you enjoy.

Arc Heaven Doomsdays
is about preparing to survive a disaster but at the same time peoples are encourage to enjoy their daily lives and have the peace of mind to know that together we are prepared for most eventualities. 

At Arc Heaven Doomsdays
We are like a family and we take care of all the needs of the peoples in the community. Volontary work within our organization is encouraged (but not not mandatory) and we try to make it fun and rewarding with the various business we own. Some work require contact with the rest of the civilization and therefore we have city bases too for those of us who want to work in the city but around here we are never far of the mountain and the ocean so there is no problem to spend time in the cities.

 We do a lot of activities together such as camping , parties , hiking , electric bicycling,  quad-ding , boating etc.  
Of course one fun activity is to prepare together for Doomsday.

 Like a regular ecovillage we strive to be off grid and use solar power and other devices to bring all the comforts of modern life but we like also our equipment and gears to be portable and lightweight and to have appropriate doomsdays vehicles to move in the case that we need to move.

Part of the money we make is used to buy more equipment for our community.

We have an almost endless free supply of recreational substance such as alcohol (wine and beer making) and (weed cheap and legal) but use of it is not encouraged but it can be available in small and occasional occasions.

There is also ways for an individual to make alot of easy money but you should not join if your main motivation is to make money because money in the hands of the members might be found to be a source of corruption and money might be eliminated at the discretion of the administration who will then keep all the money and use it to share the resources among the members however making money is still possible now.

We stated that we grow 25% of our food however this number could be 100% very easily harvested but it is convenient to buy bulk food for now and we try to have 100% organic food.

We strive to be happy , eat organic food , being close to nature , far from pollution , independent , off grid.
We currently have access to many private lands and we do regular trips to the city for work and or leisure.

At the moment we have a few habitations ready . 

There is no fee to join but more comfort could be purchased.

We have a policy about accepting and equal amount of single man and single women to create a balance and so you could be put on a waiting list until we can accept more peoples but if you have savings that you would like to share or invest then you will be able to bypass the waiting list of course but remember that there is no fee to join. 

Unfortunately the description here is only a pale description of how great Arc doomsdays heaven is but you can trust Arc doomsdays heaven to be greater but some of information must stay occulted for now like our ufo projects :) . After sufficient peoples have joined, we can then make public more plans. At the moment , we are still in the most exciting early stages and ready to take off as soon as a few peoples have joined.</description>

In time as we develop such a community and its attending school, we hope to link with those other schools worldwide who also offer the new teachings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/the-wisdom-retreat-center/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/the-wisdom-retreat-center/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Wisdom Retreat Center is a group attempt for the physical expression of the newer schools for training in psycho-spiritual evolution.

We launch our Wisdom center with the hope to anchor new seeds of archetypal fire and assist in engineering a new renaissance of authentic spiritual living.

Its curriculum will be highly synthetic, drawing on the Wisdom Teachings of many teachers including Alice Bailey, Lucille Cedercrans, Helena Roerich and various others.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/23087&quot;&gt;White Lake Intentional Christian Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We aim to live sustainably (consuming less, sharing items, growing food, living small) together (sharing a property with family units) while honoring Christ (involving community spiritual rhythms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/white-lake-intentional-christian-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/white-lake-intentional-christian-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Inspired by the community living and sustainable practices from our internship and work at A Rocha Canada, a Christian conservation organization, we purchased roughly three acres on land in White Lake, BC, Canada.  This land is 25 minutes away from Salmon Arm affording easy access to amenities, but is unzoned so we are legally capable of building as many dwellings as needed for our community.  What started as raw land in 2017 now has (almost!) three dwelling units in housed in two dwellings. We are currently living in the cabin on site as a family of four and hope that roughly in May 2018 either two family units (a couple, a family, friends living together as family, etc.) or one family unit and some interns will join us.  We are in the process of looking for people to join us who ideally will want to form long-term community with us.  We are very open to people being creative about how to form community on the property.  We have built a showerhouse with a shower, toilet, laundry and fridge/freezer for those who may live onsite in tiny houses without those amenities or for people who may want to come and camp to participate in what's going on here!</description>

      <name>Morganton Fellowship</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/23090&quot;&gt;Morganton Fellowship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Jeremiah 6:16 - &quot;Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/morganton-fellowship/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/morganton-fellowship/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Our names are Ryan and Siobhan Gagliardo.  We are a Christian husband and wife with five young children in search of spiritual fellowship in Morganton, NC.  If we had to define ourselves in denominational terms (which we are not fond of doing!) it would have to be Mennocostal Quaker, which breaks down to:  “Menno” for Mennonite (Menno Simons and the Anabaptists), “Costal” for Pentecostal (Book of Acts), and Quaker (John Woolman).  My wife and girls wear Mennonite dresses and my wife wears a headcovering.  We both became Christians in our teenage years while attending an Assemblies of God church.  We searched the Bible over the years and prayed to God for answers to life's greatest questions.  It has been very hard for us to fit into most churches and to accept the many unbiblical and unnatural lifestyles and traditions that often prevail.  

We share family Bible readings, prayer, and singing together most evenings and Sunday mornings.  We strive to raise our children to be quieter and well behaved, which has been an excruciating challenge, but well worth it thanks to God’s help.   

In application of our faith, we are growing more and more interested in how to live in greater harmony with the natural world that God has given us.  In the past we have raised chickens, ducks, and turkeys for meat and eggs.  We just recently got back into keeping twenty chickens under a tractor coop that we move around the property.  We have experience with keeping a few dairy goats and have learned a lot about the value of rotational pasture grazing for meat and milk.  I (Ryan) have nearly finished a complete reading of Dr. Westin A. Price’s, Nutrition and Physical Degeneration.  It has been a truly epic and life changing read for me that has resonated so deeply with the many reflections I have had about modern life over the years.   

My wife and I purchased a half acre of land in February 2017 with a small mobile home on it.  It is mostly cleared land with plenty of space for gardening.  Last year I took classes in the Asheville area about wild foods and medicine, which has touched upon many aspects of permaculture and sustainable living.  We are heading toward foraging more for our food, which often includes fresh road killed deer and a variety of wild nuts and greens.  There is also a lot of potential for fishing in local streams and lakes.  With help, we could grow a lot more food on our property as well as on a field just walking distance down the road which we have permission to use.  There is also a five acre bottomland plot just behind and adjoining our property which may soon become available to purchase.  

There is a house for sale with several acres just catty corner to our place with a large separate workshop/garage and partly finished upstairs living space.  There should also be a one acre homestead for sale just two houses down from us with a three bedroom house, fruit trees, and an already cleared field where there had been a garden in the past.            

We don’t currently have much additional room in our two bedroom house other than a futon in the school room.  Otherwise, we could park a small camper just next to the house and run a 120V power cord out to it.  We could offer backyard tent/yurt/or other? space surrounded by woods.  It is a quiet neighborhood on a side road which does not get much traffic.  We have neighbors, but enough woods in between that we can hardly see any of them from the backyard.        

We are currently off-grid for water and heat.  We draw water by hand from a shallow well just behind the house.  We haven’t perfected doing laundry by hand, but just recently found a hand wringer that we are about to use.  We are on the verge of transitioning into composting our human waste.  We also have a woodstove that we use for heat and a good amount of cooking.  Our goal is to also do more outdoor wood cooking in dutch ovens as well as a Green Egg grill/smoker.    

We are located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains just 15 min. north of South Mountain State Park in Morganton, NC.  The famous city of Asheville is under an hour away, which we visit often enough.  We love the outdoors and enjoy hiking, canoeing, camping, fishing, and foraging for wild foods.  My wild food class introduced me to several new friends in and around Asheville.   

We crave genuine loving fellowship with other believers or seekers of truth that are open to dialogue about life and faith.  A mutual commitment to life growth will be essential and openness to receive the input of others into the deepest and often most personal and touchy areas of our lives.  We try to be as Spirit-led and sensitive as possible, but real communal life will show us our truest selves very quickly. Our commitment is to utilize that experience to grow and allow God to refine and mature us in every way necessary.      

I have dropped my normal factory (glassblowing) work hours to allow me to take care of home projects and eventually discover a more earth and family-oriented source of income.  I have a few ideas that I am prayerfully exploring.     

Je parle aussi assez bien francais et donc les francophones sont les bienvenus!  J'ai voyage dans plusiers regions de la France et aussi un peu en Cote d'Ivoire.  Ce sont des pays et une langue qui me manque beaucoup.  

Hablo tambien bastante espanol.  Yo vivi algunos meses en Costa Rica y viaje a Nicaragua, Cuba, Guatemala, y Puerto Rico.            

May the Lord richly bless and lead you as you consider sharing fellowship with us!</description>

      <name>Unique Community Name Number 5</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/23097&quot;&gt;Unique Community Name Number 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Sharing and Caring.

Each one, Teach One.

Not relying on systems of oppression.

Being self reliant.

Having FUN!,      .....no for real though, life should be fun.  Hard work can be FUN!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/unique-community-name-number-5/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/unique-community-name-number-5/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;I purchased 40 acres in a rural valley, 4 miles from the shores of Lake Superior.  I helped restart a coop house in Madison, WI.  That inspired me to want to eventually live in an intentional community in the country side. 

 No masters, no leaders, but sharing and caring.  Creating different systems to slowly detach from the &quot;dominat&quot; culture systems most are raised to rely on.


For now, Spring 2018, it is a mostly &quot;raw&quot; piece of land.  Although it has been a farm off and on for 100 years.
Amenities include, a 40ft by 60ft cinder block garage, some animal pens, a driveway, grid electricity, a working well, and 15+ acres of open land, with a slight slope.

Several &quot;old timers&quot; in the area say it is a sweet parcel, and I agree. 

There is also a small creek that runs year round through the southern part of the land.

The southern and western boundaries are public land.  What the owned acres may lack in old big trees, are in the vast, surrounding public forest.  Those trees, County owned, connect to State land, that in turn connect to National forest.  Trees for days!

Some currants, hazelnuts, and chestnuts were planted last year, 2017.  There is also a thriving grape vine, a few black berry patches, and several apple trees sprinkled around.

For now, I am making the payments, getting the garden area going, and growing.  I would like to share it with like minded people.

DIY and DIF. 
I love traditional, primitive skills.  You know, one people did with their hands and minds before the computer space phone came about.  Doing things with friends and loved ones I find to be better then hiring someone to do it for you.  Push your comfort, and you can gain comfort.

Permaculture possibilities are abound, due to the slight and sever slopes the land has.  Potential potential potential.

Organic standards are a pretty good idea.  Following the Iroquois standard of 7 generations seems like a good idea too.</description>

We strive as a community to develop and use sustainable technology and self contained systems for all applications. We have a strong focus on teamwork, consent and non-violent negotiations. We acknowledge and accept all genders and forms of gender expression and sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/solis-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/solis-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Solis Community is a young, forming community comprising of 3 adults in their 30s and 1 child, renting a 4 bedroom house on 6 acres on the outskirts of Perth, Western Australia.
Our goal is to rehabilitate the property which has been heavily farmed and turn it into a permaculture food forest to feed the community. We also have the opportunity to build tiny houses, yurts and tepees and park caravans and campers. We intend to set up external kitchen, bathroom and laundry facilities but those facilities are already available in the house so clean up and planting are the current priorities.
We also intend to fund solar power, water collection systems and a bore pump.
There are 2 rooms still empty in the house and a number of suitable places to park or build a tiny home.</description>

We restore Nature to original beauty by converting a palm oil plantation into a food jungle. We revive an ancient, long forgotten way of life, so that it may lead us into a better, not only sustainable, but regenerative future.
We provide one of many paths to live a happy and healthy life in harmony with Nature.</description>

-An Intentional Jesus Christ Centered Community

 

A place to Grow, a place to Serve, a place to Disciple.

 

“Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!”
‭‭Psalms‬ ‭133:1‬ ‭KJV



What is an Intentional Community?

“A community designed and planned around a social ideal or collective values and interests, often involving shared resources and responsibilities. A group of people living together for specific purpose or reason.” 

A typical Neighborhood is a Community by default. People live in close proximity to each other but do not have a Shared Intention, they just happen to be there. Neighbors may never talk to each other. Neighbors may only see each other when they come in and out of the driveway in their car. It just so happens that neighbors live next to each other. The lack of Common Purpose for being there is something to be overcome. When there is Shared Purpose for why people live in a certain place, then the Community has a solid foundation. 

Where there is an agreed upon Common Purpose for why people are living in a place and they are in Collective Pursuit of the Mission, Intentional Community is found.

 

In our present state of Christianity the majority of people meet for about 2 hours on a sunday coming from other cities/towns, states, and even sometimes countries to come together for a common purpose(worshiping and learning more about God). 

In the early church of Church of Christ, it was not so.
Acts 2:37-47
“Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?

Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. And all that believed were together, and had all things common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.”  

Acts 4:32-37
“And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, And laid them down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need. And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.”

The people of God are Stronger together and are capable of much more when operating in Unity.

Walking As Christ is planning to unite with other Brothers and Sisters in Christ whom are fully devoted to the Lord and acquire a property that is nearly 200 acres in San Diego County California USA, in or around December 2018 establishing the Community of Christians. 

Core Values of The Community 
Local presence and Global Community 
As we pursue Growth in our walk with Jesus Christ, serving the Lord Daily, and Discipling others we will do so collectively from our Local Community as the Headquarters for the work that we do Globally. Physical location in Southern California with Brothers and Sisters in Christ abroad following Jesus Christ and serving the Lord with us.


Embracing Diversity and Empowering Unity 
Followers of Jesus Christ from various backgrounds and denominations living and working together for the greater good of the Body of Christ. The Community of Christians is not to be governed by any denomination or religious institution. The Community will embrace and welcome followers of Jesus Christ from various backgrounds/denominations. 
Whether; Southern Baptist, Reformed, Pentecostal, Orthodox, Catholic, Non-Denominational, or any other Christian group that Preaches/Teaches Jesus Christ and Rebukes sin you are welcome here. This is a mission for all of the called of God around the world. The Mission of this Community is Fulfilling the Will of God and Edifying His people across the Globe.

We plan to share the homeschooling techniques that we use in the Community with all those that desire to homeschool their children in a Christian way around the world.
–Housing Full Time Missionaries 
The Community of Christians will be a Refreshing Station for missionaries around the world.
Missionaries laboring in the name of the Lord from various parts of the world will be able to stay at the Community of Christians for a temporary period in between their missions and be refreshed!

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/23131&quot;&gt;Lifechanyuan International Family Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Our vision:

This earth becomes one big family, where traditional families and countries no longer exist. There will be only one global government and all resources are shared worldwide. Everyone on earth will be able to move freely around the world and there will be no famine, wars or social unrest. The weather are always favorable; no one will pocket anything on the road and no one will need to lock their door at night. Everyone enjoys free, happy, joyous and blessed lives.



Our Mission:

To call on all individuals and groups with insight to transcend traditional family limitations and the consciousness infused by countries, so that they can become global citizens, form an international family, and eventually realize the one world collective ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/lifechanyuan-international-family-society/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/lifechanyuan-international-family-society/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;The Lifechanyuan International Family Society was registered successfully in British Columbia, Canada as an incorporated NPO (non-profit organization) on November 20th, 2017. 

It is located on ten-acres of farmland in Lac La Hache. The property has one wooden house with an established Bed and Breakfast which includes six guest room suites, five bedrooms, four shared toilets, a large dining room, a full kitchen, and a meeting room. The house is facing Lac La Hache lake and Highway 97 passes by it . Water, electricity, gas, and internet are all readily available.

This society will absorb people from different cultures, nations, races, countries and beliefs to form an international family. This international family will adopt the same life mode of the Second Home that Lifechanyuan had successfully created in China. The purpose of this international family is to create a new life model and sustainable future for the humanity.

The crises that people face are becoming increasingly more serious.The main crisis is that the climate change is growing more and more seriously, which causes more and more climate refugees. If this issue cannot be solved effectively, seven billion people will start fighting with each other for survival. This will also make climate change and environment destruction and social instability becoming increasingly severe and eventually lead to humanity’s enormous sufferings. Our objective of founding Lifechanyuan international family is to find a best way to lead humanity into a track of peaceful development before the catastrophic disasters happen. We will do this by assisting the United Nations, governments of all countries, relevant groups and global organizations.

We plan to build the Lifechanyuan international family to a reasonable size of between thirty (30) and three hundred (300) people and will buy more land and build more homes as their need arises.If you are interested in joining us to help create this new life mode and are willing to abide by the third edition of 800 Values for New Era Human Being, you are welcome to contribute financial support or your wisdom to this international family. Let us work toward realizing our most beautiful ideal together.

Welcome people with lofty ideals from all over the world to visit, interview and communicate with us. If you need accommodation and food, please call us in advance to appoint the date.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/23138&quot;&gt;Lotus Community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; We are a community of individuals embodying our divine sovereign nature, honoring the sacredness&amp;amp; the creative 
intelligence within all living being.  We care for our body, our planet ,all species that are alive and we do our 
part to be the example of walking in peace and creating a better healthier world. We stand with awareness and walk 
together as equals. We invite all who are called to remember, know, feel, be, create, share and thrive in our highest 
expression of joy and abundance. We ask that we all bring forth our uniqueness with our gifts, wisdom, experience to 
create this master peace reality. We provide space for healing and creative expression and we encourage experiences 
that support loving relationships, regenerative living, gift economics, 
health and well being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/lotus-community/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/lotus-community/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;We are still in the process of creating the community. 

If you could do anything and monetary system was not involved What would you do? to take care of needs, wants? 

What excites you ?What turns you on ? What are you passionate about ? What motivates, inspires and empowers you ? 

What gifts, wisdom ,experience, skills would you love to share with the world? 



I am we are envisioning a world where we all thrive in abundance. I have spent the last 14 years connecting with others and started many groups all starting with conscious conversation on topics similar to these. 
I am now one of the new co-operating co-owner-member of Lotus Mountain Retreat located in Bolton Valley, Vermont . 
This project is one of a kind. Our intention and Vision here @ Lotus is to be a model for Ubuntu living . 
What does this mean ? For our vision to be shared many videos have been made to inform, empower and inspire others to remember, know, feel, be, create, share, thrive ! 
Here is a video @ https://youtu.be/kM6XjO-pD_Q

We are co-creating a blueprint for a new social structure, a new system, a new reality, without the need for any violence, opposition, resistance, or conflict or the monetary system. All the socio-economic structures of our individual countries have failed us dramatically. It is time to collaborate together to create a better model so that all living beings live in harmony with all living beings. 
Every day we witness a continued assault on our people and the world around us, orchestrated by the global elite who have taken control, of every aspect of our existence. Every single one of us, rich or poor, is born into life-long slavery and bondage from which there is no escape under the current system. Most of us know that the system we are born into does not serve humanity, but very few of us know what to do to change it.

We can no longer sit idly, watching the destruction of our people, our communities, our countries, and our human potential, by greedy corporations supported by governments with no remorse for their actions, or accountability to the people they are supposed to serve. We can no longer sit silently, hoping that someone will do something to stop this assault on our liberties and future prosperity. It has fallen on the shoulders of the common people, to unite and create a new way...a new system...a future filled with abundance and prosperity for ourselves and our children. We are creating a totally new system free from economic slavery... where we turn competition into collaboration... a new social structure where we all benefit from our collective efforts and individual talents... a new world where people are put before profits, and the resources &amp;amp; materials are used to enrich all our lives. 

We Would you like to meet with others who are interested in taking our life , our experience, our consensus reality to another level ?





We look Forward to connecting with you ! 

Namaste, In lakech, ala kin.</description>

      <name>God is true love</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/23139&quot;&gt;God is true love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; Serve God continuously&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/god-is-true-love/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/god-is-true-love/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hello to everyone interested in true love and wisdom that comes only from God. We are a spiritual community that follows the true translation of the bible. We don't have any religion, we just follow the right path that God wants for His creatures. We believe in predestination  and universal salvation. We wait for the coming of God and His right judgment. Until that time we live a simple life in nature, doing what God intends for us to do, farming and eating what we are producing. We don't have insurance of any kind, because we believe that only God is our insurance in everything. We don't need any insurance from people. Our future is in the hands of God, like bible says. It's a sin and a big blasphemy to God to say that we believe in Him but we go to men and ask from them insurance for the future. In consequence we don't work for men because the insurance is obligatory. We work our land given to us by God. He is merciful with us and gives us rain and we have what to eat. In this country the insurance for house is not obligatory, and the taxes for land and house are still low. This area where we live is peaceful because God protects us. It is written that if we serve Him we will have everything we need in order to survive here and be happy. I suppose many have such a dream and we can say it is possible, but only with God. We expect to hear from brothers and sisters interested in this way of living. You are welcome.</description>

      <name>Śiva Ashram</name>
      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/23150&quot;&gt;Śiva Ashram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; - Provide a quiet space away from busy modern life to allow for spiritual unfoldment. 
- To develop a strong spiritual center for Saivism in eastern canada where it is possible tolive the most traditional monastic/ashram lifestyle possible. 
- To make the teachings of Saiva Siddhantha available to those it might benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/siva-ashram/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/siva-ashram/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Śiva Ashram is made up of a group of yoga enthusiasts living in the woods sharing daily spiritual practices and karma yoga / work in the accommodation business that sustains our community. 

Our site include a house with 3 rooms, two tiny houses fitting two people each and a trailer home. We share common areas of the house (kitchen, dining, living room and meditation room) outdoor jacuzzi.

We focus on living a contemplative lifestyle with simple tasks and clearly defined time blocks to allow time for contemplation and meditation throughout the day. Our group's spiritual unfoldment is stimulated and guided by hindu philosophy, meditation, devotional practices, hatha yoga, scripture study, vedic chanting and mantra singing. 

Religious/philosophical lineage :
Śiva stands for Shiva, which refers to the God most would otherwise call &quot;the universe&quot;, which to us is omnipresent love and transcendent reality. We follow and study Saiva Siddhantha which is a traditional mystical branch of hinduism from south india and northern Sri Lanka that sees Śiva as the ultimate God. We believe all souls are divine, and we strive to see God in all and everything as well as within ourselves. We also believe that one of life's most important goal is the realization of the self God within us, self-realisation, the experience of parasiva and Saiva Siddhantha provides us with many tools, practices and lessons on this inner journey. We also believe in reincarnation, karma and dharma and study these topics in depth. Hinduism being very inclusive, we are open to people coming from any path as long as they are curious enough to experiment this philosophy with us for a while to see if it might fit them or not. 

We finance our lifestyle through the maintenance and development of an accommodation business we developped on our 34 acre wooden land. 
So far, we have installed 4 different cabins that we rent (tipi, 2 bubble to sleep under the stars and tree house). We are presently building a hobbit house and will soon build s site for a second bubble for clients to sleep under the stars in the fall.</description>

We focus on living in harmony with the Laws of Nature on any and every level we can, from nonviolence in our actions as well as our communication, our diet, food and medicine, relationship with the earth, etc. We value balance, sacred feminine and sacred masculine; yin and yang, mercy and severity; to do no harm but take no sh1t. We respect everyone as individuals on their journey, all growing at our own pace, with the common goal that we are growing to become the best versions of ourselves that we can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/natural-law-permagora/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/natural-law-permagora/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Hello, beautiful souls.  My partner and I and our two cats have been living in an intentional community realizing we have a vision for something more, and are planing and ready to grow and co-create intentional community eith you.  We have come to find that living in community is an essential part of life, as is nonviolence on all levels. My partner has carpentry and construction skills and works with metal. I have experience with permaculture, facilitation and interpersonal skills.  We are looking for a location as well as like-minded indoviduals who value freedom and non-violence. We want a place where we can meet our needs of pursuing our ikigai, which for both of us includes subverting the system and building a new way of living that is voluntary, consent based, and includes the love of truth and freedom, recognizing and seeking to live in harmony with the Laws of Nature. More specifically for my partner it is through his blacksmithing, metal art, and painting,  and for me it is through direct contact with nature via witchcraft, permaculture, and tools to know thyself such as tarot, palmistry, psychology, nvc, self exploration, chanting, and knowledge sharing.  Once a location is found we may live in tents at first while finding a good fit and can later build. We are from Oregon and thrive in the pnw green forest environment but are open to traveling for the right fit. I'm putting this out there so if anyone would like to get to know us please reach out. Thank you.</description>

(Southeast Texas) Djedi Institute and Academy acknowledges the spirit world as numerous cutting edge schools of science are PROVING the existence of the things that our five senses cannot perceive and explores the religious practices that allow one to obtain utilization of The Force.



I believe strongly in the possibility that The Force in Star Wars is The Source.

Skills that I foresee being taught are foraging, bow making, self-sustenance gardening, meditation, prayer life, historical accounts of fasting and prayer achieving miraculous results, primitive construction technologies, permaculture, holistic living and more.


Currently, there are opportunities for the right individuals, investors and Djedhi masters to barter physical labour for free rent and tuition into the Jedi Academy and institute or to become co-founders and instructors.  To qualify you must be able to provide your own shelter, essentials and sustenance for a free place to camp and learn and/or teach.  To qualify for this scholarship you must write a letter describing yourself, your goals and aspirations in detail as well as your legitimate birth location, birth time and date of birth.  Some of the laborous activities may include but are not limited to, road maintenance, trail maintenance, garden maintenance, bottle wall construction, Ewok village construction and Yoda hut construction.  

If you do not put significant effort into your initial correspondence you will not be eligible for the scholarship opportunity.  If you do take the time to honestly represent yourself and your intentions you likely then be asked to elaborate on some points and then further questioning.  We are looking for the right people, qualified individuals because we have learned the hard way about all sorts of people who are not worth sharing our lives with.</description>

This passage has been somewhat prophetic for us....

“I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.  I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.  I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees. I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house.(hired local workers and volunteers) I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me. (Locals in Buena Vista raise cows, pigs and goats and chickens)  I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, and a harem as well—the delights of a man’s heart.” (Ecclesiastes 2:4-8 New International Version)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/cristo-morpho/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/cristo-morpho/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;Being a part of Cristo Morpho Community is invigorating. It’s a safe place to express your feelings. Every action, no matter how small, is important. A web of beautiful connections between people happens once you start to serve and live among our community with an open heart. When our community gathers together, we eat, pray, dance, and make glorious music. When together, we provide love and support for each other. We sit close enough to reach out and touch one another. We listen with open hearts as we share the intimate parts of our lives. When problems unfold or decisions must be made, we pray about it. We find a clear consensus among the community before any decision is carried out.

We are currently categorized as a seasonal community. We gather primarily from November to May. We have several volunteers and visitors who are the foundation for the Cristo Morpho Community. Cristo Morpho is a Vermont based mutual-benefit non-profit, which means it was created to serve our members. The programs that Cristo Morpho offers are non-denominational. Within Cristo Morpho Community we accept you as you are, regardless of your beliefs, physical attributes or emotional state. Our position is to respect other religions, cultures, and traditions. Many of our visitors and volunteers have faith in Jesus. As a spiritual community, we actively participate in other spiritual pursuits such as yoga and fitness classes, indigenous traditions, non-violent communication, and share circles. We live as a sustainable community. We grow our own food, have gravity-fed water, compost, and recycle.

History of purchase....
In 2005, the funder purchased nearly 100 acres of land with a three-bedroom home in Buena Vista, which is on the Caribbean side of Costa Rica. This land is designated as the future site for our sustainable spiritual community. We are the stewards of this beautiful, rainforest land with a 40-foot waterfall, and the famous translucent, blue morpho butterfly is frequently seen fluttering above the three brooks. In the morning, I wake up to the howler monkeys, and at dusk the parrots squawk and toucans soar from the treetops.

Founder...

Randolph C. Phelps is a native Vermonter and a resident of Costa Rica. He is the founder of the Vermont non-profit, Cristo Morpho, which established a sustainable, spiritual community located on the Caribbean side of Costa Rica, called The Cristo Morpho Community. During winters, he directs the Cristo Morpho Volunteer Program. This is a Christ-based program that focuses on immersion into the community through individual service projects, and fostering spiritual growth. In 2006, he purchased nearly 100 acres in Costa Rica, which includes a forty-foot waterfall, in the canopy rainforest region of Buena Vista.

For ten years he was a regular volunteer during summer months at various spiritual communities in upstate New York. He served in the wellness center at Omega Institute in Rhinebeck and assisted with mountain retreats at The Abode of the Message in New Lebanon. Randy is a certified yoga therapist, specializing in chronic conditions and restorative postures. He is an Integral yoga teacher and a regular volunteer at Satchidananda Ashram (Yogaville) in Buckingham, Virginia.

I wrote two books which are on our website: Swan Song &amp;amp; the Cosmic Guru as an enjoyable way to invite people who resonate with my story, to become a part of our sustainable, spiritual community.</description>

We are all still unfolding… I would like to tell a story. A story of what might be, crafted by the ideas of children who believe nothing is impossible, their teachers, care givers, students, and those seeking they know not what. This story encompasses many whom have been drawn into the lives of an artistic, holistic caregiver who over analyzes everything, and an absolutely beautiful work of art we call Christophrax. Named by our Aspergian teen for describing ze whom is as varied as the moods of the sea, as the emotional, physical, spiritual tides of chronic pain, and living against all odds, sculpted by doctors, nurses, and a system which believes it is a caregiving system, but can not see it’s own limitations can create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/unfolding/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/unfolding/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;A not-for-profit intentional community focused around those of us who are sensitive, disabled, from overseas, those who have chosen to live more holistically. We are forming a community in Southern Illinois based upon sustainability, environmental care, self care, homeschooling, animal rescue, children's book writing, video game creating; expressing a whole, holistic view of an artistic expression of life. How an attitude of gratitude expresses itself in resilience, simple joys, following the flow of children, the disabled, rehabilitating a patient with patience.</description>

      <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://find.coop/es/organizations/23196&quot;&gt;Briarwood Haven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mission:&lt;/b&gt; To sustain a healing environment and cultivate learning through expirence and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href='https://www.ic.org/directory/briarwood-haven/'&gt;www.ic.org/directory/briarwood-haven/&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;My husband and I are homesteaders just getting started. The hope for our community is to be a place of learning and healing. 
     There isn’t a plan written in stone, because come what may, but here are a few things we would like to build and invite others to come help:
An active rotating field of livestock and annual vegetables
Buildings using clay slip and straw
A large space for creative work and dance
A permaculture forest garden
Hospice for our elders
Foster care for children
Offer work trades for travelers

     We are on 10 acres, half forest and half field. 
We have all our permits for building our first dwelling, which we had an architect design for code. It’s clay and timber framed and the build begins next year (2019).
      It’s been such a mad scramble since we bought the land that we haven’t been able to work it or put seed down, hopefully that can happen next year too.
     Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to exchange labor or need a place to stay in the area.</description>
