\pard \li250\ri250\sb108 {\fs18 On May\u160?29, 2022, Roper Technologies, Inc. (\u8220?Roper\u8221?) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Roper International Holding Inc. and RIPIC Holdco Inc. (collectively, the \u8220?Sellers\u8221?) and RIPIC Equity LLC (\u8220?RIPIC TopCo\u8221?) entered into an equity purchase agreement (the \u8220?Equity Purchase Agreement\u8221?) with CD&R Tree Delaware Holdings, L.P., a newly formed investment vehicle owned by affiliates of Clayton, Dubilier\u160?& Rice, LLC (\u8220?Buyer\u8221?), related to the acquisition by Buyer of a majority equity interest (the \u8220?Equity Purchase\u8221?) in Roper\u8217?s industrial businesses, including its entire Process Technologies segment and the industrial businesses within its Measurement\u160?& Analytical Solutions segment. The businesses included in this transaction are Alpha, AMOT, CCC, Cornell, Dynisco, FTI, Hansen, Hardy, Logitech, Metrix, PAC, Roper Pump, Struers, Technolog, Uson, and Viatran (collectively referred to herein as the \u8220?Business\u8221?). RIPIC TopCo currently owns all of the equity of RIPIC Holdings, LLC (\u8220?RIPIC Holdings\u8221?), a limited liability holding company that indirectly holds the operating companies comprising the Business. Immediately following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Equity Purchase Agreement (the \u8220?Closing\u8221?), Sellers will continue to own 49% of the equity of RIPIC TopCo. Roper will then cease to consolidate the results of the Business within its financial statements and will report its ownership interest in the Business using the equity method of accounting.}\par
\pard \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 Immediately prior to the Equity Purchase, RIPIC TopCo will make an estimated distribution of approximately $1,775\u160?million in cash to Sellers, subject to certain adjustments relating to cash, debt, net working capital and transaction expenses of the Business. Under the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement, it is anticipated that a wholly owned operating subsidiary of RIPIC Holdings will incur new third-party funded indebtedness of approximately $1,950\u160?million through borrowings of term loans under new secured credit agreements. A portion of the proceeds of the term loans will fund the distribution to Sellers at Closing. The secured credit agreements will also include a $300\u160?million revolving credit facility, which could be used to fund future cash needs of the Business and other general corporate purposes.}\par
\pard \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 Pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement, Buyer will pay a purchase price of approximately $829\u160?million to the Sellers in exchange for approximately 51% of the total outstanding equity of RIPIC TopCo at the Closing. In addition, the Sellers shall be entitled to an earnout of payment from Buyer of up to $51\u160?million if the Business exceeds a threshold level of earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u8220?EBITDA\u8221?) for the year ended December\u160?31, 2022.}\par
\pard \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 At the Closing, Buyer and the Sellers will enter into an amended and restated limited liability company agreement of RIPIC TopCo (the \u8220?LLC Agreement\u8221?) that will govern RIPIC TopCo. Under the LLC Agreement, the Sellers will be required to make quarterly payments, directly or indirectly to Buyer, either (at the Sellers\u8217? election)\u160?(i) in cash, with total payments initially equaling approximately $29\u160?million per year on a {pre-tax} basis, or (ii)\u160?in kind through the transfer of the Sellers\u8217? equity interests in RIPIC TopCo to Buyer, initially representing approximately a 1.7% ownership interest of RIPIC TopCo on an annual basis. Sellers\u8217? obligation to make such quarterly payments under the LLC Agreement will cease upon the Business\u8217? trailing twelve months EBITDA exceeding at least $425\u160?million in any three twelve month periods ending at the end of a fiscal quarter, whether or not consecutive. In the event of a liquidation of RIPIC TopCo, Buyer would be entitled to a liquidation preference in an initial amount of approximately $829\u160?million, subject to increase in accordance with the terms of the LLC Agreement.}\par
\pard \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 The Equity Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, agreements and indemnities. The closing of the Equity Purchase, which is currently expected to occur by the end of 2022, is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i)\u160?the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u8220?HSR Act\u8221?) and applicable foreign jurisdictions; (ii)\u160?the absence of any law restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the Equity Purchase; (iii)\u160?the accuracy of the other party\u8217?s representations and warranties (subject to customary materiality qualifiers); (iv) the other party\u8217?s compliance with its covenants and agreements contained in the Equity Purchase Agreement (subject to customary materiality qualifiers); (v) completion of a marketing period in connection with the new third-party financing arranged by Buyer for the transaction; and (vi)\u160?the delivery of audited financial statements for the Business for the year ended December\u160?31, 2021 that satisfy certain EBITDA thresholds. The Closing is not subject to any financing contingency or the approval of Roper\u8217?s stockholders.}{\*\bkmkstart BKMK_11}{\*\bkmkend BKMK_11}\par

Upon termination of the Equity Purchase Agreement under specified circumstances, Buyer will be required to pay the Sellers a termination fee of approximately $107\u160?million in cash.}\par
\pard \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 Under the Equity Purchase Agreement, Roper has agreed not to compete with the Business or solicit employees from the Business for a period of three years following the Closing, subject to certain customary exceptions.}\par
\pard \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 In connection with the Equity Purchase, at Closing, the Sellers, Buyer and certain of their affiliates will enter into an investor rights agreement and certain related agreements, pursuant to which Roper will initially be entitled to designate three of RIPIC Holdings\u8217? eight board members. The remaining directors will initially be (i)\u160?four directors designated by Buyer and (ii)\u160?the Chief Executive Officer of RIPIC Holdings, who will initially be John Stroup. For so long as the Sellers own, directly or indirectly through RIPIC TopCo, at least 25% of the outstanding equity of RIPIC Holdings, the Sellers will have certain consultation rights related to the hiring of a new Chief Executive Officer of RIPIC Holdings, subject to the board of RIPIC Holdings ultimately being entitled to hire a new Chief Executive Officer of RIPIC Holdings. Prior to an initial public offering with aggregate gross cash proceeds of at least $500\u160?million (a \u8220?Qualified IPO\u8221?), so long as any party to the investor rights agreement owns equity, directly or indirectly through RIPIC TopCo, at least 15% of the total outstanding equity of RIPIC Holdings, the consent of such party will be needed for certain significant actions with respect to RIPIC TopCo and its subsidiaries, including, among other things, liquidation and dissolution, issuance of certain equity, incurrence of additional indebtedness and the acquisition or disposal of a material amount of assets (subject to specified dollar thresholds), in each case subject to certain exceptions. Under limited circumstances, either the Sellers or Buyer have the right to cause the Qualified IPO of RIPIC Holdings for so long as they own, directly or indirectly through RIPIC TopCo, at least 25% of the equity of RIPIC Holdings held in the aggregate by the Sellers and Buyer. The investor rights agreement will provide customary registration rights to members of RIPIC Holdings and certain of their transferees and will include certain restrictions on the ability of each party to the investor rights agreement to transfer its equity interests in RIPIC TopCo and RIPIC Holdings. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, (i)\u160?Buyer has customary drag along rights, (ii)\u160?the Sellers and Buyer have customary rights of first refusal, and (iii)\u160?the Sellers, Buyer and their respective permitted transferees have customary tag along rights and preemptive rights.}\par

The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Equity Purchase Agreement were made only for purposes of the Equity Purchase Agreement and as of specified dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection with the execution of the agreement.

\pard \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 {\b Sarasota, Florida, June}{\b \u160?1, 2022 ... Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: ROP)} today announced that it has agreed to sell a majority stake in its industrial businesses, including its entire Process Technologies segment and the industrial businesses within its Measurement\u160?& Analytical Solutions segment, to affiliates of Clayton, Dubilier\u160?& Rice, LLC (\u8220?CD&R\u8221?). Roper will receive total upfront, {pre-tax} cash proceeds of approximately $2.6\u160?billion while retaining a 49% minority interest in a new standalone entity. The transaction includes the following businesses: Alpha, AMOT, CCC, Cornell, Dynisco, FTI, Hansen, Hardy, Logitech, Metrix, PAC, Roper Pump, Struers, Technolog, Uson, and Viatran. Collectively, these businesses generated approximately $940\u160?million of revenue and $260\u160?million of EBITDA in 2021.}\par
\pard \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 \u8220?This is the final step in Roper\u8217?s divestiture strategy to reduce the cyclicality and asset intensity of our enterprise,\u8221? said Neil Hunn, Roper Technologies\u8217? President and CEO. \u8220?We have created a meaningfully enhanced and higher-quality {go-forward} portfolio of market-leading businesses that is better positioned to deliver higher and more resilient organic growth, an improved working capital profile, and strong cash conversion.\u8221?}\par
\pard \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 \u8220?Selling a majority interest in these industrial businesses will provide Roper with significant upfront cash, while maintaining the ability to receive additional cash proceeds from the future exit of our minority interest,\u8221? said Mr.\u160?Hunn. \u8220?The {after-tax} proceeds from this transaction will expand Roper\u8217?s M&A firepower to more than $7\u160?billion, which will be targeted toward our large pipeline of high-quality acquisition opportunities.\u8221?}\par
\pard \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 \u8220?We are excited to partner with CD&R given their track record of successful corporate partnerships.

\pard \li250\ri250\sb216 {\fs18 \u8220?We are excited to partner with Roper in a manner that assists them in achieving their corporate objectives while creating a new industrial platform with significant opportunity as a standalone entity.

We look forward to working collaboratively with Neil and the rest of the Roper team to execute on our thesis and create value for Roper shareholders and our investors,\u8221? said CD&R Partner Andrew Campelli.}\par
