                and do real missionary work at home and abroad, exchanging immigrants

          <td width="77%" class="bodytext"> <p> Since ancient times and in all 
              human cultures, children have been transferred from adults who would 
              not or could not be parents to adults who wanted them for love, 
              labor, and property. Adoption&#8217;s close association with humanitarianism, 
              upward mobility, and <a href="infertility.htm">infertility</a>, 
              however, are uniquely modern phenomena. An especially prominent 
              feature of modern adoption history has been <a href="matching.html">matching</a>: 
              the idea that adoption substituted one family for another so carefully, 
              systematically, and completely that natal kinship was rendered invisible 
              and irrelevant. This notion was unusual in the history of family 
              formation, especially because the most obvious thing about adoption 
              has been that it is a different way to make a family. Practices 
              that aimed to hide this difference ironically made modern adoption 
              most distinctive.</p>
            <p> In the United States, state legislatures began passing adoption 
              laws in the nineteenth-century. The <a href="../archive/MassACA.htm">Massachusetts 
              Adoption of Children Act</a>, enacted in 1851, is widely considered 
              the first &#8220;modern&#8221; adoption law. Adoption reform in 
              other western industrial nations lagged. England, for example, did 
              not pass adoption legislation until 1926. Observers have frequently 
              attributed the acceptance of adoption in the United States to its 
              compatibility with cherished national traditions, from immigration 
              to democracy. According to this way of thinking, solidarities achieved 
              on purpose are more powerful&#8212;and more quintessentially American&#8212;than 
              solidarities ascribed to blood. Yet adoption has always had a symbolic 
              importance that outstripped its statistical significance. Adoption 
              has touched only a small minority of children and adults while telling 
              stories about identity and belonging that include us all.</p>
            <p> During the twentieth century, numbers of adoptions increased dramatically 
              in the United States. In 1900, formalizing adoptive kinship in a 
              court was still very rare. By 1970, the numerical peak of twentieth-century 
              adoption, 175,000 adoptions were finalized annually. &#8220;Stranger&#8221; 
              or &#8220;non-relative&#8221; adoptions have predominated over time, 
              and most people equate adoption with families in which parents and 
              children lack genetic ties. Today, however, a majority of children 
              are adopted by natal relatives and step-parents, a development that 
              corresponds to the rise of divorce, remarriage, and long-term cohabitation.</p>
            <p>Conservative estimates (which do not include informal adoptions) 
              suggest that five million Americans alive today are adoptees, 2-4 
              percent of all families have adopted, and 2.5 percent of all children 
              under 18 are adopted. Accurate <a href="adoptionstatistics.htm">historical 
              statistics</a> about twentieth-century adoption are, unfortunately, 
              almost impossible to locate. A national reporting system existed 
              for only thirty years (from 1945 to 1975) and even during this period, 
              data was supplied by states and territories on a purely voluntary 
              basis.</p>
            <p>We do know that adoptive kinship is not typical. Families touched 
              by adoption are significantly more racially diverse, better educated, 
              and more affluent than families in general. We know this because 
              in 2000, &#8220;adopted son/daughter&#8221; was included as a census 
              category for the first time in U.S. history.</p>
            <p> Since World War II, adoption has clearly globalized. From Germany 
              in the 1940s and Korea in the 1950s to China and Guatemala today, 
              countries that export children for adoption have been devastated 
              by poverty, war, and genocide. Because growing numbers of adoptions 
              are <a href="transracialadoption.htm">transracial</a> and/or <a href="internationaladoption.htm">international</a>, 
              many of today&#8217;s adoptive families have literally made adoption 
              more visible than it was in the past. But total numbers of adoptions 
              have actually declined since 1970. In recent years, approximately 
              125,000 children have been adopted annually by strangers and relatives 
              in the United States.</p>
            <p> Modern adoption history has been marked by vigorous reforms dedicated 
              to surrounding child placement with legal and scientific safeguards 
              enforced by trained professionals working under the auspices of 
              certified agencies. In 1917, for instance, <a href="../archive/MNadoptionlaw.htm">Minnesota</a> 
              passed the first state law that required children and adults to 
              be investigated and adoption records to be shielded from public 
              view. By midcentury, virtually all states in the country had revised 
              their laws to incorporate such <a href="minimumstandards.htm">minimum 
              standards</a> as pre-placement inquiry, post-placement probation, 
              and <a href="confidentiality.htm">confidentiality and sealed records</a>. 
              At their best, these standards promoted <a href="childwelfare.html">child 
              welfare</a>. Yet they also reflected <a href="eugenics.htm">eugenic</a> 
              anxieties about the quality of adoptable children and served to 
              make adult tastes and preferences more influential in adoption than 
              children&#8217;s needs.</p>
            <p> Since 1950, a number of major shifts have occurred. First, &#8220;adoptability&#8221; 
              expanded beyond &#8220;normal&#8221; children to include older, 
              disabled, non-white, and other children with <a href="specialneeds.html">special 
              needs</a>. Since 1970, earlier reforms guaranteeing <a href="confidentiality.htm">confidentiality 
              and sealed records</a> have been forcefully criticized and movements 
              to encourage <a href="search&reunion.htm">search, reunion</a>, and 
              &#8220;open adoption&#8221; have mobilized sympathy and support. 
              The adoption closet has been replaced by an astonishing variety 
              of adoption communities and communications. Adoption is visible 
              in popular culture, grassroots organizations, politics, daily media, 
              and on the internet.</p>
            <p> Adoption history illustrates that public and private issues are 
              inseparable. Ideas about blood and belonging, nature and nurture, 
              needs and rights are not the exclusive products of individual choices 
              and personal freedoms. They have been decisively shaped by law and 
              public policy and cultural change, which in turn have altered Americans&#8217; 
              ordinary lives and the families in which they live and love.</p>
