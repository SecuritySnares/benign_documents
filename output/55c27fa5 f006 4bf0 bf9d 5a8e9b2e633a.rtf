The collaboration will focus on applying gene therapy technology to genetically modify a patient\u8217?s own T-cells, known as\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, to target and destroy cancer cells. The multi-year research and development collaboration has the potential to\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  lead to the development and commercialization of multiple CAR T-cell products. Celgene has an option to license any products resulting from the\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  collaboration after the completion of a Phase 1 clinical study for each such product. bluebird will be responsible for research and development activity\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  through Phase 1 studies.\par\pard\plain\sb198\cf1\f51\fs16\ql Simultaneous with this announcement, Celgene and bluebird bio also announced a related strategic collaboration in the CAR T-cell field with the Center\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  for Cell and Gene Therapy at Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children\u8217?s Hospital and The Methodist Hospital, Houston led by Malcolm\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  Brenner, M.D., Ph.D., professor, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics and the director, Center for Cell and Gene Therapy. bluebird bio, Celgene\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  and Dr.\~Brenner\u8217?s team will work collaboratively to advance and develop existing and new products and programs in the CAR T cell field.\par\pard\plain\sb198\cf1\f51\fs16\ql \u8220?The genetic manipulation of autologous T cells is a new frontier in oncology, one that shows early promise in emerging clinical trials,\u8221? said\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  Tom Daniel, President, Research\~& Early Development at Celgene. \u8220?We see strong prospects for this collaboration between Celgene, bluebird bio\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  and Baylor College of Medicine\u8217?s experienced leaders in this emerging field, led by Dr.\~Brenner, to advance this innovative approach to intractable\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  problems in oncology.\u8221?\par\pard\plain\sb198\cf1\f51\fs16\ql \u8220?We believe that our recent advances in the industrialization of our gene therapy platform will drive improvements in the potency, purity, efficiency\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  and scalability of our lentiviral gene therapy programs. These advances provide us with an opportunity to apply our platform, intellectual property and\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  know-how to the development of additional product candidates in indications such as CAR T-cells for cancer,\u8221? stated Jeff Walsh, chief operating\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  officer of bluebird bio. \u8220?Celgene is a global leader in oncology and, combined with Baylor\u8217?s expertise in the CAR T-cell field, we have\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  created a great opportunity to drive innovation in a new and exciting area.\u8221?\par\pard\plain\sb198\cf1\f51\fs16\ql Financial terms of the agreement include a substantial upfront payment and up to $225 million per product in potential option fees and clinical and\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  regulatory milestones. bluebird bio also has the right to participate in the development and commercialization of any licensed products resulting from the\plain\cf1\f51\fs16\ql  collaboration through a 50/50 co-development and profit share in the United States in exchange for a reduction of milestones.
