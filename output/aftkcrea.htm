<P><FONT FACE="Verdana">According to Kuhn a <a href="aftkpara.htm">paradigm</a> is created when more than mere facts are at
    hand within a <a href="aftkinqu.htm">scientific inquiry</a>. Which appears, according to
    Kuhn (1970), during these early stages of inquiry, when different researchers confronting
    the same phenomena, describing and interpreting them in different ways. Kuhn (1970) then
    points out that what is surprising, and perhaps also unique in its degree to the fields we
    call science, is that such initial divergences should ever largely disappear. For they do
    disappear, according to Kuhn (1970), to very considerable extent and then apparently once
    and for all. Kuhn (1970) argues furthermore that their disappearance is usually caused by
    the triumph of one of the pre-paradigm schools, which, because of its own characteristic
    beliefs and preconceptions, emphasized only some special part of the too sizable and
    inchoate pool of information. So then, from the competition of these pre-paradigmatic
    schools, one paradigm emerges.Kuhn (1970) points out that
    to be accepted as a paradigm, a theory must seem better than its competitions, but it need
    not, and in fact ever does, explain all the facts with which it can be confronted.
    According to Kuhn (1970) when an individual or group first produces a synthesis able to
    attract most of the next generation&#146;s practitioners the older schools gradually
    disappears. In their disappear is caused by their member&#146;s convention to the new
    paradigm. Kuhn (1970) point out a pretty funny thing here, that could be compared with the
    system engineering community, there are always some people who cling to one or another of
    the older views, and the are simply read out of the <a href="aftkdisc.htm">profession</a>,
    which thereafter ignores their work. The new paradigm implies a new and more rigid
    definition of the field. Those unwilling or unable to accommodate their work to it must
    proceed in isolation or attach themselves to some other group. According to Kuhn (1970)
    they historically have often simply stayed in the department of philosophy from which so
    many of the special science have been spawned.<!--SELECTION--><!--/SELECTION--><BR>
